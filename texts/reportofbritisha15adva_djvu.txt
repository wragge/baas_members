money in aid of special research, which is made in any 
Section, shall be considered by the Committee of that Section ;

settle the terms of reference and suitable Members to serve 
on it, which must be as small as is consistent with its efficient 
working ; and shall nominate a Chairman and a Secretary. 
Such Research Committee, if appointed, shall have power to 
add to their numbers.

has been made, the Chairman is the only person entitled to call Qhairman" ^ 
on the General Treasurer for such portion of the sum granted 

as from time to time may be required.

Association does not contemplate the payment of personal 
expenses to the Members.

EEPOET OF THE COUNCIL, 1913-14. 

I. The Council have to record their profound sorrow at the death of 
Sir David Gill, F.E.S., ex-President. The following resolution was 
conveyed to Lady Gill by the President : — 

' The Council deeply regret the death ol their late distinguished 
President, Sir David Gill, whose personality was so widely 
appreciated, and whose woi-k for Astronomy at the Cape 
Observatory elevated it to the first rank ; and they empower 
the Officers to convey to Lady Gill and his family their 
profound sympathy. " 

IL Professor A. Schuster, F.E.S., has been unanimously nomi- 
nated by the Council to fill tEe office of President of the Association 
for 1915-16 (Manchester Meeting). 

III. Caird Fund. — (a) Eesolutions referred by the General 
Committee to the Council for consideration and, if desirable, for action, 
were dealt with as follows : — 

(1) ' That the Council be asked to appoint a Committee to cany 
out the request of Sir J. K. Caird in his letter of 
September 10 (viz., that his further gift of £1,000 be ear- 
marked for the study of Eadio- Activity as a branch of Geo- 
physics).' 

It was resolved to appoint the following Committee to carry out the 
above request: The President and General Officers, Sir E. Eutherford, 
Mr. F. Soddy, and Sir J. J. Thomson. The Committee was empowered 
to add to its number and to modify the condition attaching to the above 
gift, subject to the approval of Sir J. K. Caird. 

(2) ' That the request of Section A (Mathematics and Physics) 
for a grant from the Caird Fund of £500 for Eadio-telegraphic 
investigations be sent to the Council for consideration and 
action. ' 

It was resolved that the above request be granted, and that the 
General Treasurer be empowered to pay the sum named to the Chairman 
of the Committee appointed to conduct the said investigations. 

(3) ' That a grant of £100 for the coming year be made to the 
Committee on the Naples Table from^ the Caird Fund, and 
that the Council be requested to consider the advisability of 
endowing the Committee by a capital sum yielding an annual 
income of £100.' 

It was resolved that a grant of £100 for the coming year be made 
to the Committee on the Naples Table from the Caird Fund, and that 
a grant of £100 be made annually in future to the Committee, subject 
to the adoption of its annual report. 



Xl REPORT OF THE COUNCIL. 

(4) ' That a grant of £100 for the coming year be made to the 
Committee on Seismological Investigations from the Caird 
Fund, and that the Council be asked to consider the 
advisability of endowmg the Committee by a capital sum 
yielding an annual income of £100.' 

It was resolved that a grant of £100 for the coming year be made 
to the Committee on Seismological Investigations, and that a grant of 
£100 be made annually in future to the Committee, subject to the 
adoption of its annual report. 

(b) An application to the Council from the ' Scotia ' Publication 
Committee (Scottish Antarctic Expedition) for a grant of £400 from the 
Caird Fund towards the expenses of the publication of the ' Scientific 
Results of the Voyage of the " Scotia " ' was considered, and it was 
resolved that the application could not be entertained. 

IV. Resolutions referred to the Council by the General Committee 
at Birmingham for consideration, and, if desirable, for action, were 
dealt with as follows : — 

From Sections A and E. 

' That the terms First Order, Second Order, Third Order, and 
Fourth Order of triangulation, as connoting definite degrees 
of precision, be used to describe triangulation even though 
the terms now in use {e.g., Major, Minor, &amp;c.), which have 
only a local significance, are also employed. ' 

' That this resolution be communicated through the proper 
channels to (a) the Geodetic Association, and (fe) the Institute 
of Surveyors.' 

The Council approved the principle of the above resolution, and 
resolved that Professor H. H. Turner and Captain H. G. Lyons be 
appointed a Committee to communicate, in the name of the Council, 
with the Geodetic Association and the Institute of Surveyors. The 
Committee duly canned out this instruction. 

Fro7n Section I. 

' The Committee of Section I requests the Council of the 
Association to forward to the Board of Trade the following 
resolution : — 

(i) That Colour Vision Tests are most efficiently conducted 

by means of what is known as the " Lantern Test." 
(ii) That the best form of such lantern has not yet been 

finally decided upon, and can be arrived at only after 

further expert report, 
(iii) That the actual application of sight tests requires the 

co-operation of an ophthalmic surgeon with a practical 

navigator. ' 

The Council, after careful consideration and consultation among 
members specially interested in this question, resolved to take no action. 



REPORT OF THE COUNCIL. xli 

From Section I. 

' That in view of the fact that numerous deaths continue to take 
place from anaesthetics administered by unregistered persons, 
the Committee of the Section of Physiology of the British 
Association appeals to the Council of the Association to repi'e- 
sent to the Home Office and to the Privy Council the urgent 
need of legislation to protect the public against such 
unnecessary risks.' 

The Council appointed a Committee to consider and report upon 
the above resolution, and subsequently adopted the following resolution, 
which was transmitted to the Home Office: — 

' The Council of the British Association desire to urge upon 
His Majesty's Government the necessity of introducing legis- 
lation on the subject of the administration of anaesthetics, as 
recommended by the Departmental Committee of the Home 
Office, dated March 18, 1910, but with the addition to Recom- 
mendation (3) of a clause permitting administration by un- 
registered persons under the immediate supervision of a person 
duly qualified. The Council would point out that the recom- 
mendations of the General Medical Council are practically 
identical with those of the Departmental Committee, and that 
these recommendations have been approved by various 
academic and professional bodies, and also by the Council 
of this Association in 1910.' 

V. In connection with the Magnetic Ee-survey of the British Isles, 
referred to in the Eeport of the Council for 1912-13, the Council 
agreed to the proposal of the Royal Society that a joint supervising 
committee of the Society and the Association be appointed, and the 
following members were appointed to represent the Association : Sir 
Oliver Lodge, Prof. J. Periy, Prof. H. H. Turner, Dr. C. Chree, 
Dr. S. Chapman, Dr. P. W. Dyson, Dr. R. T. Glazebrook. 

The Council empowered the General Treasurer to pay from the 
Caird Fund a sum not exceeding £250 towards the cost of the Survey. 

VI. Australian Meeting. — (i) At their meeting in December 1913 
the Council were informed as to the limit of the total number of the 
oversea party which the Australian authorities had found it necessary 
to propose, having regard to the provision of suitable travelling 
facihties, &amp;c., in Australia. The Council were also informed that by 
counting all doubtful or qualified intimations from members, and all 
applications for new membership, the limit above mentioned was 
already substantially exceeded. It was resolved (a) that there should 
be no more admissions to the oversea party, excepting any member 
whose attendance the Australian Committee or the General Officers (in 
consultation, if necessary, with representatives of any particular 
Section) might decide to be of special importance to the scientific 
work of the meeting; (b) that the General Secretaries should be 
empowered to desire members v/hose intimations were qualified by 



Xlii REPORT OF THE COUNCIL. 

doubt to express their definite intentions by a certain date; (c) that 
the General Officers should be emjDowered to take, in the name of the 
Council, any other measures which might appear necessary to effect 
a reduction in the total number of the oversea party. 

(ii) Previously to the departure of Dr. A. 0. D. Eivett, General 
Organising Secretary in Australia, from London in December 1913, it 
was resolved that the thanks of the Council be expressed to Dr. Eivett 
for the assistance he had rendered in connection with the an-angements 
for the meeting during his visit to England, and to the authorities in 
Australia under whose direction he had paid this visit. 

VII. The Council resolved that the meetings of the Conference of 
Delegates of Corresponding Societies be held in Havre in August 1914 
on the occasion of the meeting there of L 'Association Frangaise pour 
I'Avancement des Sciences. 

In these circumstances the Council made the following appoint- 
ments on behalf of the General Committee (in place of nominations, 
as usual) : — 

Conference of Delegates. — Sir H. G. Pordham (Chairvmn) , Sir 
E. Brabrook {Vice-Chairman), Mr. "W. Mark Webb (Secretary).

Resolutions referred to the Coimcil for consideration, and, if desirable, 

for action. 

(a) From Sections A and C. 
'That in view of the fact that meteorites, which convey information of world- 
wide importxnce, are sometimes disposed of privately, in such a way as to deprive 
the public of this information, the Council be requested to take such steps as may 
initiate international legislation on the matter.' 

(b) From Section A. 

' That the British Association respectfully urge the need for the establishment 
in Australia of a Bureau of Weights and Measures, with the view of legalising the 



BBSEABCH COMMITTEES. IxV 

metric system as an alternative standard (as in Great Britain). They would also 
cordially welcome the inclusion of Australia as a member of the International 
Convention.' 

(o) From Section A. 

' That the British Association learns with great satisfaction that the State 
Government of Victoria has put a definite annual grant at the disposal of the 
Director of the Melbourne Observatory for printing the work already done at the 
Observatory. It is very desirable that every effort should be made to publish as soon 
as possible the arrears accumulated during the past thirty years.' 

(d'l From Sections C and E. 

' The Committees of the Geographical and Geological Sections of the British 
Association wish to draw attention to the high scientific value and practical 
importance of systematic glacial observation in New Zealand, and venture to urge 
upon the favourable consideration of the Government of the Dominion the great 
importarce of continuing and extending the work which is now being done in this 
direction by officers of the Government, as far as possible in conformity with the 
methods adopted by the Commission Internationale des Glaciers.' 

(e) From Sections Cand E. 

' The Geographical and Geological Sections of the British Association respect- 
fully request the Secretary of State for the Colonies to establish on certain islands 
in the Coral Seas— in extension of a plan that has lately been presented to His 
Excellency the Governor of Fiji, and by him submitted for the favourable con- 
sideration of the Legislative Council of that Colony— a number of bench-marks, 
with respect to which the mean level of the sea surface shall be accurately deter- 
mined once every ten years, in order to discover, after a century or longer, whether 
any change takes place in the altitude of land with respect to the sea. 

' It is suggested that a uniform plan for this work be prepared by the appropriate 
Government department, and that an abstract of the results obtained for each decade 
be forwarded to the British Association for publication.' 

(f) From, Section C, 

' That the Committee of Section C submits for favourable consideration to the 
committee of Recommendations of the British Association the question of urging 
the Federal and State Governments in Australia to co-operate in undertaking, as 
soon as possible, a gravity survey of the Earth's crust within the area of the 
Commonwealth. The Committee suggests that the work be commenced in the 
region of the Great Rift Valley of Australia, extending from near Adelaide north- 
wards to Lake Eyre.' 

(g) From Section E, 

' The Committee of Section E most warmly favours the project of a uniform 
Map of the World on a scale of 1 : 1,000,000, and expresses the hope that the sheets 
of Australia may be undertaken as soon as possible, on the same plan as has lately 
been adopted by the War Office in London for a map of Africa, and by the 
Geological Survey in Washington for the U.S.A. To this end they regard it as 
desirable that in the extensive surveys which the several States of the Common- 
wealth are carrying on, as much stress should be laid upon the geographical features 
of the land, the watercourses and the mountains, as upon property boundaries, and 
that in particular the determination of altitudes should be carried on, in order 
eventually to provide the basis for contoured maps.' 

(h) From Sections D and K. 

' It is with much pleasure that we ascertain that a Bill has been prepared by the 
present Government of South Australia for the establishment of a reserve of 300 
square miles situated on the western end of Kangaroo Island for the preservation of 
the fauna and flora, which are fast being exterminated on the mainland, and that 
this reserve will be placed under the control of a Board nominated by the University 
of Adelaide and the Government. We trust that this Bill will become law at an 
early date.' 



Ixvi RESEARCH COMMITTEES. 

(i) From the Covimittee uf Recommendations. 

'That in view of the successful issue of the Australian Meeting of the Associa- 
tion, the Council be asked to consider the best means of bringing into closer 
relationship the British Association and scientific representatives from the 
Dominions overseas.'

ADDEESS 

BY 

Professor WILLIAM BATESON, M.A,, F.R.S., 
PRESIDENT. 



Part I.— MELBOURNE.' 

The outstanding feature of this Meeting must be the fact that we are 
here — in Austraha. It is the function of a President to tell the 
Association of advances in science, to speak of the universal rather than 
of the particular or the temporary. There will be other opportunities 
of expressing the thoughts which this event must excite in the dullest 
heart, but it is right that my first words should take account of those 
achievements of organisation and those acts of national generosity by 
which it has come to pass that we are assembled in this country. Let 
us, too, on this occasion, remember that all the effort, and all the 
goodwill, that binds Australia to Britain would have been powerless to 
bring about such a resuft had it not been for those advances in science 
which have given man a control of the forces of Nature. For we are 
here by virtue of the feats of genius of individual men of science, 
giant-variations from the common level of our species ; and since I am 
going soon to speak of the significance of individual variation, I cannot 
introduce that subject better than by calling to remembrance the line 
of pioneers in chemistry, in physics, and in engineering, by the work- 
ing of whose rare — or, if you will, abnormal — intellects a meeting of 
the British Association on this side of the globe has been made physically 
possible. 

I have next to refer to the loss wthin the year of Sir David Gill, 
a former President of this Association, himself one of the outstanding 
great. His greatness lay in the power of making big foundations. He 
built up the Cape Observatory; he organised international geodesy; he 
conceived and canned through the plans for the photography of the 
whole sky, a work in which Atistralia is bearing a conspicuous part. 

^ Delivered in Melbourne on Friday, August 14, 1914.

president's address. 



Astronomical observation is now organised on an international scale, 
and of this great scheme Gill was the heart and soul. His labours have 
ensured a base from which others will proceed to discovery otherwise 
impossible. His name will be long remembered with veneration and 
gratitude. 

As the subject of the Addresses which I am to deliver here and 
in Sydney I take Heredity. I shall attempt to .give the essence 
of the discoveries made by Mendelian or analytical methods of 
study, and I shall ask you to contemplate the deductions which these 
physiological facts suggest in application both to evolutionary theory at 
large and tO' the special case of the natural history of human society. 

Eecognition of the significance of heredity is modern. The teriB 
itself in its scientific sense is no older than Herbert Spencer. Animals 
and plants are formed as pieces of living material split from the body 
of the parent organisms. Their powers and faculties are fixed in their 
physiological origin. They are the consequence of a genetic process, 
and yet it is only lately that this genetic process has become the subject 
of systematic research and experiment. The curiosity of naturalists 
has of course always been attracted to such problems ; but that accurate 
knowledge of genetics is of paramount importance in any attempt to 
understand the nature of living things has only been realised quite 
lately even by naturalists, and with casual exceptions the laity still 
know nothing of the matter. Historians debate the past of the human 
species, and statesmen order its present or profess to guide its future 
as if the animal Man, the unit of their calculations, with his vast 
diversity of powers, were a homogeneous material, which can be 
multiplied like shot. 

The reason for this neglect lies in ignorance and misunderstanding 
of the nature of Variation ; for not until the fact of congenital diversity 
is grasped, with all that it imports, does knowledge of the system of 
hereditary transmission stand out as a primary necessity in the con- 
struction of any theory of Evolution, or any scheme of human polity. 
The first full perception of the significance of variation we owe to 
Darwin. The present generation of evolutionists realises perhaps more 
fully than did the scientific world in the last century that the theoiy of 
Evolution had occupied the thoughts of many and found acceptance 
with not a few before ever the ' Origin ' appeared. We have come also 
to the conviction that the principle of Natural Selection cannot have 
been the chief factor in delimiting the species of animals and plants, 
such as we now with fuller knowledge see them actually tO' be. We 
are even more sceptical as to the validity of that appeal to changes in 
the conditions of life as direct causes of modification, upon which 
latterly at all events Darwin laid much emphasis. But that he was the 



I 



PRESIDENT S ADDRESS. O 

first to provide a body of fact demonstrating the variability of living 
things, whatever be its causation, can never be questioned. 

There are some older collections of evidence, chiefly the work of 
the French school, especially of Godron^ — and I would mention also 
the almost forgotten essay of Wollaston ' — these however are only 
fragments in comparison. Darwin regarded variability as a property 
inherent in hving things, and eventually we must consider whether this 
conception is well founded ; but postponing that inquiry for the present, 
we may declare that with him began a general recognition of variation 
as a phenomenon widely occurring in Nature. 

If a population consists of members which are not alike but differen- 
tiated, how will their characteristics be distributed among their off- 
spring? This is the problem which the modem student of heredity 
sets out to investigate. Formerly it was hoped that by ' the simple 
inspection of embryological processes the modes of heredity might be 
ascertained, the actual mechanism by which the offspring is formed 
from the body of the parent. In that endeavour a noble pile of 
evidence has been accumulated. All that can be made visible by 
existing methods has been seen, but we come little if at all nearer to 
the central mystery. We see nothing that we can analyse further — 
nothing that can be translated into terms less inscrutable than the 
physiological events themselves. Not only does embryology give no 
direct aid, but the failure of cytology is, so far as I can judge, equally 
complete. The chromosomes of nearly related creatures may be 
utterly different both in number, size, and form. Only one piece of 
evidence encourages the old hope that a connection might be traceable 
between the visible characteristics of the body and those of the chromo- 
somes. I refer of course to the accessory chromosome, which in many 
animals distinguishes the spermatozoon about to form a female in 
fertilisation. Even it however cannot be claimed as the cause of 
sexual differentiation, for it may be paired in forms closely allied to 
those in which it is unpaired or accessory. The distinction may be 
present or wanting, like any other secondary sexual character. Indeed, 
so long as no one can show consistent distinctions between the 
cytological characters of somatic tissues in the same individual we 
can scarcely expect to perceive such distinctions between the chromo- 
somes of the various types. 

For these methods of attack we now substitute another, less 
ambitious, perhaps, because less comprehensive, but not less direct. 
If we cannot see how a fowl by its egg and its sperm gives rise to

6 president's address. 

a chicken or how a Sweet Pea from its ovule and its pollen grain 
produces another Sweet Pea, we at least can watch the system 
by which the differences between the various kinds of fowls or 
between the various kinds of Sweet Peas ai-e distributed among the 
offspring. By thus breaking the main problem Uip into its parts 
we give ourselves fresh chances. This analytical study we call 
Mendelian because Mendel was the first to apply it. To be sure, he 
did not approach the problem by any such line of reasoning as I 
have sketched. His object was to determine the genetic definite- 
ness of species ; but though in his writings he makes no mention of 
inheritance it is clear that he had the extension in view. By cross- 
breeding he combined the characters of varieties in mongrel individuals 
and set himself to see how these characters wonld be distributed among 
the individuals of subsequent generations. Until he began this analysis 
nothing but the vaguest answers to such a question had been attempted. 
The existence of any orderly system of descent was nevex even sus- 
pected. In their manifold complexity human characteristics seemed 
to follow no obvious system, and the fact was taken as a fair sample 
of the working of heredity. 

Misconception was especially brought in by describing descent in 
terms of ' blood. ' The common speech uses expressions such as 
consanguinity, pure-blooded, half-blood, and the like, which call up a 
misleading picture to the mind. Blood is in some respects a fluid, 
and thus it is supposed that this fluid can be both quantitatively and 
qualitatively diluted with other bloods, just as treacle can be diluted 
with water. Blood in primitive physiology being the peculiar vehicle 
of life, at once its essence and its corporeal abode, these ideas of 
dilution and compounding of characters in the commingling of bloods 
inevitably suggest that the ingredients of the mixture once combined are 
inseparable, that they can be brought together in any relative amounts, 
and in short that in heredity we are concerned mainly with a quantita- 
tive problem. Truer notions of genetic physiology are given by the 
Hebrew expression ' seed.' If we speak of a man as ' of the blood- 
royal ' we think at once of plebeian dilution, and we wonder how much 
of the royal fluid is likely to be ' in his veins ' ; but if we say he is 
' of the seed of Abraham ' we feel something of the permanence and 
indestructibility of that germ which can be divided and scattered among 
all nations, but remains recognisable in type and characteristics after 
4,000 years. 

I knew a breeder who had a chest containing bottles of coloured 
liquids by which he used to illustrate the relationships of his dogs, 
pouring from one to another and titrating them quantitatively to illus- 
trate their pedigrees. Galton was beset by the same kind of mistake 
when he promulgated his ' Law of Ancestral Heredity.' With modern 



president's address. 



research all this has been cleared away. The allotment of character- 
istics among offspring is not accomplished by the exudation of drops 
of a tincture representing the sum of the characteristics of the parent 
organism, but by a process of cell-division , in which numbers of these 
characters, or rather the elements upon which they depend, are sorted 
out among the resulting germ-cells in an orderly fashion. "What these 
elements, or factors as we call them, are we do not know. That they 
are in some way directly transmitted by the material of the ovum and 
of the spermatozoon is obvious, but it seems to me unlikely that they 
are in any simple or literal sense material particles. I suspect rather 
that their properties depend on some phenomenon of anrangement. 
However that may be, analytical breeding proves that it is according 
to the distribution of these genetic factors, to use a non-committal term, 
that the characters of the offspring are decided. The first business of 
experimental genetics is to determine their number and interactions, 
and then to make an analysis of the various types of life. 

Now the ordinary genealogical trees, such as those which the stud- 
books provide in the case of the domestic animals, or the Heralds' 
College provides in the case of man, tell nothing of all this. Such 
methods of depicting descent cannot even show the one thing they are 
devised to show — purity of ' blood.' For at last we know the physio- 
logical meaning of that expression. An organism is pure-bred when it 
has been formed by the union in fertilisation of two germ-cells which 
are alike in the factors they bear ; and since the factors for the several 
characteristics are independent of each other, this question of purity 
must be separately considered for each of them. A man, for example, 
may be pure-bred in respect of his musical ability and cross-bred in 
respect of the colour of his eyes or the shape of his mouth. Though 
we know nothing of the essential nature of these factors, we know 
a good deal of their powers. They may 'confer height, colour, shape, 
instincts, powers both of mind and body — indeed, so many of the 
attributes which animals and plants possess, that we feel justified in 
tHe expectation that with continued analysis they will be proved to be 
responsible for most if not all of the differences by which the varying 
individuals of any species are distinguished from each other. T will 
not asseiii that the greater differences which characterise distinct Species 
are due generally to such independent factors, but that is the conclusion 
to which the available evidence points. All this is now so well under- 
stood, and has been so often demonstrated and expounded, that details 
of evidence are now superfluous. 

But for the benefit of those who are unfamiliar with such work let me 
briefly epitomise its main features and consequences. Since genetic 
factors are definite things, either present in or absent from any germ- 
cell, the individual may be either ' pure-bred ' for any particular factor, 



8 peesident's address. 

or its absence, if he is constituted by the union of two germ-cells both 
possessing or both destitute of that factor. If the individual is thus 
pure, all his germ-cells will in that respect be identical, for they are 
simply bits of the similar germ-cells which united in fertilisation to 
produce the parent organism. We thus reach the essential principle, 
that an organism cannot pass on to offspring a factor which it did not 
itself receive in fertilisation. Parents, therefore, which are both 
destitute of a given factor can only produce offspring equally destitute 
of it; and, on the contrary, parents both pure-bred for the presence 
of a factor produce offspring equally pure-bred for its presence. 
Whereas the germ-cells of the pure-bred are all alike, those of the 
cross-bred, which results from the union of dissimilar germ-cells, are 
mixed in character. Each positive factor segregates from its negative 
opposite, so that some germ-cells carry the factor and some do not. 
Once the factors have been identified by their effects, the average com- 
position of the several kinds of families formed from the various 
matings can be predicted. 

Only those who have themselves witnessed the fixed operations of 
these simple rules can feel their full significance. We come to look 
behind the simulacrum of the individual body, and we endeavour to 
disintegrate its features into the genetic elements by whose union the 
body was formed. Set out in cold general phrases such discoveries 
may seem remote from ordinary life. Become familiar with them and 
you will find your outlook on the world has changed. Watch the effects 
of segregation among the living things with which you have to do — 
plants, fowls, dogs, horses, that mixed concourse of humanity we call 
the English race, your friends' children, your own children, yourself — 
and however firmly imagination be restrained to the bounds of the 
known and the proved, you will feel something of that range of insight 
into Nature which Mendelism has begun to give. The question is 
often asked whether there are not also in operation systems of descent 
quite other than those contemplated by the Mendelian rules. I myself 
have expected such discoveries, but hitherto none have been plainly 
demonstrated. It is true we are often puzzled by the failure of a 
parental type to reappear in its completeness after a cross — the merino 
sheep or the fantail pigeon, for example. These exceptions may still 
be plausibly ascribed to the interference of a multitude of factors, a 
suggestion not easy to disprove; though it seems to me equally likely 
that segregation has been in reality imperfect. Of the descent of quan- 
titative characters we still know practically nothing. These and hosts 
of difficult cases remain almost untouched. In particular the discovery 
of E. Baur, and the evidence of Winkler in regard to his ' graft hybrids, ' 
both showing that the sub-epidermal layer of a plant — the layer from 
which the germ-cells are derived — may bear exclusively the characters 



president's address. 9 

of a pai't only of the soma, give hints of curious compHcations, and 
suggest that in plants at least the interrelations between soma and 
gamete may be far less simple than we have supposed. Nevertheless, 
speaking generally, we see nothing to indicate that qualitative characters 
descend, whether in plants or animals, according to systems which 
are incapable of factorial representation. 

The body of evidence accumulated by this method of analysis is 
now very large, and is still growing fast by the labours of many workers. 
Progress is also beginning along many novel and curious lines. The 
details are too technical for inclusion here. Suffice it to say that not 
only have we proof that segregation affects a vast range of characteris- 
tics, but in the course of our analysis phenomena of most unexpected 
kinds have been encountered. Some of these things twenty years ago 
must have seemed inconceivable. For example, the two sets of sex 
organs, male and female, of the same plant may not be carrying the 
same characteristics ; in some animals characteristics, quite independent 
of sex, may be distributed solely or predominantly to one sex; in 
certain species the male may be breeding true to its own type, while 
the female is permanently mongrel, throwing off eggs of a distinct 
variety in addition to those of its own type; characteristics, essentially 
independent, may be associated in special combinations which are 
largely retained in the next generation, so that among the grand- 
children there is numerical preponderance of those combinations which 
existed in the grandparents — a discovery which introduces us to a new 
phenomenon of polarity in the oiiganism. 

We are accustomed to the fact that the fertilised egg has a polarity, 
a front and hind end for example ; but we have now to recognise that it, 
or the primitive germinal cells formed from it, may have another 
polarity shown in the groupings of the parental elements. I am entirely 
sceptical as to the occurrence of segregation solely in the maturation of 
the germ-cells,* preferring at present to regard it as a special case of 
that patchwork condition we see in so many plants. These mosaics 
may break up, emitting bud-sports at various cell-divisions, and 1 
suspect that the great regularity seen in the F^ ratios of the cereals, for 
example, is a consequence of very late segregation, whereas the exces- 
sive irregularity found in other cases may be taken to indicate that 
segregation can happen at earlier stages of differentiation. 

The paradoxical descent of colour-blindness and other sex-limited 
conditions — formerly regarded as an inscrutable caprice of nature — has 
been represented with approximate correctness, and we already know 
something as to the way, or, perhaps, I should say ways, in which the 

* The fact that in certain plants the male and female organs respectively 
carry distinct factors may be quoted as almost decisively negativing the sug- 
gestion that segregation is confined to the reduction division. 



10 president's address. 

determination of sex is accomplished in some of the forms of hfe — 
though, I hasten to add, we have no inkhng as to any method by which 
that determination may be influenced or directed. It is obvious that 
such discoveries have bearings on most of the problems, whether 
theoretical or practical, in which animals and plants are concerned. 
Permanence or change of type, perfection of type, purity or mixture 
of race, ' racial development, ' the succession of forms, from being vague 
phrases expressing matters of degree, are now seen to be capable of 
acquiring physiological meanings, already to some extent assigned with 
precision. For the natm-alist — and it is to him that I am especially 
addressing myself to-day — these things are chiefly significant as relating 
to the history of organic beings — the theory of Evolution, to use our 
modern name. They have, as I shall endeavour to show in my second 
address to be given in Sydney, an immediate reference to the conduct 
of human society. 

I suppose that everyone is familiar in outline with the theory of 
the Origin of Species which Dai'\v'in promulgated. Through the last 
fifty years this theme of the Natural Selection of favoured races has been 
developed and expounded in writings innumerable. Favoured races 
certainly can replace others. The argument is sound, but we are doubt- 
ful of its value. For us that debate stands adjourned. We go to 
Darwin for his incomparable collection of facts. We would fain 
emulate his scholarship, his width and his power of exposition, but 
to us he speaks no more with philosophical authority. We read his 
gchenie of Evolution as we would that of Lucretius or of Lamarck, 
delighting in their simplicity and their courage. The practical and 
experimental study of Variation and Heredity has not merely opened 
a new field; it has given a new point of view and new standards of 
criticism. Naturalists may still be found expounding teleological 
systems' which would have delighted Dr. Pangloss himself, but at 
the present time few are misled. The student of genetics knows that 

° I take the following from the Abstract of a recent Croonian Lecture 
' On the Origin of Mammals ' delivered to the Royal Society : — ' In 
Upper Triassic times the larger Cynodonts preyed upon the large 
Anomodont, Kannemeijeria, and carried on their existence so long a.s these 
Anomodonts survived, but died out with them about the end of the Trias or 
in Ehretic times. The small Cynodonts, having neither small Anomodonts nor 
small Cotylosaurs to feed on, were forced to hunt the very active long-limbed 
Thecodonts. The greatly increased activity brought about that series of 
changes which formed the mammals— the flexible skin with hair, the four- 
chambered heart and warm blood, the loose jaw with teeth for mastication, 
an increased development of tactile sensation and a great increase of cerebrum. 
Not improbably the attacks of the newly evolved Cynodont or mammalian type 
brought about a corresponding evolution in the Pseudosuchian Thecodonts, which 
ultimately resulted in the formation of Dinosaurs and Birds.' Broom R

Ihe time for the development of theory is not yet. He would rathet 
stick to the seed-pan and the incubator. 

In face of what we now know of the distribution of variability in 
nature the scope claimed for Natural Selection in determining the fixity 
of Species must be greatly reduced. The doctrine of the survival of the 
fittest is undeniable so long as it is applied to the organism as a whole, 
but to attempt by this principle to find value in all definiteness of parts 
and functions, and in the name of Science to see fitness everywhere 
is mere eighteenth-century optimism. Yet it was in application to the 
parts, to the details of specific difference, to the spots on the peacock's 
tail, to the colouring of an Orchid flower, and hosts of such examples, 
that the potency of Natural Selection was urged with the strongest 
emphasis. Shorn of these pretensions the doctrine of the survival of 
favoured races is a truism, helping scarcely at all to account for the 
diversity of species. Tolerance plays almost as considerable a part. 
By these admissions almost the last shred of that teleological fustian 
with which Victorian philosophy loved to clothe the theory of Evolu- 
tion is destroyed. Those who would proclaim that whatever is is right 
will be wise henceforth to base this faith frankly on the impregnable 
rock of superstition, and to abstain from direct appeals to natural fact. 

My predecessor said last year that in physics the age is one of rapid 
progress and profound scepticism. In at least as high a degree this is 
true of Biology, and as a chief characteristic of modern evolutionary 
thought we must confess also to a deep but irksome humility in 
presence of great vital problems. Every theory of Evolution must be 
such as to accord with the facts of physics and chemistry, a primary 
necessity to which our predecessors paid small heed. For them the 
unknown was a rich mine of possibilities on which they could freely 
draw. For us it is rather an impenetrable mountain out of which the 
truth can be chipped in rare and isolated fragments. Of the physics and 
chemistry of hfe we know next to noohing. Somehow the characters 
of Hving things are bound up in properties of colloids, and are largely 
determined by the chemical powers of enzymes, but the study of these 
classes of matter has only just begun. Living things are found by a 
simple experiment to have powers undreamt of, and who knows what 
may be behind? 

Naturally we turn aside from generalities. It is no time to discuss 
the origin of the MoUusca or of Dicotyledons, while we are not even 
sure how it came to pass that Primula obconica has in twenty-five years 
produced its abundant new forms almost under our eyes. Knowledge 
of heredity has so reacted on our conceptions of variation that very 
competent men are even denying that variation in the old sense is a 
genuine occurrence at all. Variation is postulated as the basis of all 
evolutionary change. Do we then as a matter of fact find in the world 



12 president's address. 

about us variations occurring of auch a kind as to warrant faith in a 
contemporary progressive Evolution? Till lately most of us would 
have said ' yes ' without misgiving. We should have pointed, as 
Darwin did, to the immense range of diversity seen in many wild 
species, so commonly that the difficulty is to define the types them- 
selves. Still more conclusive seemed the profusion of forms in the 
various domesticated animals and plants, most of them incapable of 
existing even for a generation in the wild state, and therefore fixed 
unquestionably by human selection. These, at least, for certain, are 
new forms, often distinct enough to pass for species, wdiich has arisen 
by variation. But when analysis is applied to this mass of variation 
the matter weai's a different aspect. Closely examined, what is the 
' variability ' of wild species ? What is the natural fact which is 
denoted by the statement that a given species exhibits much variation ? 
Generally one of two things : either that the individuals collected in one 
locality differ among themselves; or perhaps more often that samples 
from separate localities differ from each other. As direct evidence of 
Yariation it is clearly to the first of these phenomena that we must 
have recourse — the heterogeneity of a population breeding together in 
one area. This heterogeneity may be in any degree, ranging from 
slight differences that systematists would disregard, to a complex 
variability such as we find in some moths, where there is an abund- 
ance of varieties so distinct that many would be classified as specific 
forms but for the fact that all are freely breeding together. Naturalists 
formerly supposed that any of these varieties might be bred from any 
of the others. Just as the reader of novels is prepared to find that 
any kind of parents may have any kind of childi'en in the course of the 
story, so was the evolutionist ready to believe that any pair of moths 
might produce any of the varieties included in the species. Genetic 
analysis has disposed of all these mistakes. We have no longer the 
smallest doubt that in. all these examples the varieties stand in a regular 
descending order, and that they are simply terms in a series of com- 
binations of factors separately transmitted, of which each may be 
present or absent. 

The appearance of contemporary variability proves to be an illusion. 
Variation from step to step in the series must occur either by the 
addition or by the loss of a factor. Now, of the origin of new forms 
by loss there seems to me to be fairly clear evidence, but of the con- 
temporary acquisition of any new factor I see no satisfactory proof, 
though I admit there are rare examples which may be so interpreted. 
We are left with a picture of variation utterly different from that 
which we saw at first. Variation now stands out as a definite physio- 
logical event. W^e have done with the notion that Darwin came latterly 
to favour, that large differences can arise by accumulation of small 



president's address. 13 

differences. Such small differences are often mere ephemeral effects 
of conditions of life, and as such are not transmissible ; but even small 
differences, when truly genetic, are factorial like the larger ones, and 
there is not the slightest reason for supposing that they are capable 
of summation. As to the origin or source of these positive separable 
factors, we are without any indication or surmise. By their effects 
we know them to be definite, as definite, say, as the organisms which 
produce diseases ; but how they arise and how they come to take part 
in the composition of the living creature so that when present they are 
treated in cell-division as constituents of the germs, we cannot con- 
jecture. 

It was a commonplace of evolutionary theory that at least the 
domestic animals have been developed from a few wild types. Their 
origin was supposed to present no difficulty. The various races of 
fowl, for instance, all came from Gallus bankiva, the Indian jungle- 
fowl. So we are taught; but try to reconstruct the steps in their 
evolution and you realise your hopeless ignorance. To be sure there 
are breeds, such as Black-red Game and Brown Leghorns, which have 
the colours of the jungle-fowl, though they differ in shape and other 
respects. As we know so little as yet of the genetics of shape, let us 
assume that those transitions could be got over. Suppose, further, as 
is probable, that the absence of the maternal instinct in the Ijeghorn 
is due to loss of one factor which the jungle-fowl possesses. So far 
we are on fairly safe ground. But how about White Leghorns ? Their 
origin may seem easy to imagine, since white varieties have often 
arisen in well-authenticated cases. But the white of White Leghorns 
is not, as white in nature often is, due to the loss of the colour-elements, 
but to the action of something which inhibits their expression. Whence 
did that something come ? The same question may be asked respecting 
the heavy breeds, such as Malays or Indian Game. Each of these is a 
separate introduction from the East. To suppose that these, with their 
peculiar combs and close feathering, could have been developed from 
pre-existing European breeds is very difficult. On the other hand, 
there is no wild species now living any more hke them. We may, of 
course, postulate that there was once such a species, now lost. That 
is quite conceivable, though the suggestion is purely speculative. I 
might thus go through the list of domesticated animals and plants of 
ancient origin and again and again we should be driven to this 
suggestion, that many of their distinctive characters must have been 
derived from some wild original now lost. Indeed, to this unsatisfying 
conclusion almost every careful writer on such subjects is now reduced. 
If we turn to modern evidence the case looks even worse. The new 
breeds of domestic animals made in recent times are the carefully 
selected products of recombination of pre-existing breeds. Most of the 



14 president's address, 

new varieties of cultivated plants are the outcome of deliberate crossing. 
There is generally no doubt in the matter. We have pretty full 
histories of these cix&gt;sses in Gladiolus, Orchids, Cineraria, Begonia, 
Calceolaria, Pelargonium, &amp;c. A very few certainly arise from a single 
origin. The Sweet Pea is the clearest case, and there are others which 
I should name with hesitation. The Cyclamen is one of them, but 
we know that efforts to cross Cyclamens were made early in the cul- 
tural history of the plant, and they may very well have been success- 
ful. Several plants for which single origins are alleged, such as the 
Chinese Primrose, the Dahlia, and Tobacco, came to us in an already 
domesticated state, and their origins remain altogether mysterious. 
Formerly single origins were generally presumed, but at the present 
time numbers of the chief products of domestication, dogs, horses, 
cattle, sheep, poultry, wheat, oats, rice, plums, cherries, have in turn 
been accepted as ' polyphyletic,' or, in other words, derived from several 
distinct forms. The reason that has led to these judgments is that the 
distinctions between the chief varieties can be traced as far back as the 
evidence reaches, and that these distinctions are so great, so far tran- 
scending anything that we actually know variation capable of effecting, 
that it seems pleasanter to postpone the difficulty, relegating the critical 
differentiation to some misty antiquity into which we shall not be asked 
to jJenetrate. For it need scarcely be said that this is mere procrastina- 
tion. If the origin of a form under domestication is hard to imagine, it 
becomes nO' easier to conceive of such enormous deviations from type 
coming to pass in the wild state. Examine any two thoroughly distinct 
species which meet each other in their distribution, as, for instance, 
Lychnis diurna and vespertina do. In areas of overlap are many inter- 
mediate forms. These used to be taken to be transitional steps, and 
the specific distinctness of vespertina and diurna was on that account 
questioned. Once it is known that these supposed intergradea are 
merely mongrels between the two species the transition from one to the 
other is practically beyond our powers of imagination to conceive. If 
both these can survive, why has their common parent perished? Why 
when they cross do they not reconstruct it instead of producing partially 
sterile hybrids? I take this example to show how entirely the facts 
were formerly misinterpreted. 

When once the idea of a true-breeding — or, as we say, homozygous 
— type is grasped, the problem of variation becomes an insistent oppres- 
sion. What can make such a type vary? We know, of course, one 
way by which novelty can be introduced — by crossing. Cross two 
well-marked varieties — for instance, of Chinese Primula — each breeding 
true, and in the second generation by mere recombination of the various 
factors which the two parental types severally introduced, there will 
be a profusion of forms, utterly unlike each other, distinct also from 



president's address. 15 

the original parents. Many of these can be bred true, and if found 
wild would certainly be described as good species. Confronted by the 
difficulty I have put before you, and contemplating such amazing poly- 
morphism in the second generation from a cross in Antirrhinum, Lotsy 
has lately with great courage suggested to us that all variation may be 
due to such crossing. I do not disguise my sympathy with this effort. 
After the blind complacency of conventional evolutionists it is refresh- 
ing to meet so frank an acknowledgment of the hardness of the problem. 
Lotsy 's utterance will at least do something to expose the artificiality of 
systematic zoology and botany. Whatever might or might not be 
revealed by experimental breeding, it is certain that without such tests 
we are merely guessing when we profess to distinguish specific limits 
and to declare that this is a species and that a variety. The only defin- 
able unit in classification is the homozygous form which breeds true. 
When we presume to say that such and such differences are trivial and 
such others valid, we are commonly embarking on a course for which 
there is no physiological warrant. Who could have foreseen that the 
Apple and the Pear — so like each other that their botanical differences 
are evasive — could not be crossed together, though species of Antir- 
rhinum so totally unlike each other as niajus and 7nolle can be 
hybridized, as Baur has shown, without a sign of impaired fertility? 
Jordan was perfectly right. The true-breeding forms which he dis- 
tinguished in such multitudes are real entities, though the great 
systematists, dispensing with such laborious analysis, have pooled them 
into arbitrary Linnean species, for the convenience of collectors and for 
the simplification of catalogues. Such pragmatical considerations may 
mean much in the museum, but with them the student of the physio- 
logy of variation has nothing to do. These 'little species,' finely cut,, 
true-breeding, and innumerable mongrels between them, are what he 
finds when he examines any so-called variable type. On analysis the 
semblance of variability disappears, and the illusion is shown to be due 
to segregation and recombination of series of factors on pre-determined 
lines. As soon as the ' little species ' are separated out they are found 
to be fixed. In face of such a result we may well ask with Lotsy, 
is there such a thing as spontaneous variation anywhere? His answer 
is that there is not. 

Abandoning the attempt to show that positive factors can be added 
to the original stock, we have further to confess that we cannot 
often actually jsrove variation by loss of factor to be a real pheno- 
menon. Lotsy doubts whether even this phenomenon occurs. The 
sole source of variation, in his view, is crossing. But here I 
think he is on unsafe ground. When a v,'ell-established variety like 
' Crimson King ' Primula, bred by Messrs. Sutton in thousands of 
individuals, gives off, as it did a few years since, a salmon-coloured 



16 president's address. 

variety, 'Coral King,' we might claim this as a genuine example o! 
variation by loss. The new variety is a simple recessive. It differs 
from ' Crimson King ' only in one respect, the loss of a single colour- 
factor, and, of course, bred true from its origin. To account for the 
appearance of such a new form by any process of crossing is exceedingly 
difficult. From the nature of the case there can have been no cross 
since ' Crimson King ' was established, and hence the salmon must 
have been concealed as a recessive from the first origin of that variety, 
even when it was represented by very few individuals, probably only by 
a single one. Surely, if any of these had been heterozygous for salmon 
this recessive could hardly have failed to appear during the process of 
self-fertilisation by which the stock would be multiplied, even though 
that selfing may not have been strictly carried out. Examples like this 
seem to me practically conclusive.® They can be challenged, but not, 
I think, successfully. Then again in regard to those variations in 
number and division of parts which we call meristic, the .reference of 
these to original cross-breeding is surely barred by the circumstances in 
which they often occur. There remain also the rare examples men- 
tioned already in which a single wild origin may with much confidence 
be assumed. In spite of repeated trials, no one has yet succeeded in 
crossing the Sweet Pea with any other leguminous species. We know 
that early in its cultivated history it produced at least two marked 
varieties which I can only conceive of as spontaneously arising, though, 
no doubt, the profusion of forms we now have was made by the crossing 
of those original varieties. I mention the Sweet Pea thus prominently 
for another reason, that it introduces us to another though subsidiary 
form of variation, which may be described as a fractionation of factors. 
Some of my Mendelian colleagues have spoken of genetic factors as 
permanent and indestructible. Eelative permanence in a sense thej 
have, for they commonly come out unchanged after segregation. But 
I am satisfied that they may occasionally undergo a quantitative dis- 
integration, with the consequence that varieties are produced inter- 
mediate between the integral varieties from which they were derived. 
These disintegrated conditions I have spoken of as subtraction — or 
reduction — stages. For example, the Picotee Sweet Pea, with its 
purple edges, can surely be nothing but a condition produced by the 
factor which ordinarily makes the fully purple flower, quantitatively 
diminished. The pied animal, such as the Dutch rabbit, must similarly 
be regarded as the result of partial defect of the chromogen from which 
the pigment is formed, or conceivably of the factor which effects its 
oxidation. On such lines I think we may Avith gi'eat confidence

T. H. Morgan and his colleagues in the fly, Drosophila, may also 'be cited as

president's address. 17 

interpret all those intergrading forms which breed true and are not 
produced by factorial interference. 

It is to be inferred that these fractional degradations are the con- 
sequence of irregularities in segregation. We constantly see irregulari- 
ties in the ordinary meristic processes, and in the distribution of somatic 
differentiation. We are familiar with half segments, with imperfect 
twinning, with leaves partially petaloid, with petals partially sepaloid. 
All these are evidences of departures from the normal regularity in the 
rhythms of repetition, or in those waves of differentiation by which the 
qualities are sorted out among the parts of the body. Similarly, when 
in segregation the qualities are sorted out among the germ-cells in 
certain critical cell-divisions, we cannot expect these differentiating 
divisions to be exempt from the imperfections and iiTegularities which 
are found in all the grosser divisions that we can observe. If I am 
I'ight, we shall find evidence of these irregularities in the association 
of unconformable numbers with the appearance of the novelties which 
I have called fractional. In passing let us note how the history of the 
Sweet Pea belies those ideas of a continuous evolution with which we 
had formerly to contend. The big varieties came first. The little ones 
have arisen later, as I suggest by fractionation. Presented with a 
collection of modern Sweet Peas how prettily v,'ould the devotees of 
Continuity have arranged them in a graduated series, showing how 
every intergrade could be found, passing from the full colour of the 
wild Sicilian species in one direction to white, in the other to the 
deep purple of ' Black Prince, ' though happily we know these two to be 
among the earliest to have appeared. 

Having in view these and other considerations which might be 
developed, I feel no reasonable doubt that though we may have to 
forgo a claim to variations by addition of factors, yet variation both by 
loss of factors and by fractionation of factors is a genuine phenomenon 
of contemporary nature. If then we have to dispense, as seems likely, 
with any addition from without we must begin seriously to consider 
whether the course of Evolution can at all reasonably be represented as 
an unpacking of an original complex which contained within itself the 
whole range of diversity which living things present. I do not suggest 
that we should come to a judgment as to what is or is not probable in 
these respects. As I have said already, this is no time for devising 
theories of Evolution, and I propound none. But as we have got to 
recognise that there has been an Evolution, that somehow or other the 
forms of life have arisen from fewer forms, we may as well see whether 
we are limited to the old view that evolutionary progress is from the 
simple to the complex, and whether after all it is conceivable that the 
process was the other way about. When the facts of genetic discovery 
become familiarly known to biologists, and cease to be the preoccupa-

18 president's address, 

tion of a few, as they etill are, many and long discussions must 
inevitably arise on the question, and I offer these remarks to pre- 
pare the ground. I ask you simply to open your minds to this 
possibility. It involves a certain effort. We have to reverse our 
habitual modes of thought. At first it may seem rank absurdity to 
suppose that the primordial form or fonns of protoplasm could have 
contained complexity enough to produce the divers types of life. But 
is it easier to imagine that these powers could have been conveyed by 
extrinsic additions ? Of what nature could these additions be ? Additions 
of material cannot surely be in question. We are told that salts of 
iron in the soil may turn a pink hydrangea blue. The iron cannot be 
passed on to the next generation. How can the iron multiply itself? 
The power to assimilate the iron is all that can be transmitted. A 
disease-producing organism like the pebrine of silkworms can in a very 
few cases be passed on tlirough the germ-cells. Such an organism can 
multiply and can produce its characteristic effects in the next genera- 
tion. But it does not become part of the invaded host, and we cannot 
conceive it taking part in the geometrically ordered processes of segre- 
gation. These illustrations may seem too gross; but what refinement 
will meet the requhements of the problem, that the thing introduced 
must be, as the living organism itself is, capable of multiplication and 
of subordinating itself in a definite system of segregation ? That which 
is conferred in variation must rather itself be a change, not of material, 
but of arrangement, or of motion. The invocation of additions extrinsic 
to the organism does not seriously help us to imagine How the power to 
change can be conferred, and if it prove that hope in that direction 
must be abandoned, I think we lose very little. By the re-arrangement 
of a very moderate number of things we soon reach a number of possi- 
bilities practically infinite. 

That primordial life may have been of small dimensions need not 
disturb us. Quantity is of no account in these considerations. 
Shakespeare once existed as a speck of protoplasm not so big as a 
small pin's head. To this nothing was added that would not equally 
well have served to build up a baboon or a rat. Let us consider how far 
we can get by the process of removal of what we call 'epistatic ' factors, 
in other words those that control, mask, or suppress underlying powers 
and faculties. I have spoken of the vast range of colours exhibited by 
modern Sweet Peas. There is no question that these have been derived 
from the one wild bi-colour form by a process of successive removals. 
When the vast range of form, size, and flavour to be found among the 
cultivated apples is considered it seems difficult to suppose that all this 
variety is hidden in the wild crab-apple. I cannot positively assert that 
this is so, but I think all familiar with Mendehan analysis would agi'ee 
with me that it is probable, and that the wild crab contains presumably 



president's address. 19 

inhibiting elements which the cultivated kinds have lost. The legend 
that the seedlings of cultivated apples become crabs is often repeated. 
After many inquiries among the raisers of apple seedlings I have never 
found an authentic case — once only even an alleged case, and this 
on inquiry proved to be unfounded. I have confidence that the artistic 
gifts of mankind will prove to be due not to something added to the 
make-up of an- ordinary man, but to the absence of factors which in the 
normal person inhibit the development of these gifts. They are almost 
beyond doubt to be looked upon as releases of powers normally sup- 
pressed. The instrument is there, but it is 'stopped down.' The 
scents of flowers or fruits, the finely repeated divisions that give its 
quality to the wool of the Merino, or in an analogous case the multi- 
plicity of quills to the tail of the fantail pigeon, are in all probability 
other examples of such releases. You may ask what guides us in the 
discrimination of the positive factors and how we can satisfy ourselves 
that the appearance of a quality is due to loss. It must be conceded 
that in these determinations we have as yet recourse only to the effects 
of dominance. When the tall pea is crossed with the dwarf, since the 
offspring is tall we say that the tall parent passed a factor into the 
cross-bred which makes it tall. The pure tall parent had two doses of 
this factor ; the dwarf had none ; and since the cross-bred is tall we say 
that one dose of the dominant tallness is enough to give the full height. 
The reasoning seems unanswerable. But the commoner result of cross- 
ing is the production of a form intermediate between the two pure 
parental types. In such examples we see clearly enough that the full 
parental characteristics can only appear when they are homozygous — ■ 
formed from similar geiTn-cells, and that one dose is insufficient to 
produce either effect fully. When this is so we can never be sure 
which side is positive and which negative. Since, then, when dominance 
is incomplete we find ourselves in this difficulty, we perceive that the 
amount of the effect is our only criterion in distinguishing the positive 
from the negative, and when we return even to the example of the 
tall and dwarf peas the matter is not so certain as it seemed. Professor 
Cockerell lately found among thousands of yellow sunflowers one 
which was partly red. By breeding he raised from this a form wholly 
red. Evidently the /ellow and the wholly red are the pure forms, and 
the partially red is .he heterozygote. We may then say that the yellow 
is YY with two doses of a positive factor which inhibits the development 
of pigment; the red is yy, with no dose of the inhibitor; and the 
partially red are Yy, with only one dose of it. But we might be tempted 
to think the red was a positive characteristic, and invert the expressions, 
representing the red as RR, the partly red as Rr, and the yellow as 
rr. According as we adopt the one or the otlier system of expression 
we shall interpret the evolutionary change as one of loss or as one of 



20 president's address. 

addition. May we not interpret the other apparent new dominants in 
the same way? The white dominant in the fowl or in the Chinese 
Primula can inhibit colour. But may it not be that the original coloured 
fowl or Primula had two doses of a factor which inhibited this inhibitor ? 
The Pepper Moth, Amphidasys hetularia, produced in England about 
1840 a black variety, then a novelty, now common in certain areas, 
which behaves as a full dominant. The pure blacks are no blacker 
than the cross-bred. Though at first sight it seems that the black 
must have been something added, we can without absurdity suggest 
that the normal is the term in which two doses of inhibitor are present, 
and that in the absence of one of them the black appears. 

In spit-e of seeming perversity, therefore, we have to admit that 
there is no evolutionary change which in the present state of our know- 
ledge we can positively declare to be not due to loss. "When this ha6 
been conceded it is natural to ask whether the removal of inhibiting 
factors may not be invoked in alleviation of the necessity which has 
driven students of the domestic breeds to refer their diversities to 
multiple origins. Something, no doubt, is to be hoped for in that 
direction, but not until much better and more extensive knowledge of 
what variation by loss may effect in the living body can we have any real 
assurance that this difficulty has been obviated. We should be greatly 
helped by some indication as to whether the origin of life has been single 
or multiple. Modern opinion is, perhaps, inclining to the multiple 
theory, but we have no real evidence. Indeed, the problem still stands 
outside the range of scientific investigation, and when we hear the 
spontaneous formation of formaldehyde mentioned as a possible first 
step in the origin of life, we think of Harry Lauder in the character of 
a Glasgow schoolboy pulling out his treasures from his pocket — ' That's 
a wassher — for makkin' motor cars ' ! 

As the evidence stands at present all that can be safely added in 
amplification of the evolutionary creed may be summed up in the 
statement that variation occurs as a definite event often producing a 
sensibly discontinuous result; that the succession of varieties comes 
to pass by the elevation and estabhshment of sporadic groups of 
individuals owing their origin to such isolated events ; and that 
the change which we see as a nascent variation is often, perhaps 
always, one of loss. Modern research lends not the smallest encourage- 
ment or sanction to the view that gi-adual evolution occurs by the trans- 
fonnation of masses of individuals, though that fancy has fixed itself on 
popular imagination. The isolated events to which variation is due are 
evidently changes in the germinal tissues, probably in the manner in 
which they divide. It is likely that the occurrence of these variations 
is wholly irregular, and as to their causation we are absolutely without 
surmise or even plausible speculation. Distinct types once arisen, no 



president's address. 21 

doubt a profusion of the forms called species have been, derived from 
them by simple crossing and subsequent recombination. New species 
may be now in course of creation by this means, but the limits of the 
process are obviously narrow. On the other hand, we see no changes in 
progress around us in the contemporary woi'ld which we can imagine 
likely to culminate in the evolution of forms distinct in the larger sense. 
By intercrossing dogs, jackals, and wolves new forais of these types 
can be made, some of which may be species, but I see no reason to 
think that fi'om such material a fox could be bred in indefinite time, or 
that dogs could be bred from foxes. 

Whether Science will hei'eafter discover that certain groups can by 
peculiarities in their genetic physiology be declared to have a preroga- 
tive quality justifying their recognition as species in the old sense, and 
that the differences of others are of such a subordinate degree that they 
may in contrast be termed varieties, further genetic research alone can 
show. I myself anticipate that such a discovery will be made, but I 
cannot defend the opinion with positive conviction. 

Somewhat reluctantly, and rather from a sense of duty, I have 
devoted most of this Address to the evolutionary aspects of genetic 
research. We cannot keep these things out of our heads, though some- 
times we wish we could. The outcome, as you will have seen, is 
negative, destroying much that till lately passed for gospel. Destruc- 
tion may be useful, but it is a low kind of work. We are just about 
where Boyle was in the seventeenth, century. We can dispose of 
Alchemy, but we cannot make more than a quasi-chemistry. We are 
awaiting our Priestley and our Mendel6eff. In truth it is not these 
wider aspects of genetics that are at present our chief concern. They 
will come in their time. The great advances of science are made like 
those of evolution, not by imperceptible mass-improvement, but by the 
sporadic bh-th of penetrative genius. The journeymen follow after him, 
widening and clearing up, as we are doing along the track that Mendel 
found. 



Part II.— SYDNEY.' 

At Melbourne I spoke of the new knowledge of the properties of 
living things which Mendelian analysis has brought us. I indicated 
how these discoveries are affecting our outlook on that old problem 
of natural history, the origin and nature of Species, and the chief 
conclusion I drew was the negative one, that, though we must hold 
to our faith in the Evolution of Species, there is little evidence as to 
how it has come about, and no clear proof that the process is con- 
tinuing in any considerable degree at the present time. The thought

uppermost in our minds is that knowledge of the nature of hfe is 
altogether too slender to warrant speculation on these fundamental 
subjects. Did we presume to offer such speculations thej' would 
have no more value than those which alchemists might have made as 
to the nature of the elements. But though in regard to these 
theoretical aspects we must confess to such deep ignorance, enough has 
been learnt of the general course of heredity within a single species to 
justify many practical conclusions Avhich cannot in the main be shaken. 
T propose now to develop some of these conclusions in regard to our 
own species, Man. 

In my former Address I mentioned the condition of certain animals 
and plants which are what we call ' polymorphic. ' Their populations 
consist of individuals of many types, though they breed freely together 
with perfect fertility. In cases of this kind which have been suffi- 
ciently investigated it has been found that these distmctions — some- 
times very great and affecting most diverse features of organisation — 
are due to the presence or absence of elements, or factors as we call 
them, which are treated in heredity as separate entities. These 
factors and their combinations produce tlie characteristics which we 
perceive. No individual can acquire a particular characteristic unless 
the requisite factors entered into the composition of that individual 
at fertilisation, being received either from the father or from the 
mother or from both, and consequently no individual can pass on to 
his offspring positive characters which he does not himself possess. 
Rules of this kind have already been traced in operation in the human 
species; and though I admit that an assumption of some magnitude 
is involved when we extend the application of the same system to 
human characteristics in general, yet the assumption is one which 
I believe we are fully justified in making. With little hesitation we 
can now declare that the potentialities and aptitudes, physical as v\ell 
as mental, sex, colours, powers of work or invention, liability to 
diseases, possible duration of life, and the other features by which the 
members of a mixed population differ from each other, are determined 
from the moment of fertilisation; and by all that we know of heredity 
in the forms of life with which we can experiment we ai'e compelled 
to believe that these qualities are in the main distributed on a factorial 
system. By changes in the outward conditions of life the expression 
of some of these powers and features may be excited or restrained. 
For the development of some an external opportunity is needed, and 
if that be withheld the character is never seen, any more than if the 
body be starved can the full height be attained; but such influences 
are superficial and do not alter the genetic constitution. 

The factors which the individual receives from his parents and no 
others are those which he can transmit to his offspring; and if a factor

was received from one parent only, not more than hal£ the offspring, 
on an average, will inherit it. What is it that has so long prevented 
mankind from discovering such simple facts? Primarily the circum- 
stance that as man must have Hvo parents it is not possible quita 
easily to detect the contributions of each. The individual body is a 
doiible structure, whereas the germ-cells are single. Two germ-cells 
unite to produce each individual body, and the ingredients they respec- 
tively contribute interact in ways that leave the ultimate product a 
medley in which it is difficult to identify the several ingredients. When, 
however, their effects are conspicuous the task is by no means impos- 
sible. In part also even physiologists have been blinded by the survival 
of ancient and obscurantist conceptions of the nature of man by which 
they were discouraged from the application of any rigorous analysis. 
Medical literature still abounds with traces of these archaisms, and, 
indeed, it is only quite recently that prominent horse-breeders have 
come to see that the dam matters as much as the sire. For them, 
though vast pecuniary considerations were involved, the old ' homun- 
culus ' theory was good enough. We were amazed at the notions 
of genetic physiology which Professor Baldwin Spencer encountered 
in his wonderful researches among the natives of Central Australia ; 
but in truth, if we reflect that these problems have engaged the atten- 
tion of civihsed man for ages, the fact that he, with all his powers 
of recording and deduction, failed to discover any part of the Mendelian 
system is almost as amazing. The popular notion that any parents 
can have any kind of children within the racial limits is contrary to 
all experience, yet we have gravely entertained such ideas. As I have 
said elsewhere, the truth might have been found out at any period 
in the world's history if only pedigrees had been drawn the right 
way up. If, instead of exhibiting the successive pairs of progenitors 
who have contributed to the making of an ultimate individual, some 
one had had the idea of setting out the posterity of a single ancestor 
who possessed a marked feature such as the Habsburg lip, and showing 
the transmission of this feature along some of the descending branches 
and the permanent loss of the feature in collaterals, the essential 
truth that heredity can be expressed in terms of presence and absence 
must have at once become apparent. For the descendant is not, as he 
appears in the conventional pedigree, a sort of pool into which each 
tributary ancestral stream has poured something, but rather a con- 
glomerate of ingredient-characters taken from his progenitors in such 
a way that some ingredients are represented and others are omitted. 

Let me not, however, give the impression that the unravelling of 
such descents is easy. Even with fairly full details, which in the case 
of man are very rarely to be had, many complications occur, often 
preventing us from obtaining more than a rough general indication of 



24 president's address. 

the system of descent. The nature of these comphcations we partly 
understand from our experience of animals and plants which are 
amenable to breeding under careful restrictions, and we know that 
they are mostly referable to various effects of interaction between 
factors by which the presence of some is masked. 

Necessarily the clearest evidence of regularity in the inheritance 
of human characteristics has been obtained in regard to the descent 
of marked abnormalities of stnicture and congenital diseases. Of the 
descent of ordinary distinctions such as are met with in the normal 
healthy population we know little for certain. Hurst's evidence, that 
two parents both with light-coloured eyes — in the strict sense, meaning 
that no pigment is present on the front of the iris — do not have dark- 
eyed children, still stands almost alone in this respect. With regard 
to the inheritance of other colour-characteristics some advance has been 
made, but everything points to the inference that the genetics of colour 
and many other features in man will prove exceptionally complex. 
There are, however, plenty of indications of system comparable with 
those which we trace in various animals and plants, and we are assured 
that to extend and clarify such evidence is only a matter of careful 
analysis. For the present, in asserting almost any general rules for 
human descent, we do right to make large reservations for possible 
exceptions. It is tantalising to have to wait, but of the ultimate result 
there can be no doubt. 

I spoke of comphcations. Two of these are worth illustrating here, 
for probably both of them play a great part in human genetics. It 
was discovered by Nilsson-Ehle, in the course of experiments with 
certain wheats, that several factors having the same power may co-exist 
in the same individual. These cumulative factors do not necessarily 
produce a cumulative effect, for any one of them may suffice to give 
the full result. Just as the pure-bred tall pea with its two factors for 
tallness is no taller than the cross-bred with a single factor, so these 
wheats with three pairs of factors for red colour are no redder than the 
ordinary reds of the same family. Similar observations have been 
made by East and others. In some cases, as in the Primulas studied 
by Gregory, the effect is cumulative. These results have been used 
with plausibility by Davenpoi't and the American workers to elucidate 
the curious case of the mulatto. If the descent of colour in the cross 
between the negro and the white man followed the simplest rule, the 
offspring of two first-ci'oss mulattos would be, on an average, one 
black : two mulattos : one white, but this is notoriously not so. 
Evidence of some segregation is fairly clear, and the deficiency of real 
whites may perhaps be accounted for on the hypothesis of cumulative 
factors, though by the nature of the case strict proof is not to be had. 
But at pi-esent I own to a preference for regarding such examples as 



president's address. 25 

instances of imperfect segregation. The series of germ-oells produced 
by the cross-bred consists of some with no black, some with full black, 
and others with intermediate quantities of black. No statistical tests 
of the condition of the gametes in such cases exist, and it is likely that 
by choosing suitable crosses all sorts of conditions may be found, 
ranging from the simplest case of total segregation, in which there aro 
only two forms of gametes, up to those in which there are all inter- 
mediates in various proportions. This at least is what general experi- 
ence of hybrid products leads me to anticipate. Segregation is 
somehow effected by the rhythms of cell-division, if such an expression 
may be permitted. In some cases the whole factor is so easily separated 
that it is swept out at once ; in others it is so intermixed that gametes of 
all degrees of purity may result. That is admittedly a crude metaphor, 
but as yet we cannot substitute a better. Be all this as it may, there are 
many signs that in human heredity phenomena of this kind are common, 
whether they indicate a multiplicity of cumulative factors or imper- 
fections in segregation. Such phenomena, however, in no way detract 
from the essential truths that segregation occurs, and that the organism 
cannot pass on a factor which it has not itself received. 

In human heredity we have found some examples, and I believe 
that we shall find many more, in which the descent of factors is limited 
by sex. The classical instances are those of colour-blindness and 
h£emophilia. Both these conditions occur with much gi-eater frequency 
in males than in females. Of colour-blindness at least we know that 
the sons of the colour-blind man do not inherit it (unless the mother 
is a transmitter) and do not transmit it to their children of either 
sex. Some, probably all, of the daughters of the colour-blind father 
inherit the character, and though not themselves colour-blind, they 
transmit it to some (probably, on an average, half) of their offspring 
of both sexes. For since these normal-sighted women have only 
received the colour-blindness from one side of their parentage, only 
half their offspring, on an average, can inherit it. The sons who 
inherit the colour-blindness will be colour-blind, and the inheriting 
daughters become themselves again transmitters. Males with 
normal colour- vision, whatever their own parentage, do not have colour- 
blind descendants, unless they marry transmitting women. There 
are points still doubtful in the interpretation, but the critical fact is 
clear, that the germ-cells of the colour-blind man are of two kinds: 
(i) those which do not carry on the affection and are destined to take 
part in the fonnation of sons ; and (ii) those which do caiTy on the 
colour-blindness and are destined to form daughters. There is evidence 
that the ova also are similarly predestined to form one or other of the 
sexes, but to discuss the whole question of sex-determination is beyond 
my present scope. The descent of these sex-limited affections never-

theless calls for mention here, because it is an admirable illustration of 
factorial predestination. It moreover exemplifies that parental polarity 
of the zygote to wliich I alluded in my first Address, a phenomenon 
which we suspect to be at the bottom of various anomalies of heredity, 
and suggests that there may be truth in the popular notion that in 
some respects sons resemble their mothers and daughters their fathers. 

As to the descent of hereditary diseases and malformations, however, 
we have abundant data for deciding that many are transmitted as 
dominants and a few as recessives. The most remarkable collection 
of these data is to be found in family histories of diseases of the eye. 
Neurology and dermatology have also contributed many very instructive 
pedigrees. In great measure the ophthalmological material was 
collected by Edward Nettleship, for whose death we so lately grieved. 
After retiring from practice as an oculist he devoted several years to 
this most laborious task. He was not content with hearsay evidence, 
but travelled incessantly, personally examining all accessible members 
of the families concerned, working in such a way that his pedigrees 
are models of orderly observation and recording. His zeal stimulated 
many younger men to take part in the work, and it will now go on, 
with the result that the systems of descent of all the common hereditary 
diseases of the eye will soon be known with approximate accuracy. 

Give a little imagination to considering the chief deduction from 
this work. Technical details apart, and gi'anting that we cannot 
wholly interpret the numerical results, sometimes noticeably more and 
sometimes fewer descendants of these patients being affected than 
Mendelian formulae would indicate, the expectation is that in the case 
of many diseases of the eye a large proportion of the children, grand- 
children, and remoter descendants of the patients will be affected with 
the disease. Sometimes it is only defective sight that is transmitted; 
in other cases it is blindness, either from birth or coming on at some 
later age. The most striking example perhaps is that of a foiTn of 
night-blindness still prevalent in a district near Montpellier, which 
has affected at least 130 persons, all descending from a single affected 
individual * who came into the country in the seventeenth century. 
The transmission is in every case through an affected parent, and no 
normal has been known to pass on the condition. Such an example 
well serves to illustrate the fixity of the rules of descent. Similar 
instances might be recited relating to a great variety of other conditions, 
some trivial, others grave. 

' The first human descent proved to follow Mendelian rules was that of a 
serious malformation of tKe hand studied by Farabee in America. Drinkwater 
subsequently worked out pedigrees for the same malformation in England. After 
many attempts, he now tells me that he has succeeded in proving that the 
American family and one of h'is own had an abnormal ancestor in common, five 
generations ago.

president's address. 27 

At various times it has been declared that men are born equal, and 
that the inequality is brought about by unequal opportunities. 
Acquaintance with the pedigrees ol disease soon shows the fatuity of 
such fancies. The same conclusion, we may be sure, would result 
from the true representation of the descent of any human faculty. 
Never sinca Galton's publications can the matter have been in any 
doubt. At the time he began to study family histories even the broad 
significance of heredity was frequently denied, and resemblances to 
parents or ancestors were looked on as interesting curiosities. 
Inveighing against hereditary political institutions, Tom Paine remarks 
that the idea is as absurd as that of an ' hereditary wise man,' or an 
' hereditary mathematician,' and to this day I suppose many people are 
not aware that he is saying anything more than commonly foolish. 
"We, on the contrary, would feel it something of a puzzle if two parents, 
both mathematically gifted, had any children not mathematicians. 
Galton first demonstrated the overwhelming importance of these con- 
siderations, and had he not been misled, partly by the theory of 
pangenesis, but more by his mathematical instincts and training, which 
prompted him to apply statistical treatment rather than qualitative 
analysis, he might, not improbably, have discovered the essential facts 
of Mendelism. 

It happens rarely that science has anything to offer to the common 
stock of ideas at once so comprehensive and so simple that the courses 
of our thoughts are changed. Contributions to the material progress 
of mankind are comparatively frequent. They result at once in 
application. Transit is quickened; communication is made easier; the 
food-supply is increased and population multiphed. By direct applica- 
tion to the breeding of animals and plants such results must even 
flow from Mendel's work. But I imagine the greatest practical change 
likely to ensue from modern genetic discovery will be a quickening of 
interest in the true nature of man and in the biology of races. I have 
spoken cautiously as to the evidence for the operation of any simple 
Mendelian system in the descent of human faculty; yet the certainty 
that systems which differ from the simpler schemes only in degree of 
complexity are at work in the distribution of characters among the 
human population cannot fail to influence our conceptions of life and 
of ethics, leading perhaps ultimately to modification of social usage. 
That change cannot but be in the mam one of simplification. The 
eighteenth century made great pretence of a return to nature, but it 
did not occur to those philosophers first to inquire what nature is; 
and perhaps not even the patristic wi-itings contain fantasies much 
further from physiological tinith than those which the rationalists of 
the ' Encyclopaedia ' adopted as the basis of their social schemes. For 
men are so far from being born equal or similar that to the naturalist 



28 president's address. 

they stand as the very type of a polymorphic species. Even most of 
our local races consist of many distinct strains and individual types. 
From the population of any ordinary English town as many distinct 
human breeds could in a few generations be isolated as there are now 
breeds of dogs, and indeed such a population in its present state is 
much what the dogs of Europe would be in ten years' time but for the 
interference of the fanciers. Even as at present constituted, owing 
to the isolating effects of instinct, fashion, occupation, and social class, 
many incipient strains already exist. 

In one respect civilised man differs from all other species of animal 
or plant in that, having prodigious and ever-increasing power over 
nature, he invokes these powers for the preservation and maintenance 
of many of the inferior and all the defective members of his species. 
The inferior freely multiply, and the defective, if their defects be not 
so grave as to lead to their detention in prisons or asylums, multiply 
also without restraint. Heredity being strict in its action, the conse- 
quences are in civilised countries much what they would be in the 
kennels of the dog-breeder who continued to preserve all his puppies, 
good and bad : the proportion of defectives increases. The increase is 
so considerable that outside every great city there is a smaller town 
inhabited by defectives and those who wait on them. Eound London 
we have a ring of such towns with some 30,000 inhabitants, of whom 
about 28,000 are defective, largely, though of course by no means 
entirely, bred from previous generations of defectives. Now, it is not 
for us to consider practical measures. As men of science we observe 
natural events and deduce conclusions from them. I may perhaps be 
allowed to say that the remedies proposed in America, in so far as they 
aim at the eugenic regulation of marriage on a comprehensive scale, 
strike me as devised without regard to the needs either of individuals 
or of a modern State. Undoubtedly if they decide to breed their 
population of one uniform puritan grey, they can do it in a few 
generations; but I doubt if timid respectability will make a nation 
happy, and I am sure that qualities of a different sort are needed if it 
is to compete with more vigorous and more varied communities. 
Everyone must have a preliminary sympathy with the aims of eugenists 
both abroad and at home. Their efforts at the least are doing some- 
thing to discover and spread truth as to the physiological structure of 
society. The spirit of such organisations, however, almost of 
necessity suffers from a bias towards the accepted and the ordinary, 
and if they had power it would go hard with many ingredients of 
Society that could be ill-spared. I notice an ominous passage in which 
even Galton, the founder of eugenics, feeling perhaps some twinge of 
his Quaker ancestry, remarks that ' as the Bohemianism in the nature 
of our race is destined to perish, the sooner it goes, the happier for 



president's address. 29 

mankind. ' It is not the eugenists who will give us what Plato has called 
divine releases from the common ways. If some fancier with the 
catholicity of Shakespeare would take us in hand, well and good ; but 
I would not trust even Shakespeares meeting as a committee. Let us 
remember that Beethoven's father was an habitual drunkard and that 
his mother died of consumption. From the genealogy of the patriarchs 
also we learn — what may very well be the truth — that the fathers of 
such as dwell in tents, and of all such as handle the harp or organ, 
and the instructor of every artificer in brass and iron — the founders, 
that is to say, of the arts and the sciences— came in direct descent 
from Cain, and not in the posterity of the irreproachable Seth, who 
is to us, as he probably was also in the narrow circle of his own 
contemporaries, what naturalists call a nomen midtcm. 

Genetic research will make it possible for a nation to elect by what 
sort of beings it will be represented not very many generations hence, 
much as a farmer can decide whether his byres 'shall be full of short- 
horns or Herefords. It will be very surprising indeed if some nation 
does not make trial of this new power. They may make awful mis- 
takes, but I think they will try. 

Whether we like it or not, extraordinary and far-reaching changes in 
public opinion are coming to pass. Man is just beginning to know 
himself for what he is — a rather long-lived animal, with great powers 
of enjoyment if he does not deliberately forgo them. Hitherto 
superstition and mythical ideas of sin have predominantly controlled 
these powers. Mysticism will not die out: for those strange fancies 
knowledge is no cure; but their forms may change, and mysticism as 
a force for the suppression of joy is happily losing its hold on the 
modem world. As in the decay of earlier religions Ushabti dolls 
were substituted for human victims, so telepathy, necromancy, and 
other harmless toys take the place of eschatology and the inculcation 
of a ferocious moral code. Among the civilised races of Europe we 
are witnessing an emancipation from traditional control in thought, in 
art, and in conduct which is likely to have prolonged and wonderful 
influences. Eeturning to freer or, if you will, simpler conceptions of 
life and death, the coming generations are determined to get more out 
of this world than their forefathers did. Is it then to be supposed 
that when science puts into their hand means for the alleviation of 
suffering immeasurable, and for making this world a happier place, 
that they will demur to using those powers? The intenser struggle 
between communities is only now beginning, and with the approach- 
ing exhaustion of that capital of energy stored in the earth before man 
began it must soon become still more fierce. In England some of our 
great-grandchildren will see the end of the easily accessible coal, and, 
failing some miraculous discovery of available energy, a wholesale 



30 president's address. 

reduction in population. There are races who have shown themselves 
able at a word to throw off all tradition and take into their service 
every power that science has yet offered them. Can we expect that 
they, when they see how to rid themselves of the ever-increasing 
weight of a defective population, will hesitate? The time cannot be 
far distant when both individuals and communities will begin to 
think in terms of biological fact, and it behoves those who lead 
scientific thought carefully to consider whither action should lead. 
At present I ask you merely to observe the facts. The powers of 
science to preserve the defective are now enormous. Every year 
these powers increase. This course of action must reach a limit. 
To the deliberate intervention of civilisation for the preservation of in- 
ferior strains there must sooner or later come an end, and before long 
nations will realise the responsibility they have assumed in multiplying 
these ' cankers of a calm world and a long peace. ' 

The definitely feeble-minded we may with propriety restrain, as 
we are beginning to do even in England, and we may safely prevent 
unions in which both parties ai'e defective, for the evidence shows 
that as a inile such marriages, though often prolific, commonly produce 
no normal children at all. The union of such social vermin we should 
no more pennit than we would allow parasites to breed on our own 
bodies. Further than that in restraint of marriage we ought not to 
go, at least not yet. Something too may be done by a reform of 
medical ethics. Medical students are taught that it is their duty to 
prolong life at whatever cost in suffering. This may have been right 
when diagnosis was uncertain and interference usually of small effect; 
but deliberately to interfere now for the preservation of an infant so 
gravely diseased that it can never be happy or come fo any good is 
very like wanton cruelty. In private few men defend such inter- 
ference. Most who have seen these cases lingering on agree that 
the system is deplorable, but ask where can any line be drawn. The 
biologist would reply that in all ages such decisions have been made by 
civilised communities with fair success both in regard to crime and 
in the closely analogous case of lunacy. The real reason why these 
things are done is because the world collectively cherishes occult 
views of the nature of life, because the facts are realised by few, and 
because between the legal mind — ^to which society has become accus- 
tomed to defer — and the seeing eye, there is such physiological 
antithesis that hardly can they be combined in the same body. So 
soon as scientific knowledge becomes common property, views more 
reasonable and, I may add, more humane, are likely to prevail. 

To all these great biological problems that modern society must 
sooner or later face there are many aspects besides the obvious ones. 
Infant mortality we are asked to lament without the slightest thought 



president's address. 81 

of what the world would be hke if the majority of these infants 
were to survive. The decline in the birth-rate in countries already 
over-populated is often deplored, and we are told that a nation in 
which populatpon is not rapidly increasing must be in a decline. The 
slightest acquaintance with biology, or even school-boy natural history, 
shows that this inference may be entirely wrong, and that before such 
a question can be decided in one way or the other, hosts of considera- 
tions must be taken into account. In normal stable conditions 
population is stationary. The laity never appreciates, what is so clear 
to a biologist, that the last century and a quarter, corresponding with 
the great rise in population, has been an altogether exceptional period.' 
To our species this period has been what its early years in Australia 
were to the rabbit. The exploitation of energy-capital of the earth in 
coal, development of the new countries, and the consequent poui'ing 
of food into Europe, the application of antiseptics, these are the things 
that have enabled the human population to increase. I do not doubt 
that if population were more evenly spread over the earth it might 
increase very much more; but the essential fact is that under any 
stable conditions a limit must be reached. A pair of wrens will bring 
off a dozen young every year, but each year you will find the same 
number of pears in your garden. In England the limit beyond which 
under present conditions of distribution increase of population is a 
source of suffering rather than of happiness has been reached already. 
Younger communities living in territories largely vacant are very 
probably right in desiring and encouraging more population. Increase 
may, for some temporary reason, be essential to their prosperity. But 
those who live, as I do, among thousands of creatures in a state of 
semi-starvation will realise that too few is better than too many, and 
will acknowledge the wisdom of Ecclesiasticus who said ' Desire not a 
multitude of unprofitable children.' 

But at least it is often urged that the decline in the birth-rate of 
the intelligent and successful sections of the population — I am speaking 
of the older communities — is to be regretted. Even this cannot be 
granted without qualification. As the biologist knows, differentiation 
is indispensable to progress. If population were homogeneous civilisa- 
tion would stop. In every army the officers must be comparatively 
few. Consequently, if the upper strata of the community produce 
more children than will recruit their numbers some must fall into the 
lower strata and increase the pressure there. Statisticians tell us that 
an average of four children under present conditions is sufl&amp;cient to 
keep the number constant, and as the expectation of life is steadily 
improving we may perhaps contemplate some diminution of that number 
without alarm. 



32 president's address. 

In the study of history biological treatment is only beginning to be 
applied. For us the causes of the success and failure of races are 
physiological events, and the progress of man has depended upon a 
chain of these events, like those which have resulted in the ' improve- 
ment ' of the domesticated animals and plants. It is obvious, for 
example, that had the cereals never been domesticated cities could 
scarcely have existed. But we may go further, and say that in tem- 
perate countries of the Old World (having neither rice nor maize) 
populations concentrated in large cities have been made possible by 
the appearance of a ' thrashable ' wheat. The ears of the wild wheats 
break easily to pieces, and the grain remains in the thick husk. Such 
wheat can be used for food, but not readily. Ages before written 
history began, in some unknown place, plants, or more likely a plant, 
of wheat lost the dominant factor to which this brittleness is due, and 
tlie recessive, thrashable wheat resulted. Some man noticed this 
wonderful novelty, and it has been disseminated over the earth. The ori- 
ginal variation may well have occurred once only, in a single genn-cell. 

So must it have been with Man. Translated into terms of factors, 
how has that progress in control of nature which we call civilisation 
been achieved? By the sporadic appearance of variations, mostly, per- 
haps all, consisting in a loss of elements, which inhibit the free 
working of the mind. The members of civilised communities, when 
they think about such things at all, imagine the process a gradual one, 
and that they themselves are active agents in it. Few, however, contri- 
bute anything but their labour; and except in so far as they have 
freedom to adopt and imitate, their physiological composition is that 
of an earlier order of beings. Annul the work of a few hundreds — 
I might almost say scores — of men, and on what plane of civilisation 
should we be? We should not have advanced beyond the mediaeval 
stage without printing, chemistry, steam, electricity, or surgery worthy 
the name. These things are the contributions of a few excessively rare 
minds. Gal ton reckoned those to whom the term ' illustrious ' might 
be applied as one in a million, but in that number he is, of course, 
reckoning men famous in ways which add nothing to universal pi'ogress. 
To improve by subordinate invention, to discover details missed, even 
to apply knowledge never before applied, all these things need genius 
in some degree, and are far beyond the powers of the average man of 
our race; but the true pioneer, the man whose penetration creates a 
new world, as did that of Newton and of Pasteur, is inconceivably 
rare. But for a few thousands of such men, we should perhaps be in 
the Palaeolithic era, knowing neither metals, writing, arithmetic, 
weaving, nor pottery. 

In the history of Art the same is true, but with this remarkable 
difference, that not only are gifts of artistic creation very rare, but 



president's address. 33 

even the faculty of artistic enjoyment, not to speak of higher powers 
of appreciation, is not attained without variation from the common 
type. I am speaking, of course, of the non-Semitic races of modern 
Europe, among whom tlie power whether of making or enjoying works 
of art is confined to an insignificant number of individuals. Apprecia- 
tion can in some degree be simulated, but in our population there is 
no widespread physiological appetite for such things. When detached 
from the centres where they are made by others most of us pass our 
time in great contentment, making nothing that is beautiful, and quite 
unconscious of any deprivation. Musical taste is the most notable 
exception, for in certain races — for example, the Welsh and some 
of the Germans — it is almost universal. Otherwise artistic faculty is 
still sporadic in its occurrence. The cost of music well illustrates the 
application of genetic analysis to human faculty. No one disputes 
that musical ability is congenital. In its fuller manifestation it 
demands sense of rhythm, ear, and special nervous . and muscular 
powers. Each of these is separable and doubtless genetically distinct. 
Each is the consequence of a special departure from the common type. 
Teaching and external influences are powerless to evoke these faculties, 
though their development may be assisted. The only conceivable 
way in which the people of England, for example, oould become a 
musical nation would be by the gradual rise in the proportional numbers 
of a musical strain or strains until the present type became so rare 
as to be negligible. It by no means follows that in any other respect 
the resulting population would be distinguishable from the present one. 
Difficulties of this kind beset the efforts of anthropologists to trace 
racial origins. It nm&amp;t continually be remembered that most characters 
are independently transmitted and capable of such recombination. In 
the light of Mendelian knowledge the discussion whether a race is pure 
or mixed loses almost all significance. A race is pure if it breeds pure 
and not otherwise. Historically we may know that a race like our 
own was, as a matter of fact, of mixed origin. But a character may 
have been introduced by a single individual, though subsequently it 
becomes common to the race. This is merely a variant on the familiar 
paradox that in the course of time if registration is accurate we shall 
all have the same surname. In the case of music, for instance, the 
gift, originally perhaps from a Welsh source, might permeate the 
nation, and the question would then arise whether the nation, so 
changed, was the English nation or not. 

Such a problem is raised in a striking form by the population of 
modern Greece, and especially of Athens. The racial characteristics 
of the Athenian of the fifth century B.C. are vividly described by 
Galton in 'Hereditary Genius.' The fact that in that period a 
population, numbering many thousands, should have existed, capable

of following the great plays at a first hearing, revelling in subtleties of 
speech, and thrilling with passionate delight in beautiful things, is 
physiologically a most singular phenomenon. On the basis of the 
number of illustrious men produced by that age Galton estimated the 
average intelligence as at least two of his degrees above our own, 
differing from us as much as we do from the negro. A few generations 
later the display was over. The origin of that constellation of human 
genius which then blazed out is as yet beyond all biological analysis, but 
I think we are not altogether without suspicion of the sequence of the 
biological events. If I visit a poultry-breeder who has a fine stock of 
thoroughbred game fowls breeding true, and ten years later — that is to 
say ten fowl-generations later — I go again and find scarcely a recognis- 
able game-fowl on the place, I know exactly what has happened. One 
or two birds of some other or of no breed must have strayed in and 
their progeny been left undestroyed. Now in Athens we have many 
indications that up to the beginning of the fifth century so long 
as the phratries and gentes were maintained in their integrity there 
was rather close endogamy, a condition giving the best chance of 
producing a homogeneous population. There was no lack of material 
from which intelligence and artistic power might be derived. Sporadi- 
cally these qualities existed throughout the ancient Greek world from 
the dawn of history, and, for example, the vase-painters, the makers 
of the Tanagra figurines, and the gem-cutters were presumably pur- 
suing family crafts, much as are the actor-families'* of England or 
the professorial families of Germany at the present day. How the 
intellectual strains should have acquired predominance we cannot tell, 
but in an in-breeding community homogeneity at least is not surprising. 
At the end of the sixth century came the ' reforms ' of Cleisthenes 
(507 B.C.), which sanctioned foreign marriages and admitted to citizen- 
ship a number not only of resident aliens but also of manumitted 
slaves. As Aristotle says, Cleisthenes legislated with the deliberate 
purpose of breaking up the phratries and gentes, in order that the 
various sections of the population might be mixed up as much as 
possible, and the old tribal associations abolished. The ' reform ' was 
probably a recognition and extension of a process already begun; but 
is it too much to suppose that we have here the effective beginning 
of a series of genetic changes which in a few generations so greatly 
altered the character of the people? Under Pericles the old law was 
restored (451 B.C.), but losses in the great wars led to further laxity in 
practice, and though at the end of the fifth century the strict rule 
was re-enacted that a citizen must be of citizen-birth on both sides, 
the population by that time may well have become largely mongrelised. 
Let me not be construed as arguing that mixture of races is an

evil : far from it. A population like our own, indeed, owes much of 
its strength to the extreme diversity of its components, for they con- 
tribute a corresponding abundance of aptitudes. Everything turns on 
the nature of the ingredients brought in, and I am concerned solely 
with the observation that these genetic disturbances lead ultimately 
to great and usually unforeseen changes in the nature of the population. 

Some experiments of this kind are going on at the present time, 
in the United States, for example, on a very large scale. Our grand- 
children may live to see the characteristics of the American population 
entirely altered by the vast invasion of Italian and other South 
European elements. We may expect that the Eastern States, and 
especially New England, whose people still exhibit the fine Puritan 
qualities with their appropriate limitations, absorbing little of the 
alien elements, will before long be in feelings and aptitudes very notably 
differentiated from the rest. In Japan, also, with the abolition of the 
feudal system and the rise of commercialism, a change in population 
has begun which may be worthy of the attention of naturalists in that 
country. Till the revolution the Samurai almost always married within 
their own class, with the result, as I am informed, that the caste had 
fairly recognisable features. The changes of 1868 and the consequent 
impoverishment of the Samurai have brought about a beginning of 
disintegration which may not improbably have perceptible effects. 

How many genetic vicissitudes has our own peerage undergone! 
Into the hard-fighting stock of mediaeval and Plantagenet times have 
successively been crossed the cunning shrewdness of Tudor states- 
men and courtiers, the numerous contributions of Charles II. and 
his concubines, reinforcing ipeculiar and persistent attributes which 
popular imagination especially regards as the characteristic of peers, 
ultimately the heroes of finance and industrialism. Definitely intellec- 
tual elements have been sporadically added, with rare exceptions, 
however, from the ranks of lawyers and politicians. To this 
aristocracy art, learning, and science have contributed sparse in- 
gredients, but these mostly chosen for celibacy or childlessness. A 
remarkable body of men, nevertheless ; with an average ' horse-power, ' 
as Samuel Butler would have said, far exceeding that of any random 
sample of the middle-class. If only man could be reproduced by 
budding what a simplification it would be ! In vegetative reproduction 
heredity is usually complete. The Washington plum can be divided 
to produce as many identical individuals as are required. If, say, 
Washington, the statesman, or preferably King Solomon, could 
similarly have been propagated, all the nations of the earth could 
have been supplied with ideal rulers. 

HistorianG commonly ascribe such changes as occurred in Athens, 
and will almost certainly come to pass in the United States, to 

l&gt; 2 



36 president's address. 

conditions of life and especially to political institutions. These agencies, 
however, do little unless they are such as to change the breed. 
External changes may indeed give an opportunity to special strains, 
which then acquire ascendency. The industrial developments which 
began at the end of the eighteenth century, for instance, gave a chance 
to strains till then submerged, and their success involved the decay 
of most of the old aristocratic families. But the demagogue who 
would argue from the rise of the one and the fall of the other that 
the original relative positions were not justifiable altogether mistakes the 
facts. 

Conditions give opportunities but cause no variations. For example, 
in Athens, to which I just referred, the universality of cultivated dis- 
cernment could never have come to pass but for the institution of 
slavery which provided the opportunity, but slavery was in no sense a 
cause of that development, for many other populations have lived on 
slaves and remained altogether inconspicuous. 

The long-standing controversy as to the relative importance of nature 
and nurture, to use Galton's ' convenient jingle of words,' is drawing 
to an end, and of the overwhelmingly greater significance of nature 
there is no longer any possibility of doubt. It may be well briefly to 
recapitulate the arguments on which naturalists rely in coming to 
this decision both as regards races and individuals. First as regards 
human individuals, there is the common experience that children 
of the same parents reared under conditions sensibly identical may 
develop quite differently, exhibiting in character and aptitudes a 
segregation just as great as in their colours or hair-forms. Conversely 
all the more marked aptitudes have at various times appeared and not 
rarely reached perfection in circumstances the least favourable for 
their development. Next, appeal can be made to the universal experi- 
ence of the breeder, whether of animals or plants, that strain is 
absolutely essential, that though bad conditions may easily enough 
spoil a good strain, yet that under the best conditions a bad strain 
will never give a fine result. It is faith, not evidence, which encourages 
educationists and economists to hope so greatly in the ameliorating 
effects of the conditions of life. Let us consider what they can do 
and what they cannot. By reference to some sentences in a charming 
though pathetic book, ' What Is, and What Might Be,' by Mr. Edmond 
Holmes, which will be well known in the Educational Section, I may 
make the point of view of us naturalists clear. I take Mr. Holmes's 
pronouncement partly because he is an enthusiastic believer in the 
efficacy of nurture as opposed to nature, and also because he illus- 
trates his views by frequent appeals to biological analogies which help 
us to a common ground. Wheat badly cultivated will give a bad yield, 
though, as Mr. Holmes truly says, wheat of the same strain in similar 



president's address. 37 

soil well cultivated may give a good harvest. But, having witnessed 
the success of a great natural teacher in helping unpromising peasant 
children to develop their natural powers, he gives us another botanical 
parallel. Assuming that the wild buUace is the origin of domesticated 
plums, he tells us that by cultivation the buUace can no doubt be 
improved so far as to become a better bullace, but by no means can 
the bullace be made to bear plums. All this is sound biology; but 
translating these facts into the human analogy, he declares that the 
work of the successful teacher shows that with man the facts are other- 
wise, and that the average rustic child, whose normal ideal is ' bullace- 
hood,' can become the rare exception, developing to a stage corre- 
sponding with that of the plum. But the naturalist knows exactly 
where the parallel is at fault. For the wheat and the bullace are 
both breeding approximately true, whereas the human crop, like jute 
and various cottons, is in a state of polymorphic mixture. The popula- 
tion of many English villages may be compared with the crop which 
would result from sowing a bushel of kernels gathered mostly from the 
hedges, with an occasional few from an orchard. If anyone asks 
how it happens that there are any plum-kernels in the sample at all, 
he may find the answer perhaps in spontaneous variation, but more 
probably in the appearance of a long-hidden recessive. For the want 
of that genetic variation, consisting probably, as I have argued, in 
loss of inhibiting factors, by which the plum arose from the wild form, 
neither food, nor education, nor hygiene can in any way atone. Many 
wild plants are half -starved through competition, and transferred to 
garden soil they grow much bigger; so good conditions might certainly 
enable the bullace population to develop beyond the stunted physical and 
mental stature they commonly attain, but plums they can never be. 
Modern statesmanship aims rightly at helping those who have got sown 
as wildings to come into their proper class ; but let not anyone suppose 
such a policy democratic in its ultimate effects, for no course of 
action can be more effective in strengthening the upper classes whilst 
weakening the lower. 

In all practical schemes for social reform the congenital diversity, 
the essential polymorphism of all civilised communities must be recog- 
nised as a fundamental fact, and reformers should rather direct their 
efforts to facilitating and rectifying class-distinctions than to any futile 
attempt to abolish them. The teaching of biology is perfectly clear. 
We are what we are by virtue of our differentiation. The value of 
civilisation has in all ages been doubted. Since, however, the first 
variations were not strangled in their birth, we are launched on that 
course of variability of which civilisation is the consequence. We can- 
not go back to homogeneity again, and differentiated we are likely 
to continue. For a period measures designed to create a spurious 



38 president's address. 

homogeneity may be applied. Such attempts will, I anticipate, be made 
when the present unstable social state reaches a climax of instability, 
which may not be long hence. Their effects can be but evanescent. 
The instability is due not to inequality, which is inherent and congenital, 
but rather to the fact that in periods of rapid change like the present, 
convection-currents are set up such that the elements of the strata 
get intermixed and the apparent stratification corresponds only roughly 
with the genetic. In a few generations under uniform conditions these 
elements settle in their true levels once more. 

In such equilibrium is content most surely to be expected. To the 
naturalist the broad lines of solution of the problems of social dis- 
content are evident. They lie neither in vain dreams of a mystical and 
disintegrating equality, nor in the promotion of that malignant indi- 
vidualism which in older civilisations has threatened mortification of 
the humbler organs, but rather in a physiological co-ordination of the 
constituent parts of the social organism. The rewards of commerce 
are grossly out of proportion to those attainable by intellect or industry. 
Even regarded as compensation for a dull life^ they far exceed the 
value of the services rendered to the community. Such disparity is an 
incident of the abnormally rapid growth of population and is quite 
indefensible as a permanent social condition. Nevertheless capital, 
distinguished as a provision for offspring, is a eugenic institution; and 
unless human instinct undergoes some ptx)found and improbable 
variation, abolition of capital means the abolition of effort; but as in 
the body the power of independent growth of the parts is limited and 
subordinated to the whole, similarly in the community we may limit the 
powers of capital, preserving so much inequality of privilege as 
corresponds with physiological fact. 

At every turn the student of political science is confronted with 
problems that demand biological knoi' ledge for their solution. Most 
obviously is this true in regard to education, the criminal law, and 
all those numerous branches of policy and administration which are 
directly concerned with the physiological capacities of mankind. 
Assumptions as to what can be done and what cannot be done to 
modify individuals and races have continually to be made, and the 
basis of fact on which such decisions are founded can be drawn only 
from biological study. 

A knowledge of the facts of nature is not yet deemed an essential 
part of the mental equipment of politicians ; but as the priest, who 
began in other ages as medicine-man, has been obliged to abandon 
the medical parts of his practice, so will the future behold the school- 
master, the magistrate, the lawyer, and ultimately the statesman, 
compelled to share with the naturalist those functions which are 
concerned with the physiology of race.

I. — General Notes. 

The Committee asks to be reappointed with a grant of 60L 

The death of John Milne, in July 1913, creates a situation of 
some difficulty and anxiety. He organised a world-wide seismological 
service with very little financial help from others. In many of the 
outlying stations the instnimental equipment was provided either by 
himself or by one of his friends, and the care of it has been gener- 
ously undertaken by a volunteer who is often busily engaged in other 
work. The collation of results was in the early years undertaken by 
Milne himself, with the able help of Shinobu Hirota. Of late years 
a subsidy of 200L a year from the Government Grant Fund allowed 
of paid assistants; and Shinobu Hirota thus obtained a well-deserved 
official position; but for many years the only salary he received was 
paid from Milne's own pocket. It is by no means certain that tbe 
volunteer services at the stations, and the subsidy from the Govern- 
ment Grant Fund which makes it possible to keep running the 
central station at Shide, can be long continued; and it seems in 
any case very improbable that they can be rendered permanent. 
But a much more serious difficulty is the want of a salary for a 
Director or Superintendent of the whole British network of stations, 
who can give undivided attention to the valuable results which they 
have accumulated and to which they are daily adding. The salary of

a competent Director, with the requisite mathematical knowledge, 
cannot be put lower than 500L or 6001. a year, and there is at 
present no prospect of obtaining even this endowment. The super- 
intendence has, of course, been hitherto provided voluntarily by Milne 
himself; and a certain amount of volunteer attention is available for 
the present. But seismology is developing so rapidly that the whole- 
hearted attention of at least one English mathematician should be 
devoted to it; and if an endowment for a British Director could be 
obtained this would surely be the most direct method of doing 
justice to a new and fascinating science which was nurtured by an 
Englishman. The negative result of previous appeals to the Govern- 
ment does not encourage the hope of their taking any action, and 
the chief hope thus lies in the direction of private benefaction. 
Is it too much to hope that some generous benefactor will provide a 
firm footing for seismology ? 

The present state of affairs is as follows: — The Shide Observatory 
is rented from Mrs. Milne at 20L a year. The work of the Shide 
station and the collation of results from other stations is being 
done by Mr. J. H. Burgess, who assisted Professor Milne in' the later 
years of his life, especially after the return of Shinobu Hirota to 
Japan. At the time of Professor Milne's death the work of collation 
was in arrear; and in order to bring it up to date assistance is 
being temporarily rendered by Mr. S. W. Pring (who had already 
considerable knowledge of the work) and his daughter. The general 
superintendence is undertaken by the Chairman of this Committee, 
partly by correspondence and partly by personal visits to Shide (on 
September 20-21, January 17-20, March 29-April 2, and May 9-11). 

Registers. Card Catalogue System. Monthly Bulletins. — The 
form of the Circulars has been changed. Up to the present the in- 
formation supplied by each individual station has been printed separ- 
ately, thus leaving the formal collation of results to others. But 
since a good deal of collation was actually done at Shide in order 
to eliminntfi accidental tremors from the records, it seemed desirable 
to render this work generally available at the cost of a slight 
extension. The collation was foraierly done in a large book with 
ruled columns, one double page being devoted to each month. In 
place of this a card catalogue system has been adopted. The 
information supplied by the stations is copied on to cards, a separate 
card for each day. A cabinet of twelve drawers (one for each calendar 
month) has been made, each drawer divided into 32 partitions (4 x 8) 
corresponding to the days of the month (with 1 — 4 over), and the 
cards are slipped into the proper partition as they are copied off. 
When all the records have been received for the month (and the 
stations have been asked kindly to send their records each month) it 
is easily seen by comparison of the different cards in any partition 
which are the important quakes and which are microseisms or 
accidental tremors. For the first few months of 1913 details wei'e 
printed for all disturbances recorded at moi'e than four stations; but 
experience quickly showed that much of this information was of

comparatively little value, the records for small quakes being liable 
to errors of various kinds; and from April 1913 onwards a chart 
has been printed showing merely that such and such a quake has 
been observed at a particular station without further details, except 
in the case of a really large earthquake. It is, of course, difficult to 
draw a satisfactory line between large earthquakes and small, but a 
practical procedure was based on the following figures given in the 
April Bulletin : —

According to this table, if attention is confined to those earthquakes 
recorded at thirty-one stations at least, we should get a hundred of 
them in a year; and it was thought sufficient to give full details for 
these. It should be remarked that the stations are no longer Milne 
stations only — the list has been extended to include all those stations 
which send their records to Shide; and it is hoped that this compre- 
hensive collation of results will be found useful. Undoubtedly a 
comparison with tabular theoretical results would increase its useful- 
ness, and it is hoped to undertake such a comparison from January 
1914; but to attempt this for 1913 would have seriously delayed 
publication (already considerably in arrear), and indeed was scarcely 
possible until a tentative discussion such as is given later in the present 
Eeport had been carried out. 

Notation. — One other change will be made in January 1914. The 
symbols Pj, Po, P3, &amp;c., were introduced by Milne, and have been 
used by him throughout his work, althouigh he assented to the change 
to P, S, L, &amp;c., as determined at the Manchester Meeting, 1911, of 
the International Seismological Association. It seemed only a proper 
mark of respect to complete the year of Milne's death (1913) in his 
notation ; but the change to the adopted system will be made from the 
beginning of 1914. 

Visitors. — ^The station at Shide continues to attract a number of 
visitors, many of them with only a limited knowledge of seismology; 
iheir visits naturally make inroads on the time of the assistant-in- 
charge, but it seems undesirable to discourage them at the present 
juncture. The visits of seismologists have naturally been affected by 
Milne's death; and in the consequent disorganisation the visitors' book 
was for a time not regularly posted; but we have had the pleasure 
of seeing at Shide Mr. J. J. Shaw of West Bromwich, Mr. E. F. 
Norris of Guildford, Mr. J. Pound and Mr. S. B. Round of 



44 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 

Birmingham, Mr. L. F. Eichardson of Eskdalemuir, and Mr. J. E. 
Orombie of Aberdeen. 

II. — Seismic Activity in 1911. 

The visit of the British Association to Australia makes it necessary 
to have the greater part of this Eeport in proof at an earher date than 
usual. The list of origins for 1911, in continuation of those given in 
previous Eeports, is not completed at this date ; but it is hoped to add 
it at the end of the Eeport before it is finally printed off for 
distribution. 

III. — Distribution of Earthquake Centres. 

Study of the information collected by Milne in previous Eeports has 
suggested a new form of the map which he has usually printed 
showing the distribution of large earthquakes. On some of these 
maps he has shown Libbey's Circle, and on others a cycle of his 
own running through the chief earthquake centres. 

On scrutiny of the distribution of centres not thus accounted for, 
the existence of a curve of secondary disturbance was suggested, 
with the suggestive feature of enclosing most of the land on the earth's 
surface — skirting especially the Western coast of North America and 
the Eastern coast of Asia. Adjustments by trial and error of these 
two curves showed that it was not difficult to make them great cii'cles 
cutting at right angles; but not easy to make them account for all 
the striking facts. More or less by accident, the third gi'eat circle 
cutting both at right angles was di'awn, and immediately several 
striking geographical features fell into line. Further work on this 
system of three great circles suggested after many trials a system 
symmetrical with respect to the earth's axis, the points of intersection 
being at about 55° (accurately tan -i V2) from the poles; and there 
was little trouble iu fixing the approximate longitudes at 25° ± 60° n 
East. 

A system of three great circles cutting at right angles divides the 
surface of the sphere into eight equilateral right-angled triangles. If 
we project each of these on a tangent plane at its centre, we get 
an octahedron surrounding the sphere, and we can unwrap it into a 
plane in various ways. The particular plan of the accompanying map 
is adopted in order to bring out the striking symmetry, both seismo- 
logical and geogi'aphical, of the earth as thus represented, a symmetry 
only slightly disguised by the one-sidedness of the water covering. 
[We can imagine the distribution made quite symmetrical, and then 
the upper right-hand corner dipped slightly more under the water; but 
we will neglect this point for a moment.] 

Six of the triangles are easily recognised, the other two have 
been divided by their median lines in order to show the symmetry 
while keeping the figm^e compact ; but ABC and CBD could be detached 
from AC and CD, and joined along CB placed in a vertical position, 
thus keeping the symmetry at the expense of a little detachment. 

Let us consider the triangle EFK, which is chiefly Asia. India lies 
nearly on the median line, pointing to the apex of the triangle; and just

ON SEISMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS. 45 

above India Tibet, the highest land in the world, occupies nearly the 
centre of the triangle. The side KE runs through a well-known 
series of earthquake centres skirting the coast, of which perhaps the 
most important are at E (Japan) and S (Borneo), one at the extremity 
and the other near the middle point. The continuation of KE is EO, 
since the angles FEK and FEO, though they are only 60° on the 
plane projections, are 90° on the sphere; and since there is a notable 
centre U (Alaska) near the middle of EG, we may perhaps consider 
S and U as corresponding points of strain. 

The side KF is not so conspicuous a line of earthquakes at present, 
though the point F (Crete) is a familiar region, and corresponding 
to S we may take R, the middle point of FK, as representing earth- 
quakes in the Indian Ocean. But apart from modern records, the 
geographical features of this line EF, viz., the Eed Sea, the Grecian 
Archipelago, and the Adriatic, are strongly suggestive of crumpling 
into folds at some time in the past. Gontinuing the line along FC, 
there is an active centre near the middle point T which is not far 
from Iceland; so that S, E, V have corresponding points in R, F, T; 
the former are at present the stronger, but this may not have been 
always so. 

The apex G is not an earthquake centre, but near it, and sym- 
metrically disposed on the sides GD, GA, are the Galifornian and 
West Indian regions. The symmetry of the whole arrangement round 
the point V (close to Tomsk) will be complete if we may put two 
Antarctic centres at the points P and Q which are in latitude — 53° and 
longitudes 56° and 115° East. Milne assigned two Antarctic regions 
near these as a result of observations made during the voyage of the 
' Discovery ' (March 14, 1902, to November 28, 1903), but it is doubt- 
ful whether the material is sufficient to locate them exactly. 

As regards the remainder of the map, the symmetrical disposition 
of South Africa and Australia is noteworthy; but as we go northwards 
from them the symmetry disappears, the upper half of the African 
triangle being land, that of the Australian water (though much of it 
not very deep). Superposed on the arrangement symmetrical, about 
the line CK there is at least one unsymmetrical character which may 
be roughly described as a division into land and water hemispheres, 
and as such has been often noted. In the present diagram the salient 
points of this contrast are: — 

(a) Land in the triangle FGK, water in the triangle GDE. 

(b) Water in the middle of land in the triangle AGF, land in the 
middle of water in EKL. 

(c) The absence of land corresponding to South America, on the 
line GD. If a bathy-orographical map be consulted it will, however, 
be found that there is a shallow in this part of the ocean, not very 
different from South America in shape. It is conceivable that a mere 
shift of the earth's centre of gravity might uncover this ' image ' of 
South America. 

In a future Report it is hoped to show the actual distribution of 
observed earthquakes on this map; but this will take some little time.

IV. — Discussion of Resvlts from Different Seismographs. 

The card catalogue system introduced at Shide for records from 
January 1913 onwards facilitates the comparison of results from 
different instruments. The following discussion is only preliminary, and 
tJie unit of time adopted (O'l m. or 6 sec.) is not small enough to 
do justice to the best instruments. But it is as small as can reasonably 
he adopted for the Milne instruments, and the main object of the 
discussion is to bring out the comparative attainments of the Milne 
seismographs as compared with modern and much more sensitive 
apparatus. 

From the beginning of 1912, the weekly Bulletins issued from 
Pulkovo give epicentres for the large earthquakes, determined by 
Galitzin's method for a single station. Adopting these as correct 
and using the table printed by G. W.. Walker on p. 54 of his mono- 
graph on 'Modern Seismology,' or by Galitzin in his ' Vorlesungen 
iiber Seismometrie, ' p. 137, we can deduce from the times recorded at 
Pulkovo for either P or S, the time of the eartihquake itself. Re- 
applying the table we can deduce the theoretical times of arrival of 
P and S at other stations, for comparison with their records. For 
tliis purpose the distances of the stations from the epicentre were read 
to whole degrees from a globe, which again is a method unsuitable to 
refined investigation, but sufficiently accurate for the present pre- 
liminary examination. 

As an example, the times recorded for the earthquake of 1913, 
January 11, were as follows: —

The difference between the times of arrival of P and S being near 
10 m. it is possible that some of these are mistakes of P for S. But 
in the case of Czemowitz, a mistake of 10 m. in both P and S seems 
probable. It is safer to omit these cases as anomalies than to attempt 
to correct them. 

Errors. &lt;6 m. and &gt;1 m. — With the exception of a couple near 
the epicentre these do not develop until near 90°. Between 90° and 
100°, however, they outnumber the normal errors given in the body of 
the table. They are doubtless due to the fact that a reflected wave 
lias been mistaken for the direct wave. The fact that the first reflected 
effect PR is often more pronounced than P in the case of distant earth- 
quakes is duly not^d in Walker's monogi'aph (p. 41) ; it may not, how- 
ever, be realised that it is so often mistaken for P in the published 
records of sensitive instruments. Beyond 100° from the epicentre 
no times for P were coiTectly given at all for the five earthquakes 
here examined. It is not intended to ignore the fact that these differ- 
ences \vill change with distance from epicentre, but for the present 
rough review we will neglect this change. The median is 3"75 m. 
or 3 m. 45 s. The mean of the differences from this is it 0"53 m. But 
it does not seem clear that some of the differences which may be faulty 
P readings should be included. If these are excluded the median is' 
3"8 m. ; the mean is 3"87 m. ; and the mean of the differences from 
the mean is ± 0"35 m. 

Normal Errors. — Coming now to the main part of Table I., if we 
take the eiTors as they stand (assuming the time-table for P con-ect 
throughout) the mean of the 87 differences is - 0'07 m. or -4 s. 
But there is a systematic run about the differences as may be seen 
from the following means for the separate columns: —

and then the errors are distributed as in the last column. The mean 
is now +0"014: m. or +0'8 s. and the mean of the errors is ± 0'31 m., 
very close to the mean of the errors 0'35 m. obtained above for the 
reflected wave. A considerable part of this mean error may be due 
to the errors of reading distances from the epicentre, and to the error 
of assumed position of the epicentre itself. 

Large Negative Readings. — The eight negative readings are prob- 
ably due to accidental air tremors just preceding the quake; these 
call for no special remark here except that they seem to be pretty 
clearly separated off from the normal readings ; even making a generous 
allowance for accidental error in the latter. It will be seen that the 
numerically smallest (-2"3m.) is a full minute away from the out- 
side error (-l"2m.) included among possible normal readings. The 
details may be given here in case the observatories care to examine 
the records : —

It would liei-eby appear that while the tables for P are fauiy 
accurate, those for S are sensibly in error. The amount of error 
cannot be assigned more than very roughly by the present method, 
because the error for Pulkovo comes differently into the various earth- 
quakes. But it would appear that the times of arrival of S at 20° 
distance and at 100° distance from the epicentre are relatively erro- 
neous by something like a whole minute. The error is apparently 
not complicated in the case of S by any reflection phenomenon ; the 
residuals for P are definitely grouped about two separate maxima, 
but for S this is not so. The first group (0°-40°) is too small to 
show a decided maximum ; but the position of the maximum is clearly 
Tuarked in the other two by the numbers given in the table. As a 
rough expedient the following corrections have been applied: —

The mean of the errors is ± 073 m., and though there is a sHght 
tendency to increase from the second group to the third, the material 
is fairly homogeneous. Now, comparing this with the mean for P, 
viz. ± 0'31 m., it is clear that we are dealing with a much less 
definitely marked phenomenon, as is indeed well known. Part of 
each of these mean errors is due to errors of reading, &amp;c. ; and this 
part should be approximately the same in both. If we were to calcu- 
late and remove it, the ratio between the two, already greater than 
2 to 1, would be sensibly increased. 

In determining A from P and S, the superior accuracy of P is there- 
fore rendered more or less useless by the uncertainty of S. Galitzin's 
azimuthal method of determining the epicentre has thus obvious 
advantages ; if the epicentre is well determined from the azimuths 
at several stations, and if the time of the catastrophe is determined 
from the Ps at these stations, we should appear to have the material 
in the best shape for improving the tables oi P and S, especially the 
latter. 

But this is a digression from the present investigation, which is 
primarily concerned with the performance of the Milne instruments. 

Putting aside for the present any question of correcting the tables 
for S, and therefore the position of the epicentre (as determined from 
Pulkovo), and consequent correction of the calculated times, it is clear 
that we can compare the performance of the Milne pendulums with 
other instruments on a common basis (though not the ultimate basis) 
by collecting their records for the same earthquakes in the same way. 
This is done in the following Table III., which corresponds to 
Table I. 

It will be seen — 

(a) That there are 5 large positive errors and 8 large negative 
errors, for which no special explanation can be given. In Table T. 
there are 8 negative errors, no positive. 

(b) That in 6 + 5 + 10 + 5 = 26 cases, S has presumably been read 
in place of P. With other instruments there were only 5 such cases. 

(c) That in at least 17 cases a reading has been made which can 
be attributed to a reflected wave. There are, moreover, 9 readings 
intermediate between these and the normal readings, which are extreme 
cases of one or the other. The line of demarcation is not so sharp as 
before. Similarly there are 5 doubtful negative readings. 

(d) In the middle part of the table have been collected within the 
same limits as before what may be fairly regarded, as normal readings. 

They number 25 in all. They do not of themselves suggest 
any corrections to the table for P, but we might use the same correc- 
tions as before. It is simpler, however, to restrict attention to the 
second and largest group, the mean of the errors for which is ± 0'4 m. 
If, however, we include in this the 'doubtful' +l'8m., +l*4m., 
+ 1'2 m., and — I'O m., — 1'2 m., the mean of the errors rises to 
' ± 0"6 m. For other instruments this mean was ± 0'31 m. 

The most significant fact is perhaps that of the whole 05 
readings-only 25 at a severe scrutiny,- and at most {i.e., including

all those marked doubtful) only 39, can be regarded as true readings 
of P; say 40 per cent, at most. With the other machines there are 
87 out of 134, or 65 per cent. 

Coming now to S, and correcting the results (which include those 
transferred from P) as for other instniments, we find 12 large errors ; 
the others are distributed as below : —

The mean of the errors ia ± I'l m. ; for other instruments it was 
± 0'73 m. The ratio of these is about the same as in the case of P. 
But it will be seen that there are acceptable readings of S in 38 cases, 
whereas for the same earthquakes there are only 39 of P at most. 
It is usually considered that the Milne instruments show P but not S. 
The evidence here tabulated points to the conclusion that S is shown 
at least as well as P. It is true that the five earthquakes considered 
are large ones; but it might reasonably be argued that P should 
therefore have the better chance of asserting itself. It seems probable 
that in some cases P could be recovered from the records when it was 
realised that the reading formerly given was that of S. The important 
point is that without any great difficulty it can be settled when 
we have an S reading, for the cases of doubt are few. We may now 
give the 12 large errors excluded as mistakes; they are +35'2m., 
+ 11-9 m., +10-3 m., +9"lm., +8'7m., +8*6 m., the smallest of 
which exceeds the maximum error ( + 3'5 m.) accepted as S by over 5 m. ; 
and on the negative side we have — 4'4 m. , — 4"4 m. , — 5'1 m. , — 8'0 m. , 
+ ll'8m., and — 14'2m. Here the separation is not so marked; but 
there is a full 2 m. interval. Some or all of these negative errors may 
be readings of PEi, but the two largest, which both occur on January 11 
(Toronto — 11"8 m. and Stonyhurst — 14'2 m.), are supported by 
several other readings and probably refer to a preliminary shock. As 
the performance of the Milne pendulums is the main point under

For these earthquakes Pulkovo epicentre determinations were not 
available, but the results from Galitzin instruments at Eskdalemuir are 
published in the ' Geophysical Journal,' and have been adopted for 
use. The computations were kindly made by Mr. A. E. Young, 
formerly Deputy Surveyor-General of the Malay Survey, who is at 
present working at the Oxford University Observatory; and in this 
instance greater care was taken, Mr. Young calculating the distances 
trigonometrically (instead of reading them from a globe) and using 
the tunes and tables to seconds of time in the computations, though 
in giving the results the unit O'lm. has been considered sufficient. 



V. — Comparison of Films for 1911. 

The chief object in using this additional material was as follows. 
It was thought that some of the errors of the Milne instruments might 
be due to faulty readings of the records, susceptible of correction. To 
test the general accuracy of such readings the different stations Vv'ere 
invited to send their films for the year 1911 to Shide, and many 
of them have responded. Some had bound up their films in such a 
way that transmission was undesirable; but films for 1911 have been 
received at Shide from Cape Town, Cork, Toronto, San Fernando, 
Sydney, Helwan (Egypt), Victoria, Ascension, Perth, Seychelles, 
Eskdale, Guildford, and Colombo, and have been systematically 
examined at Shide by Mr. Burgess and Mr. Pring, who have had 
much experience in reading the Shide films. It was thought advisable 
to make this examination quite independently, before knowing 
whether the revised readings would suit the calculated facts better ; and 
indeed the calculations were made at Oxford, so that the Shide readings 
were made in ignorance of the tabular result either before or after. 
On comparing the old and new readings with expectation, it does not 
appear that the new afford any systematic improvement on the old. 
The actual figures for the above five earthquakes are as follows (the 
quantities given being differences from expectation, calculated as already 
indicated). They apply entirely to the phase P, the phase S being 
seldom read from the Milne records.

After consideration of the above figures, it was decided to apply 
no corrections at all, but to accept the original readings as they stand, 
and in Table VI. these are compared with calculated values. The table 
corresponds to Table III. except that A was now used in km., and 
the grouping is therefore a little different. 

There is room for some difference of opinion as to the 17 records 
marked doubtful; but the 12 + 13 + 15 + 3 + 4 = 47 readings in the body 
of the table are probably normal. We thus get at least 47 but not 
more than 64 normal readings out of 108. These figures are better than 
the 1913 figures and encourage the hope that on the whole 50 per cent, 
of the recorded readings for P may be normal ; but the percentage 
cannot be higher than this. 

One feature of the records seems to demand fui-ther investigation. 
There is a suggestion that the readings are divisible into two groups 
separated by about a whole minute; and this applies also to the 
results for 1913, though they are scarcely numerous enough to declare 
it independently. It will be seen that the records — 0'4 m. and — 0'5 m. 
are not represented in either table, thus creating an appearance of 
separation. But this may be purely accidental. 

Coming now to S, Table VII. has been formed in the 
Bame manner as before, adopting the same corrections to the tables 
for time of S. There are three consistent observations of S at A 
= 15,000 kms. for which the tables are scarcely available but wei'e

necessary at this distance than has been assumed. In calculating 
the mean error these observations have been omitted, and the mean 
error is then ± 1"1 m. as before. Including them as they stand 
raises it to ± 1'2 m.

In addition there are three large positive errors ( + 9"9m., +7"8m. 
and +7'8m.) and four large negative ( — 5'2m., — 5'8m., — 6"7m. 
and -S'l m.), which may be reflected waves. The percentage is 
slightly less than before, but, putting 1911 and 1913 together, we 
have 36 + 39 = 75 tolerably certain S readings as against 47 + 25 = 72, 
or possibly 64 + 39 = 103 P readings. The fact that S is as often 
I'eadable as P on Milne seismograms, at any rate for large eai'thquakes, 
seems to be thus fairly well established. 

VI. — Comparison of Milne and Galitzin Instruments. 

To the information conveyed by the above discussion the following 
may be added. At Eskdalemuir Observatory various seismographs have 
been m.ounted side by side for comparison, and Mr. G. W. Walker 
made very careful and thorough comparisons of the relative advan- 
tages as indicated in his book already referred to. It seemed desirable 
at the present juncture to have a formal report on the comparison of 
the Milne instrument with at least one other; and the Galitzin seemed 
the best to select as standard of comparison. Application was there- 
fore made to the Superintendent of the Meteorological Office, and he 
kindly sent the following report, to which the names of L. F. 
Richardson and L. H. G. Dines are attached. 

Comparison betiveen the Milne and the Galitzin types of Seismographs. 

It is convenient to treat the question under several different 
aspects, and a brief description of the two instruments may usefully 
precede the rest. 

It is unnecessary to say much about the Milne instrument. 
Extreme lightness and compactness characterise it, and no simpler 



58 REPORTS ON THE STATE OP SCIENCE. — 1914. 

method of optical registration could well be devised. No expensive 
lenses are needed, and, with the exception of a few parts of the 
mechanism, no specially high-class work is required in manufacture. 
The whole of the apparatus is self-contained and does not take up 
much floor-space. It does not require a continuously darkened room 
in which to work. Two pendulums to record both N.S. and E.W. 
movemients can be installed in the same case and record on the same 
drum. 

The Galitzin instrument, on the other hand, is a very much more 
complicated affair. It is designed to follow a somewhat elaborate 
mathematical theory, and high-class workmanship and accuracy are 
needed in its construction. Its pendulum is shorter than the Milne 
and much heavier — say, seven kilograms. It is hung by two steel 
wires (Zollner system), and has no pivot at all in some cases. Pro- 
vision, however, is made on the pendulum and frame for a steel point 
and cup to be inserted if required. The supporting wires might, with 
advantage, be made of tungsten if corrosion were feared. At the outer 
end of the boom are fixed to the frame four pow^erful horseshoe 
magnets. Between the poles of one pair of these moves a set of wire 
coils fixed to the boom and coupled in series with a delicate galvano- 
meter placed in any convenient position elsewhere. Between the 
other pair is a large copper plate, also fixed to the boom, and this last 
acts as a magnetic damper. The magnets can be adjusted as desired 
to vary the magnetic field between the poles. 

The galvanometer is of the moving coil type, and has a long period 
of oscillation when undamped. This galvanometer is an excellent 
piece of work and is electrically damped so that it can be rendered 
just aperiodic. With the whole instrument in normal workin_g it is 
necessary that the undamped periods of both pendulum and galvano- 
meter should be the same, and that they both should be damped just 
to the limit of aperiodicity. 

The optical registration consists of a collimator with a fine slit 
powerfully illuminated. The beam is reflected from a min'or on the 
galvanometer and thence to the recording dram, whei^e a cylindrical 
lens condenses the line of light into a point on the paper. 

The two pendulums for recording N.S. and E.W. movements are 
under entirely separate covers, and in a more refined installation two 
separate drums are also used; but it is possible to use one dram only 
and arrange the spots of light from the two galvanometers side by 
side. 

A good deal of floor space is required, and the room in which the 
recording parts are placed must be kept dark. 

The galvanometers and recording drum may be placed in a separate 
room altogether; and, in fact, are better so placed. The presence of 
the attendant is likely to disturb the pendulum if he brings his weight 
near the pillar on which it stands. The recording part of the 
apparatus is quite unaffected by disturbances in the room in which it 
is placed.

Registriermethode, ' by Prince B. Galitzin, Academy of Sciences, 
St. Petersburg. 

The Galitzin recorder for vertical movements operates electrically 
in exactly the same manner as the horizontal instrument, and a similar 
magnetic damper is fitted to it. The room in which the pendulum 
is placed must be maintained as far as possible at a uniform tempera- 
ture, as the change in the elasticity of the spring which supports the 
pendulum causes excessive wandering if the temperature changes by 
even as little as 0.5 per cent. 

Comparative cost. — A Galitzin installation is much more expensive 
than a corresponding Milne one. Two horizontal pendulums complete 
with galvanometer and one recording drum cost at least 148Z., while 
the pendulum for vertical movements with galvanometer and drum 
costs at least llOL 

This does not exhaust the expensiveness of the instruments, since 
about six times as much sensitive paper is required for one Galitzin 
recording drum as for one modern Milne drum for two pendulums. 
It is customary to run the paper at three centimetres per minute, and 
unless the optical arrangements were improved it would be hardly 
feasible to run it at much less speed without losing a good deal. 
Under these circumstances the cost in paper alone of one recorder is 
about 33L per annum. 

Attention required. — The Milne instrument does not require more 
than ordinary skilled attention. If the operator be used to handling 
delicate instruments little more is required. Of the Galitzin instrument 
the same may be said as far as the ordinary routine is concerned, but 
the greater complexity of the apparatus means a greater number of 
things liable to go wrong, and sooner or later it is almost certain 
to happen that highly skilled attention is necessary. Both types of 
instrument require periodical standardisation, but while in the Milne 
type this is quite a simple process, in the Galitzin it is quite otherwise. 
A certain amount of auxiliary apparatus is required, such as telescopes 
and scales, and two persons are necessary to make simultaneous obser- 
vations of the pendulum and galvanometer; when these have been 
made the constants of the instrument can be determined. Prince 
Galitzin has worked out formulae for this purpose. 

The whole process has in general to be gone through twice for each 
instrument, and it is a lengthy operation, taking probably about two 
working days. A certain measure of observational skill is required to 
take the necessary readings accurately, as well as a fair working know- 
ledge of mathematics to deal with the results when obtained. 

It would be possible to simplify the process somewhat more 
than has at present been done, and reduce it largely to routine; but 



60 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 

a Galitzin installation must always require a greater measure of 
skilled attention to run it successfully than is the case with the 
simpler types of instruments. 

It is difficult to estimat-6 what is the minimum of mathematical 
and physical knowledge that must be possessed by an assistant in order 
to maintain successfully a Galitzin installation. A working know- 
ledge of algebra is essential, arid probably with this as a basis an 
intelligent operator could learn the rest of the routine with the aid 
of computing-forms. But without a knowledge of higher mathematics, 
and particularly elementary differential equations, it is impossible to 
understand the meaning of the formulae by which the constants are 
determined. 

Results obtainable. — ^The Milne type of instrument is very sensitive 
as a mere seismoscope. With the exception of very faint movements 
indeed, some record of a distant quake can always be obtained by it ; 
this is due to the absence of damping and almost entire absence of 
solid friction ; by altering the period of oscillation of the boom 
it can be made particularly sensitive to any wave-period desired. 
The instrument at Eskdalemuir Observatory has at present a period 
of about eighteen seconds, and this corresponds approximately 
with the wave periods from very faint and I'emote shocks. For 
waves of this type the Milne instrument leaves some record of 
almost any earthquake that affects the Galitzin instrument; but 
whereas the latter gives a trace that approximately follows the actual 
movements of the ground, the trace from the former has little re- 
semblance to it. Maximum movements on the Milne record may 
or may not coincide with the maximum movements of the ground : 
it depends on the type of the earth movements and on the period of 
the pendulum. By damping slightly, a more faithful record can be 
obtained, and by making the pendulum actually dead beat a moderately 
close agreement will prevail between the actual earth movements and 
those worked out from the record. This can be established theoreti- 
cally, but Prince Galitzin has also conducted experiments which show 
that theory and practice are in close agi'eement. See Professor 0. G. 
Knott's book on ' The Physics of Earthquake Phenomena,' chapter 5, 
Unfortunately the reduction in the scale of the record which accom- 
panies damping renders the Milne pendulum very insensitive when 
damped. For some months an oil damper has been fitted to one of the 
Milne pendulums at Eskdalemuir; the ratio of successive elongations 
is approximately 2:4. The results obtained are disappointing for the 
reason given above. 

If any satisfactory means could be found of increasing the magnifi- 
cation optically even by a moderate amount, the damped Milne 
pendulum should be capable of yielding good results, and the greater 
simplicity of standardisation should be another point in its favour. 

Turning to the Galitzin type of machine, as an instrument of 
precision it may safely be said to be ahead of all others. The inter- 
pretation of its records is not a very simple matter, but by those 
prepared to spend the time a vast amount of information can be 



ON SEISMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS. 61 

obtained. The scale of magnification varies widely with different wave- 
periods, being in general approximately 800 as a maximum and for 
periods of about fourteen seconds, and falling off for either longer or 
shorter periods. 

The preliminary tremors of a distant earthquake can be examined 
particularly well, and individual impulses analysed. An experienced 
observer can analyse these preliminary phases from the shape and 
general appearance of the record far more easily than can be done in 
the case of the undamped Milne record. See ' Modern Seismology,' 
by G. W. Walker, F.R.S., chapter 7, for fuller information on this 
point. 

It is probably safe to say that a full and rigid investigation into 
the theory of these instruments has not yet been published, and the 
possibilities of deducing complicated formulae in that direction are vast. 
The high degree of accuracy that in favourable circumstances has been 
obtained in locating epicentres, using the records from a single station 
only, is sufficient to demonstrate the excellence of the instrument as 
at present used. It would be well to state here that, though the 
Galitzin record does not represent the ground motion accurately in 
many cases, yet in the case of the first movement of the first 
phase P of an earthquake the movements on the N.S. and E.W. 
records will be proportional to the actual earth movements provided 
that the two pendulums and galvanometers are in correct adjustment 
and have the same undamped period. Hence the azimuth can in 
favourable circumstances be accurately and easily determined, though 
to work out the actual earth movements would be a complicated 
matter. 

One point worthy of mention in which the Galitzin instrument 
differs from most or perhaps all others is the absence of trouble 
arising from the wandering of the pendulum. However the latter may 
wander, the zero of the galvanometer is unaffected. The scale value 
may be altered slightly if the pendulum be far from the middle 
position, but this can easily be corrected from time to time. This 
quality renders the instrument useless for determining slow changes in 
tilt, as can' be done with other types. 

Mention has been made above of varying scale value; this intro- 
duces another limitation. For very short periods the magnification 
is very small, being about 110 for one-second period and varying 
directly as the period for lesser values. 

Hence rapid vibrations will leave no record, and this may be 
the explanation of the fact that small local earthquakes are not 
recorded on this type of instrument. 

Owing to the high degree of magnification and great sensitivity, 
some trouble is experienced from disturbances due to high winds, 
and from experience at Eskdalemuir it would seem desirable to house 
the pendulum in a small sheltered building rather than a large exposed 
one. Heavy weights moving in the vicinity cause trouble, as with any 
other sensitive instruments ; but the records so produced being of definite 
character can be readily traced to their origin, and are immaterial if not

of a long-continued series of uniform waves; but it is noteworthy that 
in the Milne type it cannot be applied to any other kind of motion and 
may be considerably in error even one or two minutes after the 
commencement of the series. 

In the Galitzin type, however, the free motion dies away much 
more rapidly. 

VII. — Present Vahie of the Milne Instrument. 

We may summarise the present situation as follows: — 

(a) The Milne instrument is undamped, but for one purpose — viz., 
the determination of times of arrival of P and S — this does not matter. 
There has been an idea that S (or Pa) is not easy to read on Milne 
records; but S has often been read in mistake for P, and when these 
readings are counted properly S seems to be identifiable as often as P. 
On the other hand, the absence of damping makes the readings of 
maximum of uncertain significance. 

(b) The time scale of the Milne instrument is small and its magni- 
fication is also small. Both might be increased with advantage, and 
it seems probable that then the times of arrival of P and S could 
be read as well as on most other instruments. 

(c) The present wide dispersion of Milne stations niakes the records 
of great value. Most of the modern instruments are in Europe. For 



ON SEISMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS. 63 

an earthquake in Europe they are distributed in various azimuths 
(not quite a complete circuit even then), but for distant quakes they 
cluster in the same azimuth and give no material for discussion in 
azimuth (see Section VIII.). The Milne stations, however, especially 
those in Australia, can supply this information. 

It is clear, then, that the usefulness of the Milne instruments is 
by no means at an end, as the perfection of modern seismographs 
(especially the Galitzin instrument) might at first suggest. And it 
should not be difficult to extend it considerably. 

(a) It can be ia))iped effectually. Mr. J. J. Shaw, of West Brom- 
wich, has done this electro-magnetically with an aluminium plate 
in place of the Galitzin copper plate, which is too heavy for the light 
Milne boom. At present, however, he has not obtained simultaneously 
sufficient magnification to give the damping effect: damping is 
chiefly of use for following the movements of the long waves, and the 
scale should be big enough to show them clearly. Mr. Shaw is still 
at work on the instrument, and hopes to obtain the requisite magnifi- 
cation. 

(b) There should be little difficulty in increasing the magnification 
moderately both in movement and in time scale, though it may 
not be easy to settle which is the very best way of doing it. The 
experiments being made by various observers should at least give us 
a feasible plan. 

(c) Meanwhile if special attention is paid to getting good time 
determinations, and if the films are carefully read with a lens, the times 
of arrival of P and S for Milne stations should enable us to correct 
the tables for considerable distances from the epicentre where the 
European stations all agree and are all in error owing to their con- 
gestion in azimuth. (See next Section.) 

VIII. — Correction of the Tables for P and S. 

Recurring to the discussion of Section IV., it was shown that the tables 
for both P and S were sensibly in error, and the question arises how far 
they can be corrected. The main facts are these : — 

(a) The tables for small values of A are sensibly correct. This is 
shown by the agreement of determinations of epicentres from Pulkovo 
and Eskdalemuir, quoted by G. W. Walker in his monograph (p. 65). 
From each station the azimuth a and the distance A can be determined ; 
and from the two azimuths a and a.^ the epicentre can be determined 
without reference to A at all.^ This is a modern advance, the importance 
of which is not easily over-estimated. If then the values of A determined 
from the P and S tables agree (to a fraction of a degree) with those found 
from the azimuths, the tables must be fairly correct. The value of A 
is about 20°. 

(li) But this single example may give quite a wrong impression of 
the accuracy with which an epicentre is at present determined. _ At 
greater distances we gradually lose the accordance between these stations. 
Thus, on January 4, 1912, Pulkovo gives 175° E., 49°'5 N., and Eskdale- 

' See letter of Galitzin aud Walker in iV^oittre for September 5^ 1912. 



64 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 

muir 177° E., 51° N. ; on July 9 Pulkovo gives 30°-3 E., 2°-l N., and Eskdale- 
muir 33°-9 E. and 5°-3 N. ; and at greater distances still the discordance 
may be 5° or even 10°. The azimuths may still be good, though as the 
azimuthal lines do not meet so sharply, the determination becomes less 
definite ; and, moreover, it must be remembered that actual errors in 
the adjustment of the booms become of greater importance. We have 
nothing to set against the clear evidence ofiEered in Section IV. that the 
tables for S are in error, though since the errors there found are only 
relative, we may add a constant to them all, substituting, for instance, for

Similarly the errors for P might be written — 

Error at 15° 35° 55° 75° 95° 115° 

m. m. m. m. m. m. 

0-0 0-0 +0-1 +0-2 +0-4 +0-6 

if we determine to keep the error small near the epicentre. In this case 
it seems possible that the revised tables just published by the K.G. Landes- 
antalt fiir Meteorologie und Geodynamik in Zagreb (Agram) might supply 
information which would determine the unknown arbitrary constant. 
The errors of the Galitzin tables indicated by Zagreb at the above points 
are 

m. m. m m. m. m. 

+0-1 +0-1 0-0 +0-1 +0.2 +0-3 

Difference +0-1 +0-1 —0-1 -0-1 -0-2 -0-3 

The differences do not, however, remain constant, even approximately. 
The present comparison indicates larger errors for values of A greater 
than 75° than the Zagreb tables admit. 

It thus appears that the moment is not yet come to suggest corrections 
to the tables which are likely to meet with general acceptance. It seems 
better to retain the old tables until a much greater mass of material has 
been discussed, and the old tables will accordingly be used for the com- 
parisons made at Shide at any rate for the observations of 1914. The 
discussion of some 100 earthquakes should provide corrections approxi- 
mating to definitive ones. Meanwhile, the best available corrections 
to the tables from the material above discussed, incorporating the in- 
formation derived from the next section, are given at the end of the next 
section. 

IX. — Discussion in Azimuth. 

If the receiving stations are arranged in azimuth (A) round the epi- 
centre, then 

(a) Assuming the velocity of transmission constant in all azimuths, 
any error (8) of position of the epicentre will give rise to an error 

c + e cos (A — Aq) 

in the observed times at the stations : where Aq is the azimuth in which 
the epicentre is erroneously displaced ; A is the azimuth of the receiving 



ON SEISMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS. 65 

station ; c is the eiTect of the displacement (8) on P or S, as the case may 
be, at the distance of tlie receiving station ; and c is a constant depending 
on the position of Pnlkovo, or other station from which the epicentre is 
determined. 

(b) If the velocity of transmission varies with the azimuth, then, if the 
velocity in azimuth A is not the same as in azimuth A + 180°, there will 
be a first-order harmonic which will be mixed up with that just written, 
due to the error in position of epicentre ; and it may be difficult to separate 
the two. If, however, the velocity is the same for A and A + 180°, then 
we may look for a second-order harmonic to represent the variation. It 
will be seen from what follows that there are no trustworthy indications 
of such terms from the material now discussed. The material is insufficient 
to pronounce definitely against the existence of such terms, especially 
with small coefficients ; but it is apparently sufficient to discredit any 
large term of the kind. For instance, Milne suggested a velocity N. 
and S. sensibly less, in the case of the large waves, from the velocity 
E. and W. (Eighteenth Report, § v). No such difference can be detected 
in the velocities for P and S. 

We will first give in some detail the results for a single earthquake, 
that of 1913, January 11, adopted epicentre 6° N., 117° E. The residuals 
for P, when corrected for distance from epicentre as in Section IV., and 
arranged in azimuth measured from the N. point round the epicentre in 
the direction N., E., S., W., are as shown in Table VIII. 

We see at a glance the better distribution of the Milne pendulums ; 
most of the modern pendulums are in Europe and appear in the same 
azimuth-class 300°— 330°. Were it not for the Milne instruments we 
should have very scanty material for an azimuth discussion ; and yet 
this is one of the most favourable cases. The inferiority of the Milne 
instrument suggests giving a smaller weight to its records, but it will be 
seen that we should gain very little thereby. Taking the simple means 
as in the last column and filling in vacant terms by simple interpolation 
(in brackets), we can make a very rough harmonic analysis, obtaining 

-1-6 + 7-5 cos (A-330°) + 2-7 cos 2 (A - 70°). 
Treating the S observations in the same way, we get Table IX. 

The material for discussion in azimuth is even more scanty and un- 
certain than before ; but, analysing it for what it is worth, we get 

- 1-2 -f 8-0 cos (A - 332°) + 4-7 cos 2 (A - 177°). 

Now, considering the nature of the material and of the process used, 
it is somewhat remarkable that the results from P and S should accord 
so well in indicating a correction to the epicentre. The direction is in 
azimuth 331° say, and as the azimuth of Pulkovo is 330°, it is pretty 
clear that the estimated A for Pulkovo is in error, owing doubtless to 
the errors of the tables. The amount of displacement is not so easy to 
assess. In the above simple process we have treated all stations, at 
whatever distance from the epicentre, alike. A displacement of the 
epicentre of 1° will, however, alter the times of arrival of P by 16 s. near 
the epicentre, by 5^ s. at 90°, and by less still at greater distances. Never- 
theless, on calculating the alterations for the actual distances, the mean

68 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 

for the difEerent groups was found to be nearly constant at about 8 s. 
Since tlie coefficient (8 units of 0-1 m.) means 48 s., we may take it that 
the epicentre is about 6° wrong. As regards direction, note that the 
observed times for receiving stations on the side of the epicentre remote 
from Pulkovo are too small ; so that the epicentre must be moved nearer 
to them and further from Pulkovo. The observed S-P at Pulkovo, viz. 
10 m. 24 s., does not correspond (as indicated by the present tables) to an 
epicentral distance of 83°-5, but to a distance of 89°-5. 

Turning to S, we find the average value of 1° to be about 13 s. The 
first harmonic of S thus indicates a displacement of 48713 or 3°-7. We 
may regard this as a satisfactory confirmation of the magnitude of the 
error, which may be put at about 5°. 

The second harmonics in both cases are small, and the phases are 
quite discordant. We may fairly say that there is no evidence of a varia- 
tion in velocity of an elliptic type. 

As regards other earthquakes analysed for azimuth the following 
notes will suffice : — 

1913, March 14. Epicentre 11° N., 123° E., distant 82° from Pulkovo. 

Of nearly same type as that of 1913, January 11, but distribution of 
stations not so good. The numbers in the 30° divisions for P are 

1100121114 33 5 

and the harmonic expression is (in units of 0-1 m.) 

+ 0-2 + 5-0 cos (A — 302°) + 4-0 cos 2 (A — 36°). 

For S the number of stations are 

1100060002 24 3 

and the harmonic expression is 

_.. 7.8 + 14-5 cos (A — 345°) — 4-2 cos 2 (A — 7°). 

In spite of the broken nature of the series, the indication of 
an error of about 4° or 5° in A is tolerably plain. The azimuth 
of Pulkovo is 330°, and the magnitudes of the displacement assigned 
by the P observations may be put at 30°/8 = 3°-8. 

„ S „ „ „ 87°/13 = 6°-7. 

There is some indication of a second order term, but it cannot be 
regarded very seriously. 

1913, March 23. Epicentre 26° N., 143° E., distant 18° from Pulkovo. 

The only available observations between azimuths 0° and 210° are 
two Milne observations of P and one Milne of S. There seems no 
advantage in making even a rough estimate. 

1913, April 30. Epicentre 50° N ., 176° E., distant 67° from Pidkovo.

Harmonic expressions 

from P + 2-1 + 2-7 cos (A — 207°) + 3-6 cos 2 (A - 73°) 
from S + 0-5 + 11-0 cos (A - 235°) + 2-6 cos 2 (A — 160°) 

Azimuth of Pulkovo being 342°, the mean direction of displacement 
(azimuth 220° say) is nearly at right angles to the direction of Pulkovo, 
and cannot be wholly explained by an error of tables. The small com- 
ponent in the line joining epicentre to Pulkovo is in the opposite direction 
to that previously noted. 

1913, June U. Epicentre 43° N., 26° E., distant 11° from Pulkovo. 

There are unfortunately no observations of S from azimuth 90° to 
270°, so that we cannot make any analysis. The mean results for the 
other azimuths are 

Azimuth 270°— 300°— 330°— 0°— 30°— 60°— 90° 

Mean +1 — 4 —2—4+40 

No observations 4 4 11 2 2 1 

which suggest a displacement in the opposite direction to that of January 11 
and March 14, and in the same direction as the component of April 30. 
The numbers for P are 

1412001043 11 2 

and the harmonic expression is 

+ 2-1 + 2-8 cos (6 - 165°) + 1-6 cos 2 (0 - 111°) 

The azimuth of Pulkovo being 7°, the small displacement indicated is 
nearly radial and in the opposite direction to those of January 11 and 
March 14. 

Hence, so far as this evidence goes, the error of S-P is about 30 s. at 
85°, diminishes at lesser distances, and changes to a small negative value. 
The corrections needed by the Galitzin tables would seem to be approxi- 
mately as follows : —

Investigation of the Upper Atmosphere. — Thirteenth Report of 
the Committee, consisting of Dr. W. In. Shaw (Chairman), 
Mr. E. Gold (Secretary), Messrs. C. J. P. Cave and W. H. 
Dines, Dr. E. T. Glazebrook, Sir J. Larmoe, Professor 
J. E. Petavel, Dr. A. Schuster, and Dr. W. Watson. 

A MEETING of the Joint Committee was held in the rooms of the Eoyal 
Meteorological Society on May 5, 1914. It was decided to allocate the 
grant from the British Association towards the expense of investigations 
with pilot balloons over the ocean to be undertaken by the Secretary 
on the journey to Australia, via the Cape of Good Hope. An 



70 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 

additional grant was made from the funds of the Royal Meteorological 
Society to enable simultaneous observations to be made by Dr. W. 
Eosenhain, of the National Physical Laboratory, on the journey via 
the Suez Canal. A report on the observations is in preparation and 
will be pubHshed in due course. 

The report by Mr. G. I. Taylor on the observations which he made 
on board the Scotia in 1913, referred to in the Committee's report last 
year, has been pubHshed in the official account of the results of the 
Scotia Expedition, issued by the Board of Trade. The results which 
Mr. Taylor obtained throw much light on the formation of fog and 
on the propagation of heat through the atmosphere by means of eddies. 
He found generally that thick fogs were associated with a large increase 
in the temperature of the air in a vertical direction, while light fogs 
occurred when the increase was small. 

The Committee records with regret the death during the year of 
Mr. Douglas Archibald, who was one of the earliest investigators of 
the upper air by means of kites, and had served on the Committee 
since its appointment at Glasgow in 1901. 

The Committee asks for reappointment, with a grant of 25Z. 



Radiotelegraphic Investigations. — Interim Report of the Com- 
mittee, consisting of Sir Oliver Lodge (Chairman) , Dr. W. H. 
EccLES (Secretary), Mr. Sidney G. Brown, Dr. C. Chree, 
Professor A. S. Eddington, Dr. Erskine-Murray, Professors 
J. A. Fleming, G. W. 0. Howe, and H. M. Macdonald, 
Sir H. Norman, Captain H. E. Sankey, Professor A. 
Schuster, Dr. W. N. Shaw, and Professor S. P. Thompson. 

The past year has been occupied mainly by the designing, printing, 
and distribution of books of forms for recording observations, by the 
enrolment of observers, and by the preliminary work in connection with 
the observations to be made during the forthcoming solar eclipse. 

I. Collection of Ordinary Daily Statistics. 

We have obtained the cordial support of many Government Depart- 
ments of the British Empire and of other countries. In the British 
Empire the Navy has taken forms sufficient to distribute to about 
120 ships. The Post Office has sent forms to nine stations. The 
Government of Canada have undertaken to get statistics from four 
stations on the Pacific Coast. The South African Government have 
authorised the collection of statistics at Cape Town and Durban. The 
Australian Government have brought eight stations into the scheme, and 
the New Zealand Government and the Indian Government each several 
stations. The Colonial Office has kindly circularised other of the 
Colonies, and of these the following have already replied favourably, and 
have had supplies of forms despatched to them : — 

Falkland Islands. Zanzibar. British Guiana. 

Bahamas Somaliland. Jamaica. 

Trinidad. Fiji. Sierra Leone. 

Ceylon. Gold Coast. 



ON RADIOTELEGRAPHIC INVESTIGATIONS. 71 

The Government, of Norway have agreed to have statistics collected 
at four stations; the United States Government at five; in Germany 
the Telegraphs Versuchsamt is making observations at Berlin, and 
there are some Eussian Government stations likely to co-operate. 

The following Companies are taking a prominent part in the collec- 
tion of statistics : The Marconi International Marine Communication 
Company, Ltd., have already twenty-three ships at work; the Marconi 
Company of Canada have thirteen stations at work on the East Coast of 
Canada, in Newfoundland and on the Great Lakes; the American Mar- 
coni Company have put fifteen land stations (between Alaska and the 
Gulf of Mexico) to work, and several ships; the Federal Wireless Tele- 
graph Company of America have started observations at their San 
Francisco station ; the Gesellschaft fur drahtlose Telegraphie will put a 
considerable number of stations to work as soon as forms have been 
translated, and they have the intention of establishing a small prize 
scheme amongst their operators for the best series of obsei-vations. At 
the Slough station the Anglo-French Wireless Company started obser- 
vations which will be continued by the Galletti Company ; while the 
English Mai'coni Company are doing the like at Chelmsford. 

With regard to Eussia, the language difficulty was likely to prove 
formidable, but the Editor of the Eussian ' Journal of Wireless Tele- 
graphy ' has arranged that the forms be translated into Eussian and 
that the collection of statistics be urged upon readers of his Journal. 
The Societe Eusse de T^l^graphes et T6l6phones sans Fil have agreed 
that the forms, when translated, shall he used at a number of the 
stations under the control of the Company in Eussia. 

Among private experimenters of note we have obtained the support 
of several gentlemen abroad, who will doubtless have to be mentioned 
in subsequent reports. There are also a number of Professors in the 
British Isles and in the Colonies helping, and about sixty-one amateurs. 
Of these there are thirty-six in England, two in Scotland, six in Ireland, 
and one in Wales. 

A considerable number of completed forms have already come to 
hand and a start has been made on the analysis. 

II. Observations to he made during the Eclipse of August 21, 1914. 

The central line of the eclipse passes across Norway, Sweden, the 
Baltic, Central Eussia, the Black Sea, and Persia, to the coast of India. 
Accordingly, the Governments of Noi'way, Sweden, Eussia, and India 
have been approached. The Noi-wegian Government have generously 
placed practically all their stations at the disposal of the Committee ; 
tlie Swedish Government have agreed that the observations they wish to 
make on their own behalf shall be made in accord with the pi-ogramme 
of the Committee, to whom copies will be supplied ; and the Eussian 
Government will set a number of stations to work, but the number and 
position of these have not yet been settled. The Soci6t6 Eusse will place 
their high-power station at St. Petersburg at the disposal of the Com- 
mittee, and the Gesellschaft fiir drahtlose Telegraphie is also willing 
to allow two or three large stations to come into the scheme. This 



72 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 

Company will enact tHat observations on the day of the eclijose shall be 
compulsory in many of its stations in the Baltic and in Germany. The 
Indian Government have agreed to help also. In Western Europe the 
transmission of special signals is not of such great importance as in 
the districts nearer the central line of the eclipse, but some observa- 
tions ought to be instituted on signals in that part of the world. The 
Marconi Company have kindly expressed their willingness to aid the 
Committee by transmitting from certain high-power stations a few 
special signals, if desired, at times to be arranged by the Committee. 

Many private observers in different parts of the world have signified 
their wilUngness to make a special effort on the day of the ecliiDse. It 
has been explained to the authorities in the United States, Canada, 
Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand, that although there is not 
much likelihood of the effects of the eclipse being perceived in their 
territories, yet they will be advised of the programme of the Com- 
mittee, in order that they may, if they will, determine precisely whether 
there is, or is not, any effect. Since it seemed important to enlist the 
sympathies of as large a number as possible ol skilled observers on the 
Eastern boundaries of GeiTnany, Austria, and Hungary, the Editor of 
the ' Jahrbuch fiir drahtlose Telegraphie ' was asked, and has agreed, 
to seek German-speaking observers, conduct all preliminary corre- 
spondence with them, translate forms and get them printed and dis- 
tributed, and to collect the forms. It has recently been arranged that a 
large proportion of this work may be shared with the International 
Commission of Brussels. 

In addition to all this welcome assistance, we are especially glad 
to report that the Board of the Admiralty have agreed to co-operate on 
an extensive scale. 



The Belatiovfi hciv&gt;een this Commiliee and llie lulcrnational 
Commission of Brussels. 

As a member of the British Section of the International Commission, 
the Secretary was made a delegate to the recent Conference in Brussels, 
and there suggested that it might be to the advantage of both organisa- 
tions, especially when requesting assistance from Government Depart- 
ments or Companies, or even private experimenters, that a public 
announcement should be made showing that the aims of the two bodies 
are different, that there is room for both, that there is little danger of 
any Government or Company or private experimenter being asked to 
do the same thing twice, or to favour one to the detriment of the other ; 
and that if on any occasion there were overlapping, then the two 
organisations should endeavour to coi-operate. The International 
Commission therefore drew up and passed the following resolution : — 

' La Commission Internationale de T.S.F.S., ayant pris connais- 
sance du but des travaux du ' ' Committee for Radio-telegraphic Investi- 
gation of the British Association," estime que les travaux des deux 
organisations ont des objets diff brents. 

' La Commission Internationale de T.S.F.S. se propose, en effet, de 
faire des recherches qui portent principalement sur les mesures quantita-

tiives se rapportant h remission, k la propagation et h la reception des 
ondes eleclriques. 

' L'Association Britannique a decide, de son c6t6, de recueillir, de 
classer et de commenter les resultats des observations susceptibles de 
faii'e ressortir les relations entre les ph^nomenes geophysiques et la 
propagation des ondes electriques. II entre egalement dans ses vues de 
dresser la statistique et de faire 1 'etude des phenomfenes anormaux et des 
perturbations atmospheriques. 

' En consequence, si les champs d'activite des deux organisations 
viennent a avoir des points communs, la Commission Internationale de 
T.S.P.S. engage ses adherents a preter eventuellement le concours le 
plus complet i la " British Association." ' 

At a meeting of the British Association Committee on May 8, 1914, 
the following resolution was adopted: — 

' That the Eadiotelegraphic Investigation Committee of the British 
Association for the Advancement of Science take cognisance of the 
resolution adopted by the Commission Internationale de Telegraphie sans 
Fils Scientifique at the recent conference in Brussels, and desire to 
affirm that they find themselves in full accord with the definitions, as 
expresse^l in the resolution, of the differences between the aims and 
methods of the researches promoted by the two organisations ; while, 
in regard to those researches in which the two bodies both take an 
active interest, this Committee warmly welcome and value highly the 
offer of co-operation, and gladly undertake to give all assistance in 
their power. ' i 

The Committee has expended up to the present in office expenses, 
printing, and distribution of forms, the sum of 144L 

[Note. — The following communication was circulated to Members of the Com- 
mittee by the Secretary on behalf of the Chairman in December, 1914 : — 

The war has naturally had a very direct effect on radiotelegraphic investi- 
gations. About August 1 last, private wireless telegraph stations throughout 
the Empire were nearly all dismantled or taken possession of by military authori- 
ties, while naval and other Government stations stopped all merely scientific 
observing. The radiotelegraphic stations in Russia, Germany, and neighbouring 
countries doubtless discontinued the filling up of our forms as soon as mobilisa- 
tion began. A few stations in India, Australia, Canada, the West Indies, and 
the United States are, however, still at work. In the last-named country about 
thirty stations are making observations. 

The Committee's programme for the collection of statistics three days a week 
in all parts of the English-speaking world and in a few other countries was 
planned to embrace one complete round of the seasons. The fact that the pro- 
gramme has been interrupted after only three months of really full work 
diminishes greatly the scientific value of such statistics as have been collected. 
It also implies considerable financial loss. A large batch of forms was distri- 
buted to our Navy in July : in clearing for action these forms would probably 
be wasted. The Gei-man edition was distributed in June. The Russian edition 
also was probably distributed before the outbreak of war. 

The extensive scheme of special observations projected for the occasion of 
the solar eclipse failed almost completely in the countries in which the eclipse 
was visible. A small amount of work was done in Norway and Sweden. All 
the necessary forms had been printed, and some had been circulated before the 
war started". The financial loss to the Committee in this re.spect exceeds a 
hundred pounds. 



74 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 

The day-by-day statistics collected in the period April to July are now being 
analysed. The conclusions drawn from these observations will, it may be 
hoped, have some scientific value of their own, and in any case they should yield 
information which may guide the Committee, when the time comes, to further 
attacks on the problems concerned. A similar thought may be set down as 
consolation for the eclipse failure. 

In October last, at a special meeting summoned by the Inspector of Wireless 
Telegraphy at the General Post OflBce, where it happened that the Committee 
were represented by Dr. Erskine-Murray and the Secretary, the Committee were 
asked to draw up for the Home Office a list of gentlemen distributed over the 
British Isles who would be veiling, if and when called upon, to assist the 
police by acting as voluntary experts in wireless telegraphy. The police cannot 
in general be expected to possess sufficient technical knowledge to discriminate 
between dangerous radiotelegraphic apparatus and other apparatus. Co-operation 
with the police authorities in each locality by someone possessing technical 
knowledge will help to prevent blunders and may assist in detecting illicit 
traffic. Accordingly gentlemen whose names appear in the address book of the 
Committe.e have been written to, and lists of voluntary experts have been sup- 
plied to the Home Office.] 



Establishing a Solar Observatory in Australia. — Report of the 
Committee, consisting of Px-ofessor H. H. Turner {Chair- 
man), Dr. W. G. DuFFiELD {Secretary), Eev. A. L. Cortie, 
Dr. F. W. Dyson, and Professors A. S. Eddington, H. F. 
Newall, J. W. Nicholson, and A. Schuster, appointed to 
aid the ivork of Establishing a Solar Observatory in Australia. 

The Committee records with great sorrow the death of its former 
Chairman Sir David Gill, whose name has always been so prominently 
associated with scientific enterprises connected with the Southern 
Hemisphere. Professor H. H. Turner has been appointed Chairman 
in his place. 

The Secretary has great pleasure in reporting that the following 
letter has been received from the Commonwealth Authorities in re- 
sponse to further representations regarding the desirability of erecting 
a Solar Observatory within the Commonwealth: — 

Commonwealth Offices, 

72 Victoria Street, Westminster, S.W. 

March 10, 1914. 
Dear Dr. Duffield, 

With reference to previous correspondence in regard to the estab- 
lishment of a Solar Observatory in Australia, I desire to inform you 
that I have now received a memorandum from the Commonwealth 
Government advising that in the scheme for the organisation of services 
in connection with the Seat of Government at Canberra, provision 
has been made for the establishment amongst general astronomical 
studies of a section to be devoted to solar physics in particular. 

Yours sincerely, 
(Signed) R. Muieiie.\d Cotjjns. 
Dr. Geoffrey Duffield, 

University College, Beading. 

The Committee records its great satisfaction at the promise of the 



ON ESTABLISHING A SOLAR OBSERVATORY IN AUSTRALIA. 75 

institution of Solar Research in Australia — an end for which it has 
worked since its appointment at the Dublin Meeting of the Association 
in 1908. The Prime Minister of the Commonwealth has consented 
to receive a deputation of overseas astronomers with regard to the 
nature of the solar work which should be undertaken in Australia. 



The Calculation of Mathematical Tables.— Report of the Com- 
mittee, consisting of Professor M. J. M. Hill (Chairman) , 
Professor J. W. Nicholson (Secretary), Mr. J. R. Airey, 
Professor L. N. G. Filon, Sir George Greenhill, Professor 
B. W. HoBSON, Professor Alfred Lodge, Professor 
A. E. H. Love, Professor H. M. Macdonald, and Professor 
A. G. Webster. 

The grant given to the Committee during the past year has been ex- 
pended on the calculation of the Logarithmic Bessel Functions, for which 
it was specially allocated. In the present report are Tables of the functions 
Yo(a;) and Yi(a;), whose significance was explained on page 29 of the last 
report. These proceed from argument x = 0-02 to a; = 15-50, at 
intervals of 0-02, and are correct to six significant figures. 

Some further Tables of the functions G„(a;) are also included, for 
varying order n of the functions. These are incomplete at present. The 
Committee is proceeding with the further calculation of the functions 

Yo(x), Yg(x), on the same scale as the present Tables of Yq 

and Yi. 

The Committee desires to ask for a further grant of 301. during the 
coming year, to be allocated to this work. 

Some Tables calculated by Mr. Doodson, of the University of Liverpool, 
are given at the end of the report. They deal with the functions of 
type J,i + x{x), where n is a positive or negative integer. A considerable 
demand for these Tables exists at present. Mr. Doodson is continuing 
this work, and it is suggested that his name be added to the Committee. 
The previous requisition that a large number of copies of the report 
(about 100) should be placed in the hands of the Secretary for distribution 
is repeated, as the demand for these Tables from physicists is increasing. 

Tables of the Neumann Functions Yo(a;) and Y,(a;) or Bessel Functions of 

the Second Kind. 

The second solution of Bessel's differential equation 

has been given in several forms — G„(x), Y„(x), K„(x), &amp;c. Tables 
of Go(a?) and G.(x) for values of x from 0-01 to 16-00 by intervals of 0-01 
were published in the report for 1913. 

Short Tables of the Yo(a;) and Yi(a;) functions defined by 
Yo(a;) = J,{x) . log.x + (|)' - (1 + i) (|)'/ 2

Y,{z) = J,{x) . log,x - Jo{x)lx - I + (1 + ^) (|)'/1 ! 2 ! 

-(!+* + *) (|//2!3! + ... 

have been calculated by B. A. Smitb for x = 001 to 1-00 and 10 to 
10-2 to four places of decimals, and by J. R. Airey for x — 0-1 to 16-0 
to seven places. 

The following Tables have been computed from the relation 

Y„(a;) = (log 2 - y) J„(a;) - G„(x) 

and verified by the method of differences. 

The interpolation formulae for other values of the argument are 

Y.(x±*) = [l - *" ±1 ...]y.(x)+ [:FJ + ^^...]Y,W 



y,(. ± i, = [1 T * - * (1 - j„) . .] Y,(.) + [± A - 4 . .] Y,W.

The Neumann G Functions. 

The Neumann Functions Gr„(a;) of order greater than unity are of 
frequent occurrence in physical problems, such as the diffraction of light, 
pressure of radiation, &amp;c. Tables of the functions have been found from 
those of Go(a;) and Gi(a;) by {a) direct calculation and (6) logarithmic 
computation from the recurrence formula 

G„.i(a?) = - ^M - G-i(^) 

X 

and verified in the case when x is an integer by the relation 
Jn(«) G„„(x) - J„+i(a;) G„(a;) = . 

X 

The Bessel Functions J„(x) for positive integral values of n and x have 
been given by Meissel for x = 1 to a; = 24. 

The Tables may be used to calculate G„(x) for other values of the 
argument x by employing the following formula : 



G„(x + h) = G„(a;) + h g G„(x) - G„,,(x)1

ON THE CALCULATION OF MATHEMATICAL TABLES. 87 

Bessel Functions of Half-integral Order. 
The solution of the equation 

dx^ I X- J 

being taken in the symbolical form 

As- "• + Be^ 



"--■(-ii)" 



X 

yields as standard functions of real quantities 

a / \ n + \ ( \ d\" mix 

\ X dxj X 

with E„(x) = X" '^ ( - ^ ^^y I" '" = C" (a;) - i S„ (x) 

as an important associated function. 

The functions (E„ [x) f = (S„ (x) y + (C„ (.*;) y- 

(E,:{x)y = (&gt;ij{x)y-^{c„'(x)y 

are of importance, and have been tabulated with S„ (x), C„ {x), and their 
derivatives S„' (x), C„' {x). 

The connection with Bessel Functions is apparent from the differential 
equation, giving 

S„ (x) = s/ \vx J„ y 1 [x) 

From the differential equation, we obtain 

X 

S,/(x) = S„_i(x)-^'S„(x) 

X 

with corresponding formulse for C,,' {x), E,,' (a;). 

By elimination of S,/ (x), we get the recurrence formula 

^n.Ax)^—^- S„(a;)-S„_,(x).

Anomalous Rotatory Dispersion. 

During the year much justification has been found for the view 
expressed in the Eeport presented at Birmingham ' that a knowledge 
of the phenomena of dynamic isomerism is essential for the interpreta- 
tion of optical rotation, especially in the case of liquids which show 
anomalous rotatory dispersion,' and that ' the study of rotatory 



ON DYNAMIC ISOMERISM. 103 

dispersion will open up a new and fruitful field for the investigation of 
dynamic isomerism.' The importance of this aspect of the subject is 
«hown by the conspicuous part which it played in a general discussion 
on ' Optical Eotatory Power, ' held before the Faraday Society on 
March 27, 1914, to which the Chairman and Secretary of this Com- 
mittee contributed papers. Preliminary experiments, which will be 
described in a subsequent Eeport, have shown (1) that ethyl tartrate, 
the typical example of anomalous rotatory dispersion, is probably a 
mixture, and (2) that nitrocamphor, the typical example of dynamic 
isomerism, gives rise to anomalous rotatoiy dispersion in certain 
solvents. 

Dynamic Isomerism, Metavierism, Tautomerism, avd, Desmotropy. 

Attention has recently been directed {Proc. Chem. Soc, April 4, 
1914) to the importance of maintaining strict accuracy in the use of 
terms to describe the phenomena of reversible isomeric change. 

Briefly, it may be said that all the essential facts in reference to 
the conception of equilibrium between isomerides are set out in 
Butlerow's classical, but almost forgotten, paper, ' Ueber Isodibutylen ' 
(Annalen, 1877, 189, 44). The name dynamic isomerism was intro- 
duced in 1899 (Trans. Chem.. Soc, 75, 235) as a paraphrase of Butle- 
row's description of ' a condition of equilibrium depending on incessant 
isomeric change '; but the adjective isodynamic had already been sug- 
gested by Armstrong in 1889 {Watts' Dictionary, 'Isomerism') to 
describe those isomerides ' which change their type with exceptional 
facility in the course of chemical interchanges.' The word metameric 
had been used in this sense in 1833 by Berzelius to describe isomerides 
which were readily converted into one another, but the usefulness of 
the word was destroyed by a misguided attempt to transfer it to another 
usage. 

The hypothesis of tautomerism was introduced by Laar in 1885 
(Ber. 18, 648 ; 19, 730) to account for the facts which had already (a? 
time has shown) been explained adequately by Butlerow. Laar asserts 
that, in every case of tautomerism, the different formulae suggested 
by the reactions of the substance represent, ' not isomeric, but identical 
bodies '; the term cannot, therefore, be applied to any case of isomer- 
ism, however readily the isomerides may be converted into one another. 

It is impossible to say whether tautomerism exists ; but it has at 
least been proved by the work of Knorr that the two substances repre- 
sented by the formulae 

CH3-C0-CH,-C0,Et and CH3-C(0H) :CH-CO.Et 

are not tautomeric, but have a real existence as well-defined isomeric 
compounds, which only change into one another under definite physical 
and chemical conditions. 

The word desmotropy was introduced by Jacobson (Ber. 1887, 20, 
17.3^, footnote; 1888, 21, 2628, footnote) in 1887, when it had become 
evident that Laar's theory of tautomerism had brolien down in the 
very case to which it had been most frequently applied, namely, the 
labile isomerism which results from the contiguity of a double bond 
and an acidic hydrogen atom. Jacobson considered 'that the known 



104 REPORTS ON THE STATE OP SCIENCE. — 1914. 

forms of such compounds are to be represented by a definite grouping 
of atoms, which in certain reactions passes over into an isomeric group- 
ing by a rearrangement of bonds consequent upon the displacement 
of a hydrogen atom ' ; it was to express this view that the word ' desmo- 
tropy ' was introduced. If used in this sense, to describe the labile 
isomerism produced by the mobility of a hydrogen atom, it might be 
of real value; unfortunately the meaning of the word was tampered 
with by Hantzsch and Hermann (Ber. 1887, 20, 2802), and, as an 
inevitable consequence, it has become ambiguous, and has ceased to 
be clearly significant. 

Nearly all the cases to which the word ' tautomerism ' has been 
misapplied in recent years are examples of isomerism pure and simple, 
the only special feature being the fact that the isomerides can be 
converted into one another with greater or less ease. It is therefore 
very rarely necessaiy to use any other words than ' isomerism ' and 
' isomeric change ' to describe the phenomena. Isomeric compounds 
which owe their lability to a mobile hydrogen atom might well be 
distinguished as ' desmotropic ' but for the ambiguity arising from the 
ill-advised action of Hantzsch in attempting to extend the meaning of 
this term. At the present time the least ambiguous phrase that can 
be used to distinguish ethyl acetoacetate and its allies from the very 
much larger group of substances which exhibit ' dynamic isomerism ' 
or reversible isomeric change is to refer to them as examples of ' keto- 
enol ' isomerism, and in other cases to use some similar specific name, 
describing the nature of the two compounds between which a condition 
of equilibrium may exist. 

Isomeric Halogen-derivafives of Camphor. 

Another fruitful, though expensive, line of research has been opened 
out during the year by applying the process of dynamic isomerism to 
the preparation of new halogen-derivatives of camphor. A new 
isomeride has been prepared from a-chlorocamphor by acting on it 
with alkali. In order to produce a condition of dynam.ic isomerism in 
the liquid, and then arresting the isomeric change by the addition of 
acid. On freezing the alcoholic solution, most of the original substance 
crystallises out, and the mother-liquor contains the isomeric a-chloro- 
camphor. This melts at 117° (instead of 94°) and has ra]i,+41o 
(instead of +97°). As the new compound can be prepared readily 
on a large scale, it promises to be of great value in studying the type 
of dynamic isomerism in which a catalvtic r.gent must be added 
deliherately in order to bring about a condition of equilibrium between 
Isomers. The whole series of compounds which is now under investi- 
gation will provide valuable data for the study of dynamic isomerism 
and rotatory dispersion, and for the elucidation of the crystallographic 
structure of the camphor molecule. 

The Committee asks for reappointment with a grant of £40. An 
Increased grant is asked for to cover the heavy cost of the organic 
preparations referred to in the last section of the Report. 



ON THE TRANSFORMATION OF AROMATIC NITROAMINES. 105 

The Transformation of Aromatic Nitroamines and Allied 
Substances , and its Relation to Substitution in Benzene

The Acetylation of Anili)ies by Acetic A^ihydride in the presence of 

Catalysts. 

(With W. H. Gray, M.Sc.) 

The accelerating action of catalysts on the interaction of acetic anhy- 
dride and hydroxy- groups has long been known: it was first observed 
by Pranchimont^ in the acetylation of cellulose, and was later noted 
by numerous observers.* That catalysts had a similar effect in the 
action of acetic anhydride on the amino- gi'oup seems, however, to 
have been overlooked until Smith and Orton ^ made the discovery that 
negatively di-ortho- substituted anilines, such as s-tribromoaniline, can 
be acetylated at great speed at the ordinary temperature in the presence 
of sulphuric and other acids. 

Such anilines are particularly suitable for such an investigation as 
they react very slowly indeed with acetic anhydride at the ordinary 
temperature, and at higher temperature mainly yieFd diacetyl deriva- 
tives, Ar-NAcj; in the presence of a catalyst at low temperatures they 
yield, on the other hand, the monoacetyl derivative. Anilines with 
one ortho- position unoccupied form monoacetyl derivatives with such 
extreme ease that the presence of an acid is of no advantage, but, on the 
contrary, inhibits the reaction, most probably by forming stable saTts 
which do not react with acetic anhydride. 

Such salts as sodium acetate have long been known as catalysts of 
the acetylation of phenols. We have found that vai'ious salts have 
a similar effect in the case of amines. Ferric salts are as pre-eminent 
in this capacity as in the bromination of acetic anhydride and other 
compounds, which we are investigating. 

An early attempt (Smith and Orton, Joe. cit.) to throw light on the 
mechanism of such catalyses, using s-tribromophenol, demonstrated 
that acids varied greatly in catalytic effect; that the change was a re- 
action of the second order; that the speed was proportional to the 
concentration of the catalyst. 

To follow quantitatively the interaction of acetic anhydride and a 
di-ortho negatively substituted aniline has proved a very difficult 
matter. The small capacity for forming salts, which is an advantage 
in following the effect of acid catalysis on acetylation, is a barrier to 
the estimation of unchanged aniline by the diazo- method. Moreover, 
the slowness with which the anilide is hydrolysed equally prevents 
estimation of the extent of acetylation.

lOG REPORTS ON THE STATE OP SCIENCE, 

A most excellent method has now been devised for determining the 
amount of unchanged aniline. This consists in stopping the reaction 
by adding anhydrous sodium acetate, equivalent to the acid catalyst, 
followed by some excess of an acetic acid solution of nitric acid. The 
aniline is rapidly and quantitatively converted into a nitroamine 
(Orton'^; W. H. Gray ^). The nitroamine is completely extracted 
from the diluted solution by shaking three times with chloroform, and 
its quantity measured by titration of its alcoholic solution with baryta. 
The composition of the system could also be checked by direct estima- 
tion of the remaining acetic anhydride by the method devised by Orton 
and M. G. Edwards," and amplified by Orton and Marian Jones.' 
The amount of anhydride found at a given period of the reaction corre- 
sponded well with that calculated from the initial concentration on 
the assumption that the loss of anhydride was solely due to acetylation. 
The accuracy and the refinements of this method of analysing the 
system are mainly due to the exhaustive experiments of Mr. "W. H. 
Gray * on the stability of nitric acid in acetic acid solution and allied 
problems. The error in the estimation of the nitroamine in an acetic 
acid solution is not above J per cent. , whilst the error in the determina- 
tion of the aniline by conversion into nitroamine falls below 1 per cent. 

The velocity coefficients for a reaction of the second order are re- 
markably constant, in spite of the complicated and intricate analyses 
by which they are obtained.

ON THE TRANSFORMATION OF AROMATIC NITROAMINES. 107 

liydrolysed by water in the acetic acid medium, the initial coucentration 
was arrived at by deducting an amount equivalent to the water from 
the anhydride used. 

The experiments have led to some very interesting results: — 
. The reaction is of the second order; the value of the expression, 

- ~ — , is approximately halved by doubling the dilution. 

t \Qi — 3J) 

2. The speed is approximately proportional to the concentration of 
the catalyst when the concentrations of the aniline and anhydride are 
kept constant. 

3. A very remarkable effect was produced by variation of the 
concentration of the aniline, when anhydride and catalyst are kept 
constant. It would be expected that the speed of acetylation would fall 
on decreasing the concentration of the aniline; on the contrary, how- 
ever, the speed increases. A comparison of experiments A and B 
shows that on halving the concentration of the aniline the speed is 
roughly doubled. The most obvious explanation of the observation 
is that the acid catalyst is partly combined with the aniline. Such a 
balanced action would follow the equation of equilibrium: — 

[Aniline] [H2SO4] = K [anilinium salt]. 
rrr ci^ t t- [anilinium salt] 

[112804]= K^ -; — - — \ 

'- ^ *■■ [aniline] 

Since the proportion of the acid, and therefore of the salt, is very 
small in comparison with that of the aniline in these systems, the 
concentration of the acid is roughly inversely proportional to that of 
the aniline. The concentration of the free acid (or perhaps acid salt) 
is the dominant factor in the reaction, and hence the effect (if there 
be one) of the decrease of the aniline is completely concealed. This 
suggestion is made more probable by the effect of simultaneous reduc- 
tion of the concentration of both acid and aniline ; the velocity of acety- 
lation is scarcely changed (Exp. C). It appears, then, that the speed 
of acetylation is independent (within certain limits) of the concentra- 
tions of the acid and aniline, provided that these quantities remain in 
the same ratio. 

The action of the catalyst probably lies, as has been frequently 
suggested, in producing an ' active modification ' of the acetic anhy- 
dride, which alone reacts with the aniline. The evidence, so far as it 
goes, points to the reaction of the anhydride and catalyst being momen- 
tary, whilst that of the ' active ' form and the aniline is a time reaction. 
Too much stress cannot be put upon the fact that the reaction was of 
the second order, for the excess of anhydride was considerable. The 
combination of the acid with the aniline, moreover, obscures the issue, 
and renders a decision difficult with an acid catalyst. 

A complete account of this research will be published in one of 
the usual chemical journals.

Mr. A. D. Hall (Chairman), Dr. E. F. Armstrong 
(Secretary), Professor H. E. Armstrong, Professor F.

WoBK is being continued along the lines indicated in former reports. 

The further investigation of the distribution of oxydases (per- 
oxydase) in the flowers of Primula sinensis has led to the discovery 
that in certain white-flowered races which breed true to whiteness 
the peroxydase has a definite zonal distribution. Such white-flowered 
races, when crossed with coloured forms, yield in the Fj generation 
a certain number of plants having flowers which exhibit a colour pattern 
of a similar zonal character. Hence this pattern may be referred to 
a lack of uniformity in distribution of the peroxydase constituent of 
the colom'-forming mechanism, not of the chromogen. This investiga- 
tion has involved the study of a large number of plants of known 
genetic constitution and of their progeny ; it may be expected that 
eventually it will throw light on the phenomena of flaking and colour 
pattern in flowers. 

Concurrently with the study of the distribution of oxydases in 
plants, the occurrence of reductases has also been investigated, using 
this term as a general expression for substances which exert a re- 
ducing action. After many trials, partial success has been achieved 
by the discovery of agents indicative of such compounds, and evidence 
of the zonal distribution of reductases has been obtained. 

A general summary of the bearing of chemical observations on 
genetic constitution and the relation of enzymes to colour inheritance 
in plants was given before the Linnean Society in March, when it 
was particularly pointed out that, in life, interaction takes place 
between substances in pairs, the one being oxidised and the other 
reduced. Consequently the same interaction is often recorded whether 
oxydase or reductase be indicated by the agent used. This conception 
materially simplifies the study of the oxidative changes in plants. 

The formation of red pigments from yellow flowers by reduction 
and subsequent oxidation described in the last report has been further 
studied during the year. To elucidate the precise nature of the change 
by working with material of known structure, the experiments were 
extended to quercetin, \\hich has been reduced under a variety of 
conditions. As a rule, colourless compounds are formed which become 
red on exposure to the air or on the addition of hydrogen peroxide. 
The problem has been investigated independently at Beading by 
A. E. Everest (' The Production of Anthocyanins and Anthocyanidins, ' 
Proc. Roy. Society, 1914, 87 B. 144), who finds that the change from 
yellow to red may be effected by i-eduction alone, and that reduction 
takes place quite readily without the occurrence of hydrolysis. As 
Willstatter has now directed his attention to the chemical structure 
of the anthocyanic class of pigments, it is not proposed to continue 
the research in this direction. 

A study has been made of the rate at which various carbohydrate 
solutions are able to decolourise methylene blue in alkaline solution. 



ON THE STUDY OF PLANT ENZYMES. 109 

as this iiifcthod is of value in discriminating between glucose and 
fructose (compare Muster and Woker, Pfliigers Archiv, 1913, 155, 92). 
On adding a f6w drops of methylene blue to a freshly prepared solution 
containing one per cent, of the carbohydrate, together with half of one 
per cent, of solution of sodium hydroxide, the blue color is almost 
immediately discharged in presence of fructose, but only after a certain 
interval — 15 minutes — by glucose. After standing, the glucose solu- 
tion acts much more rapidly, whereas the fructose is less active than 
at first. Most probably the active agent is the enolic form common 
to Both sugars; as Lobry de Bruyn was the first to show, this is 
formed from both by the action of alkali. The possibility of the 
formation of fructose from glucose and vice versa in this manner in 
the plant must not be overlooked. The methylene blue test has been 
applied to a number of carbohydrates, so as to compare their rela- 
tive rates of enolisation. Indigo-blue solution, which changes from 
green to red, and finally to yellow, as it is reduced, is an equally 
sensitive agent. In all cases, agitation with air restores the colour; 
the colour is not destroyed in faintly acid solution. 

The behaviour of lipase has been further studied during the year. 
It has been shown tEat synthesis takes place under the influence of 
the enzyme to the greatest extent in the absence of all but traces 
of water, and that the presence of even a small proportion of water 
greatly favours action in the reverse direction.^ 

In view of the presence of ammonia in the nodular growths appear- 
ing on the roots of Leguminosae, it appeared probable that 
the enzyme urease would be found in these. It has been detected 
in the nodules from Lupins and a number of other Leguminosae. 
Attempts to detect the enzyme in organisms cultivated from the 
nodules have thus far been attended with negative results. 

Mr. Benjamin, working at the Hawkesbury Agricultural College, 
near Sydney, Australia, has detected urease in nodules from several 
Australian plants, including wattles ; also on tubercles derived from 
the Cycad Macrozamia spiralh. He has found urease also in the seeds 
of Abrus precatorius.

EoDD. 

In the first of these it is shown that the method of treatment 
introduced hy Barlow and Pope is applicable to a large number of 
derivatives of benzenesulphochloride or bromide of the formula 
CgHgE, . SOoCl, E being an atom of halogen. When equivalence 
parameters are calculated from the axial ratios and the valency volume, 
in nearly thirty cases the values found of two of the parameters are 
all but identical with those of the corresponding parameters of benzene, 
the third parameter being increased by the same amount beyond the 
benzene value by the introduction of the sulphonic radicle. Hence 
it is to be supposed that the halogens have the same relative valency 
volume as hydrogen in all the compounds considered. Numerous 
other cases are quoted in support of the conception of valency introduced 
by Barlow and Pope. 

In the second communication data are given for various derivatives 
of benzenesulphochloride containing but one atom of halogen. It is 
shown that these fall into line with the di-derivatives. 

In the third attention is called to crystallographic peculiarities 
presented by substituted benzenesulphonates of dyad metals and a close 
relationship to corresponding toluenemephonates is established. The 
influence of water of crystallisation is considered. 

Attention is specially directed also to the peculiar behaviour of 
certain isomorphous salts of iron, cobalt and nickel in the magnetic 
field. When suspended similarly in either of two axial directions, 
corresponding isomorphous iron and cobalt salts always act along 
crystallographic axes at right angles to each other. Nickel salts 
behave like cobalt salts when suspended in the one axial direction, 
like iron salts when suspended in the other. Apparently the difference 
in the behaviour of the various salts is to be referred to magnetic 
peculiarities in the metallic atoms. 



Stuchj of Soluhility Phenomena. — Interim Report of the Com- 
mittee, consisting of Professor H. E. Aemstbong {Chairman) , 
Dr. J. Vargas Eyre (Secretary), Dr. E. F. Armstrong, 
Professor A. Findlay, Dr. T. M, Lowry, and Professor 
•W. J. Pope. • • ... 

Much of the time since the appointment of this Committee has been 
devoted to setting up the required apparatus and getting it into working 
order in a new laboratory. Materials have been purified and work 
has been done to ascertain within what limits solubility determinations 
were trustworthy u-nder the new conditions. 



ON THE STUDY OF SOLUBILITY PHENOMENA. Ill 

Preliminary trials have been made to ascertain the influence of 
isomeric alcohols on the solubility of salts in water at 25° C. Small 
differences have been observed in the precipitating effect of the butylic 
alcohols, and work is now in progress to determine the variations in 
solubility of the chlorides of potassium, sodium and ammonium brought 
about by the addition of small quantities of the isomeric propylic, 
butylic and amylic alcohols. 

It is desired that the Committee be reappointed. 



Erratic Blocks of the British Isles. — Report of the Committee, 
consisting of Mr. E. H. Tiddeman (Chairman), Dr. A. E. 
DwERRYHOUSE {Secretary), Dr. T. G. Bonney, Mr. F. W. 
Harmer, Eev. S. N. Harrison, Dr. J. Hornb, Mr. W. 
Lower Carter, Professor J. W. Sollas, a)id Messrs. W. 
Hill, J. W. Stather, and J. H. Milton. 

The Committee reports that owing, probably, to the early date of 
the meeting no lists of erratics have been 'Contributed during the year, 
and in consequence no part of the grant has been expended. 
The Committee seeks reappointment with a grant of 5?. 



The Preparation of a List of Characteristic Fossils. — Second 
Interim Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor P. 
F, Kendall (Chairman), Mr. W. Lower Carter (Secretary), 
Mr. H. A. Allen, Professor W. S. Boulton, Professor G. 
Cole, Dr. A. E. Dwerryhouse, Professors J. W. Gregory, 
Sir T. H. Holland, G. A. Lebour, and S. H. Eeynolds, 
Dr. Marie C. Stopes, Mr. Cosmo Johns, Dr. J. E. Marr, 
Dr. A. Vaughan, Professor W. W. Watts, Mr. H. Woods, 
and Dr. A. Smith Woodward, appointed for the considera- 
tion thereof. 

No meeting of the Committee was held during the year, but numerous 
suggestions for a list of fossils were received. From these a provisional 
list was compiled by the Secretary, and uncorrected were printed and 
circulated. This provisional list, when revised, will, it is hoped, form 
the basis for the publication of an amended list of fossils next year. 
The Committee ask for reappointment with a grant of £10. 



Geology of Ramsey Island, Pembrokeshire. — Final Report of the 
Committee, consisting of Dr. A. Strahan (Chairman), Dr. 
Herbert H. Thomas (Secretanj) , Mr. E. E. L. Dixon, Dr. 
J. W. Evans, Mr. J. F. N. Green and Professor 0. T. Jones.

aid Mr. J. Pringle in continuing his researches in the west of Pembroke- 



112 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 

aliire has been spent. They have also to report that the detailed 
mapping of the island has been completed. The examination of the 
rocks and fossils which have been collected will be proceeded with. 

For the purpose of description the island can be divided conveniently 
into two areas — a northern area composed of Lingula Flags, Arenig 
mudstones and shales, Lower Llanvirn, and the intrusive mass of Carn 
Ysgubor; and a southern area of Lower Llanvirn shales with inter- 
bedded tuffs and rhyolites, and a thick mass of intrusive quartz- 
porphyry. To the latter area belongs the mass of rhyolitic and brecciated 
tuffs of Carn Llundain. 

Northern Area. 

Lingula Flags. — The Lingula Flags consist of bluish-grey flaggy, 
micaceous shales with ribs of hard grey close-grained sandstone, some 
of which reach a thickness of two feet. They occupy the headland 
of Trwyn Drain-du, and they extend eastwards to Bay Ogof Hen, while 
on the eastern side of the island they form the cliffs from tlie north- 
east corner to Road Uchaf. The Flags also occur in the headland to 
the south of Aberma\vi". They are highly fossiliferous, and yield Lingu- 
lella davisi in great abundance. 

Arenig. — All the zones of the Arenig are present. The lo\\est beds 
are bluish-grey sandy mudstones and shales with Ogygia selivyvi, Orthis 
proava, and 0. inenapice. They are confined to the north-east corner 
of the island, and are faulted against the Lingula Flags. The mud- 
stones are followed by bluish-black shales belonging to the Extensus 
Zone, and are well displayed in the cliffs at Eoad Uchaf and Eoad Isaf. 
Similar shales belonging to the Hirundo Zone are present in Abermawr. 

Lower Llanvirn. — The base of the Lower Llanvirn is seen only in 
the cliffs in Abermawr, where the shales of the Hirundo Zone are 
succeeded by a thick series of hard dark- and light-coloured tuffs of fine 
texture, which yield Didyinograptus bifidus in their highest beds. The 
tuffs are followed by fossiliferous blue-black shales, but their full 
thickness is not seen in the northern area. 

Intrusive Rocks. — Carn Ysgubor is formed of an intrusive mass of 
quartz-albite-diabase, which has invaded the sediments of Ix)wcr Llan- 
virn, Arenig, and Lingula Flags. A small intrusion occurs south of 
Abermawr, where Lingula Flags are in contact with a quartz-kerato- 
phyre. 

Southern Area. 

This area was described in the first report, in which it ^^•as shown to 
be composed of D. bifidus shales whicli had been invaded by a thick 
mass of quartz-porphyry. The shales, well displayed in the cliffs 
of Forth Llauog and Foel Fawr, are highly fossiliferous, and a large 
collection of graptolites has been made from them. They contain 
layers of coarse agglomeratic tuff, and at Foel Fawr pass upwards 
into thick beds of tiiii which are conformably overlain by grey rhvolites. 
The tuffs and conglomerate on Carn Llundain belong to the same period 
of eruption. 



ON GEOLOGY Of RAMSEY ISLAND, PEMBROKESHIRE. il3 

The two points of interest, therefore, which were made the object 
of mapping the island have been successfully solved. It has been found 
that the so-called Tremadoc beds are Ai'enig sediments, and that they 
do not pass downwards into the Lingula Flags, but are brought against 
them by a fault; also that the rocks hitherto regarded as pre-Canibrian 
belong to a period of igneous activity that occun-ed in Lower Llanvirn, 
or even later, times. 

It is hoped that the full description of the district will be completed 
this year, and it is the present intention of Mr. J. Pringle to com- 
municate the results of his investigations to the Geological Society of 
London. 



The Old Red Sandstone Rocks of Kiltorcan, Ireland. — Interim 
Report of Committee, consisting of Professor Grenville Cole 
(Chairman), Professor T. Johnson {Secretary), Dr. J. W. 
Evans, Dr. K. Kidston, and Dr. A. Smith Woodward. 

Owing to the early date at which this year's Eeport is required, and 
the absence of Professor Johnson at the Australian Meeting, it is im- 
possible to utilise the funds available for field-work, which normally 
is carried on during the long vacation. 

Your Committee asks for its reappointment, and for the renewal of 
the grant of lOL not utilised in 1913-14:, together with the unexpended 
balance of 9L odd. 

Two papers have been published during the past year : — T. Johnson : 
1. Ginkgcphyllum Kiltorkense sp. nov. ; 2. Bothrodendron Kiltorkense 
Haught. sp., its Stigmaria and Cone (' Sci. Proc, K. Dublin Society,' 
vol. xiv.). 



Stratigrapliical Names. — Interim Report of the Committee, con- 
sisting of Dr. J. E. Mark (Chairman) , Professor Grenville 
Cole, Mr. Bernard Hobson, Dr. J. Horne, Professor 
Lebour, Dr. A. Strahan, Professor W. W. Watts, and 
Dr. F. A. Bather (Secretary), appointed to consider the pre- 
paration of a List of Stratigrapliical Names used in the British 
Isles, ill connection with the Lexicon of Stratigraphical 
Names in course of preparation hy the International Geological 
Congress. 

At its Meeting in Stockholm, 1910, the International Geological Con- 
gress appointed a Committee to produce a ' Lexique international de 
Stratigraphie. ' The convener of this International Committee is 
Dr. Lukas Waagen, of Vienna, and the Secretary of the present Com- 
mittee had the honour of being appointed representative of Great 
Britain. 

Before the Meeting of the International Geological Congress in 
Toronto, 1913, various proposals were discussed by the members of 
1914. I 



114 REPORTS ON THE STATE OP SCIENCE. — 1914. 

the International Committee, and a provisional Eeport was laid before 
the International Congress. Unfortunately neither Dr. Waagen nor 
Dr. Bather were able to attend the Congress in Toronto, and up to the 
date of writing they have received no official communication from the 
officers of the Congress. It is, however, understood that the Congress 
can grant no subvention to aid the work. 

The situation, therefore, may be thus summarised: — The Inter- 
national Congress has appointed a Committee to produce a laborious and 
costly woi'k of undoubted value to all interested in Geology and the 
allied sciences. There are no funds for this purpose. The details 
of the scheme, even if decided on at the Congress, are not yet known 
to the present Committee of the Association. 

Consequently your Committee has been unable to take any steps, 
although some of its members have made note of stratigraphical names 
observed in the course of their ordinary work, and are prepared to 
continue this practice and eventually to place such material at the 
disposal of the International Committee. Your Committee is, however, 
well aware that the search for names must be conducted systematically, 
and it considers that funds will be needed to pay searchers and com- 
pilers. A gi'ant is not asked for at present, merely because it is not yet 
possible to draw up a plan of operations. 

The fact that this Eeport will be presented to the Association when 
meeting in Australia leads your Committee to point out that it has 
been appointed to consider names used in the British Isles, and that 
no provision has yet been made for the other constituents of the British 
Empire. As regards India, indeed, the work has been accomplished by 
Sir Thomas Holland and Mr. G. H. Tipper in their ' Indian Geological 
Terminology.'^ But it is desirable that other Committees should be 
formed, and the ])resent occasion seems appropriate for the establish- 
ment of one to deal with Australasia. Any such Committees would 
communicate directly with Dr. L. Waagen (K.k. geolog. Eeichsanstalt, 
Wien). 

Your Counnittee asks for its reappointment, for the present without 
a grant. 



Faiuia cnid Flora of the Trias of the Westciii Midlands. —Report 
of the Committee, consisting of Mr. G. Barrow (Chairman), 
Mr. Li/ J. Wills (Secretary), Dr. J. Humphreys, Mr. W. 
Campbell Smith, Mr. D. M. S. Watson, and Prof. W. W. 
Watts. 

This Committee regrets that owing to the early date at which the 
report has to be submitted this year, very slight progress has been 
made with the digging operations in Warwickshire and Worcestershire. 
Some hundred and more specimens have been obtained from the 
Arden Sandstone at Shelfield, near Alcester, and Hunt End, near

Redditch, including the bones and teeth of Lahyrinthodon, teeth of 
Polyacrodus and Phcebodus (?), plant remains, &amp;c. 

Permission has already been obtained to work in the famous Coton 
End Quarry at Warwick, and arrangements made for further digging 
at Shelfield should the grant be renewed. It is felt that the chief 
difficulty is the discovery of productive fossiliferous horizons, and then 
the arrangement for labour in scattered and often secluded localities. 
The larger part of the money so far spent has been in travelling 
expenses in this connection. 



The Lower Palceozoic Rocks of England and Wales. — Report 
of the Committee, consisting of Prof. W. W, Watts (Chair- 
man), Prof. W. Gr. Fearnsides (Secretary), Prof. W. S. 
BouLTON, Mr. E. S. Cobbold, Mr. V. C. Illing, Dr. C. Lap- 
worth, a7id Dr. J. E. Mark, appointed to excavate Critical 
Sections therein. 

Nuneaton Area. — Mr. V. C. Illing reports that during the winter of 
1913-14 and the ensuing spring, systematic trenching was begun 
aci'oss the outcrop of the Abbey Shale division of the Stockingford 
Shales. By the kind permission of Mr. Phillips, of Ansley Hall, the 
work was carried out in the Hartshill Hayes. A trench, thirty yards 
long, two feet wide, and three feet deep, was made in the direction of 
the dip of the shales, and cross trenches were cut along the strike 
of nine of the beds richest in fossils. In some cases these latter 
trenches were cut to a depth of ten feet. About thirty yai'ds away, 
in the direction of the strike, a second trench was cut aci'oss the out- 
crop, and, in addition to the discoveiy of further types of fossils, 
evidence was obtained of lateral changes in lithology. Some five 
thousand specimens were obtained, chiefly of trilobites, ranging over 
some fifty different species. These indicate a fauna corresponding to 
that of the Upper Solva Beds and the Lower and Middle Menevian 
Beds, i.e. the zones of Conocoryphe e.vsvlans, Agnostus farvijrons, 
Conocoryphe csqualis (?), and Paradoxides davklis, of Sweden, and the 
zones of P. aurora, P. Jiieksii, and P. davidis, of South Wales. In 
addition new links have been found between the fauna of this area 
and that of the corresponding beds in Bohemia, three of the forms 
being new to Britain. The fossils are being described and photo- 
graphed, and a paper on the subject will be presented to the Geological 
Society. 

Comley Area, ShropsJiire. — Mr. E. S. Cobbold reports that exca- 
vations have been begun in the Cambrian Rocks of the Comley area, 
but no report of the results is yet possible. 

The Committee asks for reappointment with a grant of 15?., which 
would include the unspent portion of this year's grant.

116 REPORTS ON THE STATE OP SCIENCE. — 1914. 



The Upper Old Red Sandstone of Dura Den. — Report of the 
Committee, consisting of Dr. J. Horne (Chairm^an), Dr. 
T. J. Jehu (Secretary), Mr. H. Bolton, Mr. A. W. E. Don, 
Dr. J. S. Flett, Dr. B. N. Peach, and Dr. A. Smith Wood- 
ward, appointed to conduct the further exploration thereof ; 
with a separate report by Dr. Smith Woodward oyi the 
Fish Remains. 

Since the preliminary report was presented at the Birmingham 
Meeting the excavations for fossil fishes at Dura Den have been com- 
pleted and the ground has been levelled. The Committee desire 
again to acknowledge the courtesy of Mr. Bayne-Meldrum, of 
Balmungo, the proprietor, who gave great facilities for carrying out 
the operations. They wish also to express their obligations to Mr. E. 
Dunlop, from Dunfermline, who superintended the work on the spot 
and who took a series of excellent photographs of the best specimens 
of fossil fishes. 

At the outset brief reference may be made to the geological struc- 
ture of the ground near Dura Den. Strata of Upper Old Eed Sand- 
stone age underlie the long depression of the Howe of Fife, which 
ranges westwards from St. Andrews Bay, between the slopes of the 
Ochil Hills on the north and the heights of the Carboniferous 
rocks with their intrusive masses on the south. The actual junction 
with the Lower Old Eed Sandstone volcanic series of the Ochils 
is hidden everywhere by drift, but the line of contact is evidently an 
unconformable one. For the sheets of andesite dip south-east 
at angles of about 15°, and are overlapped at different horizons by 
the more gently inclined members of the Upper Old Eed Sandstone. 

In Central Fife there is a conformable passage from the Upper Old 
Eed Sandstone into the Lower Carboniferous strata. But in Eastern 
Fife the top of the Upper Old Eed Sandstone is cut off by a fault 
which crosses Dura Den in a north-easterly direction and brings down 
the Carboniferous strata on the south-east side. 

The ravine of Dura Den has been cut by the Ceres Burn since the 
Ice Age. This rivulet is formed by the union of a number of smaller 
streams which rise in the Carboniferous area of Fife. The Den has 
been excavated across the line of fracture and is about a mile and a 
half in length (see Fig. 1). 

Below the mouth of the Den the Ceres Burn enters the alluvial 
plain of the Eden and joins that river about a mile above the village 
of Dairsie. Dura Den is eroded in the Lower Carboniferous and Upper 
Old Eed Sandstone fonnations. For a distance of several hundred 
yards the Upper Old Eed Sandstone strata are laid bare in the channel 
of the stream and in a range of picturesque cliffs on either side. The 
section runs along the strike of nearly horizontal beds, so tliat only a 
comparatively small thickness of rocks is exposed. These belong 
to the upper part of the formation, but the actual top, as already

ON THE UPPER OLD RED SANDSTONE OF DURA DEN. 119 

indicated, is cut off by the fault, near which the Lower Carboniferous 
strata are seen dipping at angles of 35° to 40° to the south-east. The 
rocks consist of yellow, red, and greenish sandstones, with bands of 
clay or marl, and are nearly horizontal. They are rather fine-grained, 
somewhat fissile, and, in places, extremely false-bedded. 

Remains of fishes in the Upper Old Eed Sandstone of Fife were 
first observed in 1831 at Drumdryan, near Cupar, by the Rev. John 
Fleming. The scales detected by him were found to occur more 
abundantly at Dura Den, a mile farther east, and entire fishes were 
obtained there, preserved in the sandstone. 

For years the Rev. Dr. Anderson worked at these beds and pub- 
lished numerous papers descriptive of the region. The fish-remains 
obtained from time to time at this famous locality were examined and 
described by Agassiz, Huxley, and other investigators. The excava- 
tions were carried on partly under the guidance of a Committee of 
the British Association, which gave its first report in 1860. 

The remains occur as carbonised impressions on the fine-grained 
pale-yellow stone, and sometimes are to be found crowded together. 
Sir A. Geikie has remarked that ' the Dura Den sandstone does not so 
much mark a definite palfeontological subdivision as an exceptional 
area where the organisms were rapidly killed and buried in gi'eat 
numbers.' ^ 

On the other hand, Dr. Traquair correlated the Dura Den fish fauna 
with that of the highest subdivision of the Upper Old Red Sandstone 
on the south side of the Moray Firth. Dr. Traquair's list of fishes 
found at Dura Den during the earlier excavations is given below : - 

Bothriolepis hydrophila, Ag. 
Phyllolepis concentrica, Ag. 
Glyptopomus minor, Ag. 
Glyptopomus hinnairdi, Huxl. 
Gyroptychius heddlei, Traq. 
Holopiychius fle7ningi, Ag. 
Phaneropleuron andersoni, Huxl. 

In the spring of 1912 the Dundee local Committee of the British 
Association Isegan excavations with the view of re-exposing the fish-bed 
at Dura Den. Tlie work was carried on under the supei-vision of 
Mr. A. W. R. Don. The exact site of the previous diggings was un- 
known, hut, according to local tradition, many of the first specimens 
had been obtained from the sandstone forming the bed of the stream 
and from an excavation on the left side between the stream and the 
mill-lade. After some trial explorations the fish-bed was eventually 
struck, and part of the old workings was exposed. The latter lay 
30 feet to the west of the stream, just opposite the north end of the 
garden belonging to the house known as ' The Laurels, ' now in the occu- 
pation of Dr. Graham Campbell. A pit was opened from the base of 
the old workings in the direction of the mill-lade, and the fish-bed 
was found to lie at a depth of nine feet from the surface. Only a small

part of the fish-bed was then worked. A few good specimens were 
obtained, and \Aere on view when the locahty was visited during one 
of the excursions an-anged in connection with the Geological Section of 
the British Association Meeting at Dundee in 1912. 

Work was resumed by our Committee on May 5, 1913, and pro- 
ceeded more or less continuously to the end of August 1913. The 
pit, opened in 1912, having been partly refilled, had to be cleared 
again. As stated in the preliminary report issued last year, a definite 
plan was followed in the excavations. The fish-bearing zone was un- 
covered and removed in successive sections (fig. 3). 

The sandstone layer, rich in fish-remains, is restricted to a zone 
about two inches thick. It lies at an average depth of nine feet from 
the surface, and is overlain by about four feet of comparatively barren 
sandstone, capped by about four feet of loose superficial materials. 
It was decided to work the fish-bed in the direction in which the fish- 
remains appeared to be most abundant. As the operations extended 
towards the mill-lade in the area marked A' in fig. 3, the sandstone did 
not yield fishes, as if the limit of the rich fish-bearing zone had been 
reached in that direction. The aiTangement was then made to carry 
on the excavations towards the stream and just north of the face of the 
old workings. 

The finest specimens of fossil fishes and the largest number were 
obtained in the middle section (area marked B in fig. 3) and in the 
immediately adjoining parts of the other two sections (A and C in 
fig. 3). The greater part of the area marked in fig. 3 proved to be 
somewhat disappointing, though one slab containing twenty specimens 
was found there and a fine example of Phijllolepis quite close to the 
stream. Good specimens, however, were scarce in section C outside 
the limit of the rich fish-bearing zone. In the north-east corner of 
it near the stream a sandstone layer with fragmentary fish-remains 
was traced for a short distance. 

It is worthy of note that large scales of Holoptychiiis were obtained 
m the sandstone three feet above the fish-bed, and that fish-scales in a 
fragmentary condition were found scattered throughout the sandstones 
above that zone. No fish-scales were detected below that horizon, 
although the excavations were continued downwards for nearly two 
feet beneath that zone. 

Fine examples of sun-cracks were seen in the sandstone at depths 
varymg from two to four inches below the fish-bed, and, at one 
locality, one mch above that horizon. This feature is suggestive, and 
probably points to desiccation as a cause of the death of '^ the fishes 
m a shoal at this locality. 

In all forty-two slabs of stone witli well-preserved fish-remains were 
obtained. These were photographed bv Mr. Dunlop, and the photo- 
graphs were sent to Dr. Smith Woodward for determination. About 
fifty fragmentary specimens were collected which were not photo- 
graphed. The whole collection has been stored in an adjoining mill 
under lock and key. 

The expenses connected with these detailed investigations have 
exceeded the British Association grant of 76/.. and the contribution of 



122 BEPORTS ON THE STATE OP SCIENCE. — 1914. 

121. from Mr. Bolton of the Bristol Museum. The Curator of Ichthy- 
ology in the American Museum of Natural History, New York, has 
offered a donation towards the expenses on condition that some of 
the specimens be given to that Museum. The Committee have accepted 
this offer. 

On June 19 the Chairman, the Secretary, Dr. Smith Woodward, 
and Mr. Dunlop visited Dura Den. Each specimen was then examined 
by Dr. Smith Woodward, and a scheme of distributing the fish-remains 
to various public institutions was adopted by the members of the 
Committee who were then present. The distribution will be carried out 
during this summer. 

The report of Dr. Smith Woodward is appended : 

Preliminary Report on the Fossil Fishes from Dura Den. 
By Dr. A. Smith Woodward. 

The very large majority of the fishes found during the excavations 
at Dura Den are examples of Holoptychius flem.ingi, and most of 
the slabs exhibit no other species. Specimens of Glyptopomus 
kinnairdi, Glyptopomus minor, Phancropleuron andersoui, and 
Bothriolepis hydrophila occur but rarely. All are neai'ly complete, 
as usual, having teen suddenly buried ; and it is probable that when 
studied in detail the new collection will make some small additions to 
our knowledge of the species represented. 

The only important novelty is a nearly complete specimen of 
Phyllolepis, which shows for the first time the arrangement of the 
dermal plates in this rare fish; and apparently determines its affinities. 
The genus has already been recorded from Dura Den,^ but it is known 
only by detached plates. The armoured portion of the fish is oval in 
shape and depressed, so that the fossil is exposed from a:bove or 
below. The surface shown is covered chiefly with two large plates, 
one behind the other, each irregularly hexagonal in shape and slightly 
broader than long. The anterior plpte is somewhat the smaller and 
narrower, and the regularity of its concentric ridge-ornament is inter- 
rupted by waviness in lines apparently of slime-canals which radiate 
s}^mmetrically from the centre to the periphery. The posterior plate 
is ornamented exactly like the imperfect typical plate of Phyllolepis 
concentrica from Clashbennie.* Eound the anterior plate are arranged 
four pairs of small plates, which decrease in width forwards. Their 
ridge-ornament is peculiar in being concentric only with two or three 
of the margins of each plate and running out at right-angles to the 
inner margin. The postero-lateral plate is long and narrow and much 
the largest, extending along the posterior two-thirds of the anterior 
median plate. The next plate forwards, also long and narrow, is 
much less than half as large as the postero-lateral just described, -and 
the two pairs o' anterior plates are comparatively small. This series 
of plates on each side is continued behind by another still larger plate, 
which flanks somewhat less than the anterior half of the posterior 
median plate and ends postero-latorally in a produced angle or cornn.

ON THE UPPER OLD RED SANDSTONE OF DURA DEN. 123 

The ornamental ridges here radiate chiefly from the posterior cornu and 
the outer margin and are most widely spaced on the postero-internal 
part of the plate. No vacuities are observable in any of the plates, 
but all of the anterior pairs are crossed by slime-canals in continuation 
of the radiating canals on the anterior median plate. The total 
length of the fossil is 12.5 cm. 

The ornamentation of the posterior median plate of the specimen 
just described seems to justify its I'eference to the typical species, 
Phyllolepis concentrica, already known by imperfect plates from 
Clashbennie, Perthshire. It is also interesting to add that some of the 
other plates agree well with specimens found in association with 
P. concentrica in the Upper Devonian of Belgium.* The ornament of 
the anterior median plate corresponds with that of the so-called 
P. corneti,"' while both the ornament and shape of some of the lateral 
plates are essentially the same as those of the small plates named 
Pentagonolepis.^ The plates forming the lateral cornua do not appear 
to have been previously seen. 

The whole fossil is most suggestive of the ventral aspect of the 
curious Devonian Ostracoderms Drepanaspis ^ and Psammosteus.^ It 
agrees with Drepanaspis in showing two principal median plates one 
behind the other, though in Phyllolepis they are more nearly equal 
m size. It corresponds with Psammosteus in exhibiting a prominent 
pair of lateral cornua at the hinder end of the series of small marginal 
plates, opposite the middle of the posterior median plate. It differs 
from both in lacking separate small tessellated plates. There is, there- 
fore, not much doubt that Phyllolepis is a genus of Ostracoderms most 
nearly allied to the Drepanaspidee or Psammosteidse. 



Antarctic Whaling Industry. — Report of the Committee, con- 
sisting of Dr. S. F. Haemer (Chairman) , Dr. W. T. Calman 
(Secretary), Dr. F. A. Bather, Dr. W. S. Bruce, and Dr. P. 
Chalmers Mitchell, appointed to provide assistance jar 
Major G. E. H. Barrett-Hamilton's Expedition to South 
Georgia to investigate the position of the Antarctic Whaling 
Industry. 

By kind permission of the Trustees of the British Museum the Com- 
mittee arranged for Mr. P. Stammwitz, a taxidermist employed at the 
Natural History Museum, South Kensington, to accompany Major 
Barrett-Hamilton to South Georgia; and the greater part of the grant

placed at the disposal of the Committee has been expended in paying 
his salary and in making certain preliminary payments. He sailed 
wllh Major Barrett-Hamilton on October 6, 1913, and work was com- 
n.enced at South Georgia immediately after their arrival on 
November 10. 

Early in the new year news was received that Major Barrett- 
Hamilton had died suddenly at South Georgia on January 17, while 
his inquiries were in full progress. This unlooked-for event, which 
the Committee record with profound son-ow, naturally altered the 
entire prospects of the expedition. Mr. Stammwitz had no alternative 
but to return at once, and after making arrangements for the despatch 
of the specimens which had been collected, he took the first opportunity 
of leaving South Georgia, bringing with him the notebooks containing 
Major Ban'ett-Hamilton's observations. At the request of the 
Colonial Of&amp;ce, and with the approval of the Trustees of the British 
Museum, these notebooks have been placed in the hands of Mr. Martin 
A. C. Hinton for examination. It is hoped that the results of the 
work which Major Barrett-Hamilton had done before his death will 
thus not be entirely lost. The collections brought home comprise a 
very valuable series of specimens — in particular, flippers, complete sets 
of baleen, and other anatomical material from the blue whale, the 
common rorqual, and the humpback whale. These specimens have 
been presented to the Natural History Museum by Messrs. Chr. 
Salvesen &amp; Co., at whose whaling station they were obtained, and they 
should be of service in helping to decide the much-debated question 
whether these Antarctic whales are specifically identical with their 
northern representatives. 

A few birds were obtained at South Trinidad on the outward journey, 
and a certain amount of dredging and shore-collecting was done at 
South Georgia. The collection made includes marine invertebrates and 
fishes, bird-skins, plants, and a few insects and rock-specimens. These 
have been handed over to the Natural History Museum, where arrange- 
ments are being made to have them determined, and if necessary report-ed 
on, by specialists. 

At the request of the Meteorological Office, Mr. Stammwitz took a 
series of observations on sea-temperatures and ice-drift while at South 
Georgia, and these are now being utilised by the Office. 

The Committee wish to record their appreciation of the value of the 
assistance which was given to the expedition by Mr. J. Innes Wilson, 
Stipendiary Magistrate of South Georgia, Messrs. Chr. Salvesen &amp; Co., 
and Mr. Henriksen, the manager of their Leith Harbour Whaling 
Station, Messrs. Bryde &amp; Dahl, the Tonsberg Whaling Company, and 
other individuals and whaling companies connected with South Georgia. 

The amount actually expended is less by 151. than the total (901.) 
allotted to the Committee, and it is not proposed to apply for this 
balance. 



BELMULLET WHALING STATION. 125 



Belmullet Whaling Station. — Report of the Committee, consisting 
of Dr. A. E. Shipley (Chairman), Professor J. Stanley 
Gardiner (Secretary), Professor W. A. Herdman, Eev. W. 
Spotswood Green, Mr. E. S. Goodrich, Professor H. W. 
Marett Tims, and Mr. R. M. Barrington, appointed to 
investigate the Biological Problems incidental to the Belmullet 
Whaling Station. 

The Committee acting through Professor Herdman arranged with Mr. 
J. Erik Hamilton and Mr. E. J. Daniel, two post-graduate research 
students of the University of Liverpool, for the prosecution of their 
researches in 1913. They proceeded to Belmullet on June 25 and Mr. 
Hamilton remained until the end of the fishery. Mr. Daniel retired 
from the investigations on August 26, having been appointed to a post 
under the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. Mr. Hamilton's Eeport 
is appended. 

The Committee desire to express their thanks to Mr. R. M. 
Barrington for considerable financial assistance. They have been 
enabled owing to his generosity to arrange with Mr. Hamilton for 
the further prosecution of the work in 1914. They have now experi- 
ence with three investigators — Mr. Lillie, Mr. Burfield, and Mr. 
Hamilton — and they find that the annual expense is about 45Z. They 
attach great importance, both from the scientific and economic sides, 
to the further continuation of these investigations, and beg to apply 
for reappointment with a grant of 45L for the summer of 1915. 

Eeport to the Commiiiec by J. Erik H.\milton, B.Sc. 

I. — Introduciion. 

In June 1913 Mr. R. J. Daniel and I proceeded to the Blacksod 
Bay Whaling Station on Ai-delly Point, Blacksod Bay, Co. Mayo, 
Ireland, to continue the work carried on by Mr. S. T. Burfield, B.A. . 
in 1911.1 

The flensing plane was clearly visible by telescope from the hotel, 
and the whaling steamers are compelled to pass the Point whenever 
they come in. In consequence no whale escaped notice, as might 
otherwise have happened on account of the distance from the Station. 

Our first whale was examined on the morning after our arrival, 
i.e., on June 26, the last on September 9. As Mr. Daniel was 
appointed to a post under the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, he 
liad to leave Blacksod on August 26 for his new duties. Consequently 
the working up of the collections and the preparation of this Report 
have been left in my hands. 

I desire to express my heartiest thanks to Professor W. A. Herdman, 

' British Association Report, 1912, p. 145. 



126 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 

F.R.S., who has given advice and help of great value during the time 
which was spent in his Laboratory in working up the materials obtained 
To Captain Lorens Bruun and Mr. D. Bingham sincere thanks are 
due from Mr. Daniel and myself for the way in which they assisted us 
at the Station. We would alsO' wish to mention that on many occasions 
the men employed at the Station helped us in the most obliging manner. 
Two steamers continue to be used, both fitted with wireless tele- 
graphy, which is employed solely for communication between the boats. 
As a result of the possession of this apparatus, if one boat finds whales 
in numbers too great to be dealt with unaided, the other steamer may be 
called up to assist in making the most of a fortunate find. 

Burfield^ has stated the disadvantages of work at a commercial 
factory, and I wish to lay particular emphasis on the rarity with which 
really fresh whales are brought in. It is exceptional for a whale to be 
anything other than decomposing. Even in those sufficiently fresh to 
be fit for food the carcase is quite hot in the deeper parts owing to 
decomposition, while in the other cases carcases lying on the flensing 
plane fizzle and splutter wherever a cut in the blubber permits the 
internal gases to blow off. 

Sperm Whales are particularly obnoxious, as they are brought from 
considerable distances. They are frequently caught at Eockall, 240 
miles away, and they smell strongly of cuttlefish. In two Spemi 
Whales which we saw part of the intestine was blown out through 
the back of the animal by pressure of gases produced by decomposition, 
and from one specimen a great spout of blood and oil was projected 
with considerable force over one of the investigators. 

About thirty-eight Irishmen and fifteen Norwegians are employed 
when work is in full swing. Of the Irishmen one is timekeeper and 
another_ is second flenser, but all the other skilled workmen are 
Norwegians. 

The 1913 season was the best which the Blacksod Bay Whaling 
Company has had up to the present. Sixty-four whales were brought 
in. The whalemen state from their experience that in fine, calm 
weather the whales go far out for food, and it is the case that during 
the splendid weather of August very few were taken. But the largest 
number of whales for a given number of days was brought in between 
August 27 and September 9, when the weather was still fairly fine. 
Nearly three thousand barrels of oil were shipped to Glasgow, to which 
port all the produce of this Station is sent. There were also manu- 
factured about fifteen hundred bags of guano. 

All whale oils at present average 201. per ton ( = 5i barrels), 
sperm oil and spermaceti having fallen considerably since 1911. The 
oil is used for the manufacture of explosives, soap, &amp;c., with the excep- 
tion of the two sperm products. The oil of the Sperm Whale is used 
for lubrication only, while spermaceti is largely utilised in the manu- 
facture of church candles. 

Whalebone from Balcenoptera musculus and B. xihhaJdii is now 
65/. per ton. The baleen of Megaptera is of very inferior quality, 

' Op. clt., p. 146. 



BELMULLET WHALING STATION. 127 

while B. horeaiis yields whalebone of considerably greater value, 
although, since this is a small species, the plates are not of great 

length. 

The flesh of B. aibbaldii has an excellent flavour even when taken 
from a large specunen. As it is full of oil it must be soaked in salt 
water and vinegar for several hours before being used. If this pre- 
caution is observed, it is almost impossible to distinguish whale-meat 
from good quality of beef-steak. The flesh for food is generally cut 
from the lateral post-anal region. On the Japanese Stations the 
entire carcases of the whales taken are, or used to be, sold on the 
market for food, it being more profitable to dispose of the animals in 
this manner than to boil them down for oil and guano. In Norway 
also a considerable amount of whale-meat is utilised by butchers. It 
is usually salted as soon as the whales are flensed, and is seldom 
placed on the market in the fresh condition. On account of the 
extreme rapidity with which whales decompose very few of the 
Blacksod Company's whales could be used as food. 

The attempts to recover the glue from the water resulting from 
the various cooking processes applied to blubber, meat, &amp;c., have 
failed. The reason for the failure lies in the amount of steam which 
is required to evaporate down the solution. This steam coasmnptiou 
necessitates the use of so much coal that the expenditure is not 
covered by the price received for the glue which results from the 
process of evaporation. 

In whale-hunting the shot which is generally attempted is aimed at 
a point behind the pectoral fin, as the animal here presents a large 
target, and the cast-iron harpoon head, with its charge of blasting- 
powder, is most likely to prove fatal when exploded in the thoracic 
cavity. The shot, as a matter of fact, which explodes beside the 
vertebral column in an anterior position is the most fatal. "When this 
happens the uhale dies instantaneously. On the other hand, the 
harpoon may fail to explode. In this case nothing can be done at the 
moment except to let the harpoon line run out. The whale may 
rush along the surface or descend almost vertically. If a surface run 
is made the engines are put at full speed -ahead in order to avoid 
straining the harpoon rope, which is three-inch manilla cable. When 
the whale dives down there is serious risk of the rope snapping. 
One such case occurred to our knowledge during the 1913 seasoai. 
Only a few fathoms of cable were lost on this occasion, but at other 
times whales have been known to take out the whole of the three or 
four hundred fathoms attached to the harpoon, and then to break 
the line at the bow of the boat. The whale is very much exhausted 
after a deep dive such as this, and when it returns to the surface 
another harpoon is fired into it, which almost invariably proves fatal. 
Even if the rope is broken the animal is usually so fatigued that 
it is readily approached and secured. We were informed by a very 
experienced Norwegian whaler that it has happened that a steamer, 
having become fast to a wounded whale, has ' played ' it for as much 
as thirty hours before the coiip dc cjrcicc could be delivered. 



128 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 

II. — Numbers and Species taken at the Blacksod Bay Station in 1913. 
The number of whales taken in the 1913 season was sixty-four, 
as has been stated. Of these fifteen were brought in previous to our 
arrival; we therefore examined forty-nine. Five species came under 
our notice, in the following numbers : — 

Fiiiners {Balcenoptera musculus, L.) 37 

Blue Whales [B. sibbaldii, Gray) 4 

Sejhval (£. borealis, Lesson) 1 

H\iinpha,ck (Megaptera longimana, Knd.) 1 

Sperm Whales (Physeter macrocephalus, L. ) 6 

Of the fifteen taken before June 26, eleven were Finners and 
four Sperm Whales. 

III. — Measurements and Proportions. 

(See Tables at the end of this Eeport.) 

In continuing the series of measurements adopted by Burfield, 
who followed True,^ we found that in some cases it was not easy to 
determine the points from which measurements were taken, within 
six inches or a foot. We therefore fixed on a series of standards 
which enabled us to make measurements from corresponding points 
on every whale. These points I attempt to define as follows: — 

(1) Total length. Taken between a position opposite the end of 
the upper jaw to a point opposite the notch between the flukes, in 
a straight line. When, as in the case of our first two whales, and 
in the cases of those taken before our arrival, we obtained the Norwegian 
measurements, two points had to be observed : (a) that Norwegian 
feet are equal to 12^ English inches; (6) that the Norwegians measured 
to the tip of the lower jaw, which projects beyond the rostrum, and 
therefore an allowance must be made for this in reducing to ' total 
length ' according to our standard. Eighteen inches was the allow- 
ance made, and this was probably erring on the side of taking off 
too little rather than too much. 

(2) Tip of snout to anterior end of the groove between the spiracles. 
This line is quite sharply marked. 

(3) Tip of snout to posterior insertion of pectoral fin. Th's 
measurement and the next were taken on the dorsal side of the animal. 

(4) Tip of snuut to posterior insertion of dorsal fin. This fin 
slopes away behind as well as in front. The ' posterior insertion ' 
was therefore found in the following manner — a line being dropped 
from the apex of the dorsal fin, at right angles to the body, the 
point where it cut the outline of the body was taken as the posterior 
insertion of the dorsal fin. Apart from this method I do not think 
that any point of equal value in every specimen could have been 
found. 

(5) Tip of snout to centre of eye. 

(6) Centre of eye to a'nterior end of auditory slit. 

(7) Notch of flukes to posterior end of anus. 

(8) Notch of flukes to anterior margin of umbilicus, which was 
the most definite border of that area.

BELMULLET WHALING STATION.

Measurements oj the Pectoral Fin. 

(9) Length of anterior border. There is an eminence at the anterior, 
proximal end of the pectoral fin. Immediately anterior to this is a 
slight depression. The eminence marks approximately the position 
of the head of the humerus. Our measurement was taken from the 
tip of the flipper, along the anterior margin, to the centre of the 
eminence. 

(10) The posterior length was taken from the tip, along the 
margin, to the axilla. This measurement was not easy to take, as 
the flipper was almost always directed backwards and the axilla 
compressed. When this was the case the exact point of proximal 
measurement had to be found by judgment, as the size of the limb 
and the rigidity of the muscles attached to it entirely prevented any 
attempt at altering the attitude of the fin. 

(11) The median length was taken from the tip in a straight line, 
down the centre of the flipper, to a point on a line drawn through 
the axilla in such a manner as to carry on the outline of the body. 
In taking this measurement the idea was to estimate the extent to 
which the limb projects from the body. 

(12) The greatest breadth of the pectoral fin was generally found 
to be about half-way between the tip and the insertion. 

(13) The length of the dorsal fin was taken from the posterior 
insertion as defined above, and the anterior insertion, which could 
usually be found with moderate accuracy. This measurement cannot 
be regarded as more than approximate. 

The flukes had been cut off every whale before it was towed in, but 
on jB. iHusculu-s (No. 19) the right fluke had not been completely 
severed. Measurement gave 7 ft. 5 in. as the distance between tip 
of fluke and caudal notch. The spread of tlie flukes was therefore 
M ft. 10 in. 

Total Length.

As all the figures for 1913 are perceptibly smaller than the corre- 
sponding figures of Burfield for IQll, it suggests the probability that 
the larger whales are being killed off, although it would be useful 
to have the figures for other years in order to verify the diminution 
in size which appears to be taking place.

BEI.MULLET WHALING STATION. 131 

IV. — General Observations on the Varioiis Species. 

1. Finners (B. muscuhis, Gray). 

(a) Colouration. — None of the specimens of the Finner examined 
by us presented any remarkable colour variations. On very many 
animals white marks occurred in the pigmented areas, as noted by 
Burfield.'' Some of these seemed to be the scars left after Penella has 
dropped off. In many cases we found the sores which had been 
produced by the parasite, although the latter was not present. These 
sores presented the same appearance as the wounds in which the 
parasites were still fixed. 

Notes on individual specimens: — 

No. 10. — There were a few white patches on the tongue, which 
may have been the result of lesions, or due to mere absence of 
pigment. 

No. 11. — A pale, grey line, about three-eighths of an inch broad, 
but gradually widening, ran from the ear aperture upwards and 
backwards to a point level with the anterior margin of the pectoral fin, 
and about 9 in. above the level of the ear- hole. From here onwards 
it broadened out and swept round in a semicircle to the anterior 
margin of the pectoral. On the top of the head there was a triangular 
grey patch, having as apices the angle of the jaw, the nape at the 
level of the pectoral, and a point about half-way down the margin 
of the rostrum. 

No. 19. — The fcetus of No. 19, 16 ft. in length, displayed the same 
areas of colouration on the head as an adult. The dark colour of the 
body was defined in front by the same line sweeping back from the eye, 
through the ear, and down to the pectoral, while dorsally it was 
limited by another line curving backwards, and dorsally, from the 
eye. 

No 24. — The black colour extended in flecks from, the left as far 
as the mid-ventral line, in the region of the ventral furrows. 

No. 29. — The belly had a yellow tinge, but, as the animal was 
very decomposed, this was probably not the case during life, as, when 
they have been dead for some time, whales become very discoloured. 
There were streaks of black on the left side of the belly. 

There is always a certain amount of pigment in the more lateral 
and posterior furrows. In Nos. 41 and 42 this was specially well 
developed, extending almost to the mid-ventral line from the left 
side. The furrow region of No. 42 had also a number of pale purple 
stains in its pure white. These were due to the presence of blood 
in the cutaneous vessels, which appeared to be gorged. They 
resembled bruises, but the epidermis was undamaged. This whale 
displayed a few of the 'galvanised-iron ' markings which are charac- 
teristic of the Blue Whale. These were in the post-anal region. 
It had also several incised wounds in the belly, about 8 in. long, 
partlv healed, but still raw. No. 45 had a large island of black pigment 
on the posterior furrow region of the left side.

132 REPORTS ON THE STATE OP SCIENCE. — 1914. 

There are frequently extensive white patches on the dark area, 
caused by the chafing of the whale against the side of the steamer 
as it is being towed in. These, however, are easily distinguished from 
the naturally unpigmented areas. 

(b) Ventral Furrows. — In the Finner the number of pectoral furrows 
is exceedingly variable. We found a maximum of eighty-four, and a 
minimum of fifty-four. In nearly half of the cases a median furrow 
could be distinguished, the presence of which appears to have escaped 
notice up to the present. The number was estimated by finding the 
median furrow, and counting all those between it and the pectoral 
fin of the side which happened to lie uppermost. As the fin is 
approached the furrows become less marked, and it is not easy to 
discern the furrow nearest the fin. The skin in the axillary region 
is much folded longitudinally, which further complicates matters. 
By doubling the number of furrows thus counted and adding the 
unpaired median an estimate of the total number was made. The 
furrows in the smallest foetus (3 ft. 11 in.) were represented by 
mere lines, and could not be counted with accuracy. The folds of 
twenty-seven specimens were counted, of which twelve had no dis- 
tinguishable median furrow. The average depth of these furrows 
was about "68 in. (deduced from eight measurements), and the average 
horizontal distance between points above the middle lines of the same 
number of furrows was 1'85 in., varying from 1'37 in. to 1'96 in. These 
measurements were taken from a. portion of blubber lying on the 
plane and not stretched in any way. 

It is essential that the counting should always be made in the 
same position, as some of the folds do not run the whole length of 
the furrowed area. There does, however, appear to be a certain 
amount of uniformity in the folding, the shorter folds corresponding 
with each other in different whales, if not with absolute accuracy, nt 
any rate nearly so. 

(c) Tongue. — The coloiu' of the tongue as a whole is dark grey, 
but the area which is the morphological upper sm-face, which is 
distinguishable from the morphological lower surface, shades oft into 
pink towards the ' tip.' 

2. Blue Whales (B. sibbaldii, Gray). 
Colo7iration. — The only point to which I wish to draw attention is 
that there are some curious markings on the skin, especially ven- 
trally, but not confined to that aspect. These markings take the form 
of curved, darker and lighter lines radiating from a common centre. 
The area of such markings is about 8 in. long and 4 in. wide. Where 
there is a number of markings crowded together, the appearance of 
the skin forcibly reminds one of the pattern produced on the surface 
of ' galvanised iron.' These markings occur in considerable abundance 
on large areas O'f the skin. 

3. Sejhval (B. borealis, Lesson). 

E.rlprnal Cliaraciers. — The solitary example of this species taken 
was a female. Although a small species (this specimen was only 



BELMULLET WHALING STATION. 133 

46 ft. 7 in. long) it has a robust figure, and the dorsal fin is of great 
height as compared with that of the Finner. This specimen had been 
lying at the buoy from Thursday afternoon until it was hauled up 
on Saturday morning, and was therefore considerably decomposed. 
The dorsal surface was dark grey, as was also the post-anal area of 
the ventral surface. The pre- anal region was for the most part of 
white colour, asymmetrically arranged. There was a considerable 
amount of black blotching towards the left side of this area, and on 
this side the white area was continued backwards in a large patch. 
There was no white patch coiTesponding with this on the right side. 
The symphysis was pigmented, and here there was a whorled design 
similar to that on the skin of the Blue "Whale as described above. 
The upper lips and the lower side of the anterior end of the rostrum 
were nearly black, and were finely tuberculated. The inner (palmar) 
surface of the pectoral fins was pale, streaky, greenish grey, with 
black streaks intermingling with the less dark flecks. The right side 
was a dark grey, nearly black. This may have been due to the fact 
that the right side had been more exposed to the sun than the left side 
as the animal lay at the buoy. 

The ear aperture was small. The tongue presented an area which 
could be more readily recognised as the dorsal surface than in the 
case of the Finners. 

4. Humpback (Megaptera longimana, Eud.). 

External Ch&lt;iracters. — The form of the single specimen taken was 
robust, reminding one somewhat of the figure of the Sperm Whale. 
The dorsal fin was placed far back and was much falcated, and of 
moderate height. The colour was slate-chocolate, but very dark, 
almost black. Pure white, splashed, ring-like marks occurred on the 
lower jaw and on the dorsal side of the pect.oral fin. The outer sides 
of the right mandible and of the right upper jaw were white, but 
on the left only the inner sides were unpigmented. The ventral 
surface of the flukes was white. The ventral folds were few in 
number (23), and wide; running up the centre of each groove was 
a low ridge about "375 in. high, of triangular section. The folds 
were about 4 in. wide and 5 in. apart. The median fold, with the 
next on each side, also the fold next the right pectoral fin, were mere 
narrow grooves. 

There was a deep groove running from the angle of the jaw 
downwards and backwards to a point about one-third of the width 
of the pectoral fin from its anterior margin. Another groove ran 
from a point a little above and in advance of the termination of this 
groove to a point somewhat behind the posterior margin of the 
pectoral, and a little above it. Unlike the small external auditory 
aperture of the Balsenopterids the opening in this specimen was 
S in. long. The upper surface of the snout had the characteristic 
knobs of the species. In the mid-dorsal line there were five, the 
first being n in. from the tip of the snout, and tlie last l^ in. from the 
spiracle. The spaces bet\\eeii the knobs, running from the snout, were 
1&lt;H, .18, J'2.l, 23^ in. respectively. There were also two series of 



134 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 

lateral knobs, following the margins of the rostrum, nine on each side 
in a consecutive row. Inside these rows, at tlieir posterior ends, 
was a second series of four knobs on each side. The knobs of the 
inner, short row were set beside those of the outer row, forming 
l^airs with them. But the two sides were not symmetrical. Thus, 
if the knobs oi the outer row are numbered 1 to 9 from before back- 
wards, on the left side 7, 8, and 9 were paired, and there was a 
single knob of the inner row behind the termination of the outer 
series. On the right side 6, 7, 8, and 9 were paired, and 
there was no unpaired knob posteriorly. Several of the left-side 
knobs had a hair on the summit, which suggests that the knobs may 
be overgrown hair-papillae, and their arrangement does correspond 
fairly closely with the arrangement of the hairs of BalcBiioptera. On 
the symphysis there were four knobs on the right side and five on 
the left. In each case there was a vertical row of tliree. The knobs 
varied in size, a large one being 2 in. high and 4 in. across the base. 

The eye appears to be rather more movable than in Balcenoptera. 
The pectoral fin has an exceedingly irregular posterior margin. There 
were seven conspicuous elevations on it, varying in length from 
10 to 27 in. 

5. Sperm Whale (P. m-acrocephalus, L.). 

(a) External Characters. — Six specimens were examined. The 
general body-colour is pale greyish chocolate, rather more lead-like 
ventrally. Between the genital aperture and the umbilicus there is 
a splashed chevron-shaped mark of a pal§ grey colour. The apex 
is on tlie umbilicus, and directed forwards, the ' arms ' being about 
4 ft. apart at the tips. There are also irregular grey flecks all 
over the ventral surface. In some specimens the front of the head 
is barred horizontally with streaks which are almost white in colour. 
They are broadest in the middle and taper towards the ends. The 
whole of the head, and in particular the anterior, ventral, and lateral 
areas, have numerous weals and sucker marks which have been pro- 
duced by the arms and suckers of the cuttlefish, which are the main 
food of this species. As might be expected from the fact that the 
suckers of many of the molluscs are armed with chitinous teeth, the 
sucker marks take the form of rings of minute pricks. One such 
mark was 3| in. across. The fifth Sperm "Whale had a large patch 
of pure white on the umbilicus, and an extensive array of grey 
streaks on the left side, in addition to the grey chevron. 

(b) Spiracle. — In every case the left spiracle alone was functional. 
On the right side, however, afterthe blubber has been removed, there is 
a compressed cavity, approximately oval in shape, about 18 in. long 
and 10 in. wide, in the position corresponding with that of the obliterated 
right spiracle. The lining of this cavity is heavily pigmented with 
the same colour as the outer surface of the animal. There can be 
no doubt that this is the vestige of the right spiracle, although no 
passage was observed running backwards from it in the direction of 
the pharynx. 

(c) Mouth. — The palate and floor of the mouth have a general 
pale grey colour and have a large number of small grooves, about 



BELMULLET WHALING STATION. 135 

an inch in length, running longitudinally. On the palate of the fii'st 
Sperm Whale there were two large dark blotches. That on the left 
was about 8 in. long, that on the right 11 in. 

{d) Tongue. — The tongue of Physeter affords a striking contrast 
to that of a Mystacocete. It is an exceedingly hard, strong structure 
of comparatively small size, and very nearly occludes the throat as the 
animal lies on the plane with the jaw gaping open. The tongue 
stands up from the jaw to a height of about 2 ft., and, as viewed 
from the front, presents a smooth, round wall, like the side of a 
section of wide tubing. The upper surface is wrinkled, and in front is 
produced into a small projection, which appears to correspond with the 
tip of the normal mammahan tongue. From its structure the tongue 
would appear to be of use in preventing the ingress of water during 
respiration, but in the dead animal, at any rate, this very fact of its 
nearly closing the throat gives the impression that the organ would be a 
hindrance to the swallowing of large prey. That this cannot be the 
case, however, is apparent from the size of the cuttlefish which we 
found in the stomach of one specimen, as described in Section V. 

(p) Teeth. — Teeth occur in both jaws. Only those of the lower 
jaw can, however, be of much practical value in the capture of food, 
as the upper-jaw teeth are of small size, and often nearly covered 
with soft tissue. The lower-jaw teeth are about twenty in number 
on each side, and are arranged in pairs, but the two teelh of eadi 
pair are not exactly opposite to one another. 

Actual numbers of teeth in the different Sperm Whales examined : — 

right side 23 
19 
20 plus 2 „ 21 plus 1 

23 

21 

The two most anterior teeth of each side project somewhat for- 
ward, but the majority of the teeth are nearly vertical, being some- 
what recurved in most cases and having a slight inclination outward. 
The acuteness O'f the point is very variable, but this may be merely due 
to differences in age of the animals. One tooth was seen which 
had been broken off, but the stump did not appear to be at all decayed. 
In the palate there is a hollow coiTesponding with each tooth of the 
lower jaw, into which the latter fits when the mouth is shut. 

The upper-jaw teeth are small, inclining backwards, and deeply 
embedded in soft tissue, but they do have some little use, as is 
demonstrated by the fact that in many cases they are much worn 
down by contact with the lower-jaw teeth. The most posterior of 
the latter are also very small, and of little use, occurring very far 
•back. There were no teeth in Ihe upper jaw of Nos. 16 and 26.

136 REPORTS ON THE STATE OP SCIENCE. — 1914. 

(/) Dorsal Fin. — The dorsal fin of the Sperm Whale consists of 
a prominent elevation, which rises to a height of from 14 to 18 in. 
above the line of the back. The fin is succeeded by a series of about 
six much smaller prominences which decrease in size towards the 
tail. None of these at all approaches the altitude of the dorsal fin. 
They are, nevertheless, quite obvious. On the ventral surface the 
keel of the caudal region is continued forwards towards the anus as 
a much more definite ridge than in the Baleenopterids. 

[g) Flipper. — The shape of the flipper is somewhat variable. In 
No. 21 the left pectoral appeared to have been damaged at some 
period, as there was a large notch on the preaxial side of the tip. 

(h) Spermaceti. — In every specimen the quantity of this substance 
was large, usually constituting about one-third of the total oil yield 
of a whale of this species. It occurs all over the body as well as in 
the head, but no attention is paid to it except in the head, the rest 
merely contributing to the general production of ' sperm oil.' In 
the head there are three extensive cavities, an anterior single cavity 
and two lateral cavities. They all occur in the interior of a huge 
mass of exceedingly dense, fibrous connective tissue, which, when 
drained of spermaceti, is of a snowy whiteness. This mass con- 
stitutes the great bulk of the head, and rests upon the large cup- 
like structure formed by the bones of the rostrum. The cavities 
do not appear to possess definite linings, and when the oil runs out, 
masses of light, spongy tissue filled with the liquid fat run out also, 
ns if they had been loosely attached to the walls of the cavity. They 
are probably liberated by the instruments introduced through the wall 
o&lt;f the cavity in the process o^f tapping the spermaceti. 

The following is the method of tapping. After the whale Is flensed, 
the body is cut off from the head, which is left lying on its side. 
The whole head is covered by a thick coat of mixed muscle and 
tendon running longitudinally. The tendons are conspicuous, and 
may be removed in considerable lengths with little difficulty. The 
cutting of the hole in this capsule is an arduous work, and may 
occupy nearly an hour. A mid-dorsal and an anterior aperture are 
made, and when the cavities have been penetrated, the spermaceti 
runs out as if from a pipe. A movable wooden gutter is placed beneath 
the hole, by means of which the oil is run into the two open boilers, 
in which it is cooked. 

Spermaceti is an almost colourless, transparent liquid, having a 
pale yellow tinge. It has not any noticeable odour, and the flavoui- 
is very faintly fishy, resembling that of a fresh duck egg. After 
boiling, the oil has a dark yellow colour while liquid. When cold, 
both before and after boihng, it sets stiff, but is not hard, the con- 
sistency being about that of lard. The uses of this oil have been 
indicated in the Introduction. 

From the position of the spermaceti, and also of the blow-hole in 
Physeter, the following function of the former may be suggested : The 
food of the Sperm Whale is, in the main, composed of cuttlefish 
such as Architeuthis. As these forms are bathypelagic, it follows 
that the whales must descend to considerable deptbs to feed, and 



BELMULLET WHALING STATION. 137 

remain submerged while feeding.^ A very rapid ascent would be 
exceedingly advantageous after a prolonged immersion, and the more 
rapid the ascent which could be made the longer the immersion could 
be continued. In order to be able to ascend as speedily as possible, 
it would be of the greatest advantage to possess a large mass of some 
material, having a lower specific gravity than that of water, which 
would act as a float, and such a material spermaceti is. Moreover, 
as the mass of the spermaceti is placed in the head, and as it is of 
enormous size, even compared with the great mass of a Sperm Whale, 
the animal will always ascend head first, and probably nearly verti- 
cally, with the result that the first portion of the body to come 
above the surface will be the upper edge of the snout, the precise 
situation of the spiracle. It would appear, if this suggestion be 
correct, that in order to descend and to maintain a submerged con- 
dition, muscular exertion is necessary, whereas ascent is automatic, 
and is merely accelerated by swimming movements. These two 
points are in keeping with the habits of the whale as indicated above. 
It is possible that the astounding feat which has been credited to 
Physefer, that of Hurling itself bodily out of the water, is really the 
result of a hurried ascent from a considerable depth, which has been 
so rapid that the animal has shot out of the water on reaching the 
surface. 

V. — Food of Different Species of Whale. 

The stomachs of all the species of Mystacocetes examined con- 
tained the remains of Meganyctiphanes norvegica (M. Sars), some- 
times in immense quantities. Nothing else was ever seen, except 
some fragments of flesh on one occasion, but there can be little doubt 
that these had been driven into the stomach by the explosion of the 
harpoon. No fish of any sort wei'e seen in the stomachs of any of 
these whales.^ 

The stomachs of the Sperm Whales invariably contained large 
quantities of cuttlefish beaks, which might be readily divided into 
large and small sizes, but, apart from size, there was nothing to 
differentiate the two sei'ies of beaks (fig. 1). A practically complete 
specimen of one of the molluscs was found in the stomach of No. 22 
fthe fourth Sperm Whale). The following measurements were taken 
on this animal : — 

Ft. in. 

Length of the mantle fi 

Circumference of mantle 4 

Length of the eight short arms 6 

,, ,, tentacles 21 

Length of tail 17 

Width of caudal fin 1 9t 

Diameter of largest sucker 1 " 

In addition to this specimen, we saw fragments of others of 
approximately the same size. The following specimens were pre- 
served: tip of tentacle, beak and radula in liquid, and a quantity of 
beaks and part of an internal shell in the dry state. An examination

of these remains leaves little doubt that the species is Architeuthis 
harveyi, Verrill ® — the caudal fin was too much digested to indicate 
whether it had been sagittate or not. The distal series of small, smooth 
suckers are not now on the tentacle tip, but these again may have been

lost owing to the same cause. No soft parts of any of the smaller 
cuttlefish were found. 

The molluscs appear to be quite lively when swallowed, as there 
are scars on the heads of the whales right up to the angle of the mouth. 
These have been produced by the vain efforts of the molluscs to save 
themselves. Sucker-marks were seen on the inside of one of the whales' 
stomachs. Two or three jawbones of some species of predaceous fish 
were found in the stomach of one Sperm Whale, but, except for these, 
nothing but cuttlefish remains were ever noticed. 

VI. — Notes on a Feio Miscellaneo'us Sfecimens Preserved. 

(a) One of the Norwegians gave us an object, taken from whale 
No. 5 (Finner), which was stated to have been ' inside the ribs. ' 
This appears to be a pathological structure. It is a flattened, oblong 
object about 2J in. long, and 2 in. wide, and about f in. thick. At 
one point there seems to have been a peduncle. The entire specimen 
has a very hard capsule of fibrous connective tissue, and is filled with 
a more or less reticulate mass, containing what may have been a coagul- 
able fluid. There is a certain amount of calcification in the outer layers 
just beneath the capsule, and a little fat is visible on treatment with 
Sudan III. The conclusion to which the structures observed point is 
that this is a region of connective tissue, which has become infiltrated 
with some pathological product, and has acquired the thick capsule in 
consequence of its abnormal condition. The infiltrating material is verv 
varied, in some parts it takes magenta brilliantly, while in others it 
stains in a very faint manner. The more brilliantly coloured tissue 
appears more homogeneous than that which refuses to take the stain. 
The colour of the capsule is dark brownish-grey, that of the contents 
a deep cream (fig. 2, No. 1). 

(b) There are numerous roundish glandular objects embedded in 
the fat which lies in the mid-dorsal region of the body cavity of the 
Finner and surrounds the great vessels. These are lymphatic glands. 
One such specimen preserved is of very in-egular shape. It is H in. 
in greatest length and 1^ in. in greatest breadth (fig. 2, No. 2).

BELMULLET WHALING STATION. 



139 



(c) A number of greenish bodies were taken from a similar position 
in the Sperm Whale. The specimens are about 2i in. long, about 
2 in. wide, and f in. thick, at the thickest part. The histological 
condition is exceedingly bad, as was to be expected from the general 
state of all the Sperm Whales which we saw. There is a connective- 
tissue capsule, and a great mass of the body is composed of the 
same tissue. There are two or three objects which may be sections 
of medullated nerves, and a number of rather thick-walled blood- 
vessels. No other structures can be recognised. 

(d) The rectum of Physeter has an exceedingly well-develojied 
cuticular lining for the last four or six feet of its length. In the

first specimen in which it was observed the lining was detached owing 
to decomposition, but in a later example it was found to he attached 
to the remainder of the intestinal wall. This lining is about -J in. 
thick. It has a pale yellow colour, and is of a consistency somewhat 
resembling that of a very hard-boiled egg. It is laminated, and can 
be readily split into layers. At irregular distances on the surface 
are hollows, penetrating partly or completely through the lining. The 
edges of these hollows have a puckered appearance. The line of 
junction of this lining with the mucosa of the intestine is perfectly 
sharp. The lining thins out very much just prior to its cessation, 
and the edges of successive laminae are readily observed. The actual 
thickness of the lining where it comes to an end is tV in. The colour 
of the mucous membrane, which is fairly tough, is a dull pink, very 
much stained with sepia. Longitudinal sections of this region at 
the point of junction clearly show that this is a cuticle derived from 
the stratified epithelium of the rectum. The cuticle comes to a

junction being very obvious in the slides. The epitheUal layer is 
about half as thick as the cuticular. 

VII. — Parasites. 

1. External. 

(a) Balceuophilus uniselus (Aurivillius). We have nothing to add 
to Burfield's remarks on this species.^" 

(b) PencUa (Kov. and Dan.). This parasite was observed on few 
of the whales examined, and only on the Finner. Three specimens 
were preserved, which vary in length from 5f in. to 10 in. No 
males were found as a result of the examination of these females. 
We frequently found white scars upon the skin of B. musculus, which 
were apparently healed wounds caused by Penella. The scars took the 
form of small oval marks about ^^ in. long and ^ in. wide. Beneath 
the white area the epidermis is more firmly adherent than in other 
parts of a preserved specimen, which supports the view that these 
are healed wounds. We often found open wounds on the whales, 
which had evidently been produced by this parasite. 

All the Penella which we saw occurred at the beginning of the 
season, and in the latter part of it only wounds from which the 
Copepods had fallen were observed. It may therefore be suggested 
that the period of attachment of the parasite to the whale is less 
than a year. 

(c) Coromda diadevia (L.), &amp;c. On the Humpback there were 
large quantities of this species on the tips and especially on the 
posterior margins of the flippers. They were also found on tlie 
ventral furrows, and some small specimens were adhering behind 
the penis. 

A number of specimens O'f Conclwderma aurita (L.) occurred among 
the Coronula, as well as a good number of small specimens of Cyavuis, 
which last parasite was also generally scattered over the head region. 
On Pliyseter No. 15 four specimens of Cyamus were also found on 
the throat region, where there are a few short wrnikles. On the tip 
of the lower jaw of Sperm Whale No. 16 there \\as a small colony 
of Conclwderma aurita, while another specimen of the same species 
was taken from the second tooth of the left side of the lower jaw of 
Sperm Whale No. 25. 

2. Internal. 

(a) Trematodes. — Monostomum plicatum (Creplin) was found in the 
intestines of the following Finners : 1, 3, 19, 23, 24, 27, 30. 

(b) Nematodes .—We found nematodes, which appear to be of the 
genus Ascaris, in the stomachs of every Sperm Whale examined. 
They are generally very abundant. In the renal vein of the Megaptera 
the mass of nematodes described later was found, and in the posterior 
vena cava of B. sibbaldii, No. 33, a solitary, incomplete specimen of 
another nematode was taken. These worms all appear to belong to 
the StrongylidcB. As mentioned later, in the digitate structure observed 
in the veins of B. musculus nematode eggs were found, as was also

(d) Cestodes. — One of the Norwegians drew our attention to a 
large number of soft white bodies embedded in the blubber of one 
of the Sperm Whales. They occurred in a more or less irregular 
manner at a depth of from 1| to 6 in. from the outer surface. Each 
body is enclosed in a cyst with fibrous walls from which it is readily 
detached. The accompanying figure (fig. 2, No. 3) is taken from a 
specimen in good condition and undistorted. Sections of these bodies 
clearly demonstrate that they are the cysticercus stage of some Cestode. 
The pi'oscolex occurs at one of the poles of the long axis. The 
Prince of Monaco's account of the capture of a Sperm Whale off the 
Azores in 1895 mentions numerous cysticerci in the blubber of that 
animal, which are probably identical with those here described." 

(e) Stnicture found in the renal veins and posterior vena- cava 
(see figs. 3 and 4). 

In whale No. 8 &lt;?, while searching for the suprarenal, we came 
across a series of short, digitate processes, hanging into the lumen 
of the vena cava at the point of entrance of the renal vein. A similar 
structure occurred in whales Nos. 12 3, 13 &lt;S, 27 &lt;S, 30 ?, 32 2, all 
Finners. In two of the Blue Whales, Nos. 17 ? and 33 ?, it was 
also present, as well as in Megaptera, No. 28 3, but in the last in 
a somewhat different form. In some specimens, owing to the manner 
in which the kidney was cut away from the body in removing the 
entrails, it was impossible to say whether the structure had been 
present or not. No trace of it was found in any of the Sperm Whales 
examined. 

The specimens preserved are four in number, all differing from 
one another. The accompanying figures show the two larger speci- 
mens. Fig. 3 is an example of the most digitate fonn. This 
specimen is not actually in the renal vein, but projects from the wall 
of the vena cava close to the point of entrance of the renal vein. 
The digitate processes are not actually tubular, but contain cavities. 
which in the free ends are nearly continuous, so that the whole 
process is here practically a blind sac. The diameter of the processes 
increases from the free end towards the wall of the vena cava. The 
digitations unite at the point of attachment, and the structure thus 
formed is continued beyond the wall of the vein towards the kidney. 
It is most unfortunate that we were unable to preserve a specimen 

" Vide A. E. Shipley, Archives de Pnrasitologte. IT., No. 2, p. 262, 1899,

142 REPORTS OK THE STATE OP SCIENCE, — 1914. 

sufficiently large to show whether there is an actual connection with 
the kidney itself. But from notes taken at the Station, I find that 
in one of the Blue Whales this structure was followed up, and that 
branches of the renal vein were found blocked by it in the proximal 
region of the kidney. This was also the case in the Humpback, 
No. 28. 

The interior of the digitations shows the cavities above mentioned, 
separated from each other by walls of connective tissue continuous 
with the tissue of the walls of the tube. In section the wall is seen 
to be composed of fibrous connective tissue very dense externally, 
but more open in the inner layers, where there are also some nodules 
of lymphoid tissue. The partitions between adjacent cavities come 
ofT from the inner layers of the outer wall. There are a few blood- 
vessels in these structures. The cavities are filled with material which 
varies in consistency from that of a rather stiff pulp to a stony hard- 
ness. In the latter case the material contains a varying amount of 
inorganic salts, chiefly calcium phosphate, of which there may be as 
much as 80 per cent, present. These concretions are very hard in 
the fully calcified condition, and are rounded in form in the Finners, 
but more rod-like in specimens taken from a Blue Whale and the 
Humpback. The soft material varies in its composition. In its 
softest state it is easily teased out in water, and is then seen to be 
composed of a mass of nematode eggs. Although the shells are 
very thick, and resist the action of pure nitric acid and of strong 
alkali, they are very transparent, and embryos may be seen in their 
interiors in stages of development varying from morula-like masses 
to small coiled worms. In the partially calcified material it is still 
possible to separate by teasing numbers of these ova, which are 
here covered with the calcium deposit. On the application of mineral 
acid the inorganic material dissolves away, leaving the ova distinctly 
recognisable as such. 

Fig. 4 shows a specimen which is confined to the renal vein, and 
has no digitations hanging intO' the vena cava. There is a single 
cylindrical body about 6 in. long attached to the wall of the 
renal vein by strap-like bands of varying breadth tapering somewhat 
towards their junctions with the body. Sections of this body show 
the thick wall, partitions, and congregations of ova, as described above. 
The ova appear to be embedded in a matrix nearly homogeneous, but 
containing numerous small rounded bodies, which stain daskly with 
Ehrlich's hfematoxylin. They may be nuclei, and in that case indicate 
that the matrix is probably cellular. In the renal vein of Megaptera a 
mass of tissue was found of an elongated form, and containing hard 
calcareous material together with a number of tangled nematode worms, 
which appear to belong to the family Strongylidas. The worms were 
mostly enveloped in sheathing tissue attached to the wall of the vein, but 
the sheath was not always complete. 

There can be little doubt that the presence of these worms affords 
the key to the formation of the growths described above. It is known 
that the presence in a vein of any object the surface of which is 
not smooth, or of lesions of the intima of a blood-vessel, produces

a thrombus, which may in the course of time become organised." 
The organisation takes the form of a prohieration of tlie fibrous tissue 
of the blood-vessel wall, which in the course of time entirely replaces 
the thrombus. This tissue may be supplied with blood-vessels. 
Thrombi may become calcified, and the deposition of calcium salts 
is one of the striking features of the structures under consideration. 
Again, metazoan parasites have been known to cause thrombi,^* and 
in the cases before us it is highly probable that the nematodes have 
produced vascular lesion, or the mere presence of the eggs may have 
been sufficient to excite coagulation of the blood. From either of 
these causes the thrombi may have been formed, becoming subse- 
(jueutly organised. It is interesting to note in this connection that 
pedunculated, if not digitated, thrombi have occurred in the human 
subject. The thrombus in Megaptera appears to have actually enclosed 
the worms which caused it, and they have been retained by the 
subsequent organisation. 

VIII. — Foeiuses. 

B. musculus. — None of the foetuses examined by us were suffi- 
ciently small to be of use for embryological purposes. They were all 
perfectly formed, and even in the smallest (3 ft. 11 in.) the ventral 
furrows of the adult were represented by mere lines. 

Table VI. contains a list of the foetuses, and a detailed list of 
measurements will be found in Table XII. It may be noted that 
the 8 ft. foetus of No. 30 was mutilated by some of the workers 
before we arrived on the scene, while that of No. 31 was destroyed 
before the female was opened, apparently by the harpoon explosion. 
The sizes of both of these are therefore estimates only. The fcetus 
of No. 47 (9 ft. 4 in.) was in a hopeless state of decomposition, and 
very few measurements could be taken upon it. 

(a) Body form. — In all the foetuses which we saw the form was 
the same as in the adult, but in the smallest it was noticeably more 
robust. 

(b) Colouration. — This character does not differ from that of the 
adult animals. The dark tint is found in the same situations. The 
smaller foetuses are very much less pigmented. In the 3 ft. 11 in. 
fcetus the whole skin was gorged with blood, and the black colour 
was confined to the following localities : back, tip of dorsal fin, tip 
of flippers, tips of flukes, tip of rostrum, and symphysis. 

B. sibhaldii. — One specimen, 7 ft. 7 in. in length, was seen. The 
upper surface was pale grey, the distal part of the dorsal fin and 
the external mouth parts were stained with black. 

IX. — Breeding Season of the Balanopterids . 
A factor which may be used in attempting to ascertain the probable 
breeding season of the large whales is the sizes of the foetuses observed 
at different times. Leaving for this purpose the Blue Whale out of

The j'oung whale appears to be about 20 ft. long \\hen born. 
If the size of the foetus is proportional to the length of gestation 
wliicli has elapsed since pairing until the time when the Icetus is 
measured, and if the period of gestation is ten months,''^ then the 
fcetuses found must have been the result of pairings at approximately 
the times given opposite each in the table which follows: —

These tunes can only be regarded as approximate, even if the 
premises upon which they are based be correct. It is, however, 
suggested by this table that pairing may take j^lace at any time 
between the end of December (the first in the 1913 series) and the 
beginning of July [Mth in the 1913 table), at intervals of roughly 
two months. This would indicate that the Balsenopterids are, at any 
rate, polyoestrous, and in season in December (February?), April, and 
June. All females would not be fit for breeding actually simultane- 
ously, but the precise time would vary for different individuals, and 

'' Burfield, op. cit., p. 155. 



BELMULLET WHALING STATION. 145 

this would account for some pairings occurring at such times as the 
beginning of July or the beginning of May. 

Such cases would belong to the June and April cEstra respectively. 
It is probable that such an an-angement would be advantageous. 
As the whale is a pelagic animal and individuals are widely separated, 
a fi-equently recurring breeding condition would be of great advantage to 
an animal in which pairing is to a greater or less extent casual. The 
above suggestion, which was originated by Mr. Daniel, appears to afford 
a possible explanation of the extraordinary variability in the sizes of the 
foetuses, apparently without regard to the season, a circumstance which 
the idea of a definite monoestrous condition does not elucidate. (It is 
interesting to note that oai June 13, 1913, at the Inishkea Station a 
foetus only 5 in. long was found, which must have been but a v/efek or 
two old, i.e., of the June pairing, according to the preceding method 
of reckoning the pairing times. It was, most unfortunately, not possible 
to preserve it.) 

X. — Additional Notes. 

(a) Extinction. — The whalemen state that of the whales which 
they see they are able to take only about one in ten. The animals 
are therefore perhaps not in immediate danger of being actually killed 
out. The most serious risk lies in the fact that the largest, and ■ 
therefore the adult, whales are being exterminated. True gives as the 
minimum length of adult animals 55 ft. 7 in., as no pregnant females ot 
less dimensions have been recorded. Now the whalers will take any- 
thing over 40 ft., with the result that the animals which have attained 
sexual maturity are in the gravest danger of being killed out. That the 
largest whales are being exterminated, the fall in general size at Blacksod 
between 1911 and 1913 may indicate. This means that the whales 
which are capable of reproduction are being destroyed. By the time 
that it is no longer profitable to hunt whales," it appears likely that the 
adults will have been so thinned out that they will no longer be able to 
reproduce with sufficient profusion to compensate for natural casualties. 
When this occurs the whales will be well within sight of extinction. 

(b) Capticr&amp; of Blue Whales. — Of all the species which it is profit- 
able to pursue the whalers state that the Blue Whale is the wildest, 
and they will not hunt this species if other game is to be had. A 
Blue Whale on perceiving the pulsations of the propeller of the 
approaching steamer is usually startled, and, if alarmed, at once 
rushes off at full speed. Since this represents something like twenty 
miles per hour, it is quite useless for the boat to pursue the fleeing 
animal, the speed of the steamer being only ten or twelve miles per 
hour. When the whalers are bent on catching a Blue Whale, it is 
sometimes necessary to accompany the animal for three or four days, 
until it becomes accustomed to the presence of the steamer, which can 
then approach within range, and the whale is speedily disillusioned as 
to the hannlessness of the now familiar object. 

(c) Migration Movements. — During the earlier part of the season 
the Mystacocetes are stated to travel in a north-easterly direction, 

" Burfield, op. cit., p. 153. 
1914. 



146 



REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 



during the later part iii a south-westerly. If this be so, it may be 
concluded that the latter is the return journey of those whales which 
have passed north in the beginning of the season. 

The solitary Humpback, taken on July 25, was moving in a dhec- 
tion the reverse of that which the Finners and Blue "Whales v/ere 
pm'suing at the same time. 

The only Sejhval which was captured was brought in on Septem- 
ber 6, a fact which is to be noted in connection with the whalers' 
statement to Burfield,^' that the Sejhval disappears by the end of June. 

The following is the explanation which the whalers give of 
the occurrence of Sperm Whales in these Nortliern waters. In the 
Southern seas each adult male is the leader of a herd of females, and 
as the young bulls approach maturity they are driven off by the old 
leader. These young bulls do not become leaders of herds, as they are 
inferior in strength and size to the fully adult males. But when fully 
grown they seek out herds, and contend with the leaders for the 
possession of the females. If the old males are then driven off, they 
become solitary wanderers, and frequently travel up into the North 
Atlantic. In connection with this theory it may be mentioned that 
the Sperm Whales taken at Blacksod and Inishkea are all males, and 
of great size for Sperm Whales, which iseldom exceed 60 ft., the 
average for the ten Blacksod specimens being 57 ft. Si in., while 
the smallest was 63 ft.

162 KEPORTS ON THE STATE OP SCIENCE. —1914. 



Occupation of a Table at the Zooloyical Station at Naples.— 
Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr. E. S. Goodrich 
{Chairman), Dr. J. H. Ashworth {Secretary), Sir E. Eay 
Laxkester, Professor W. C. McIntosh, Dr. S. F. Harmer, 
Professor S. J. Hickson, Mr. G. P. Bidder, Dr. W. B. 
Hardy, and Dr. A. D. Waller. 

The British Association table at Naples lias been occupied since the 
beginning of Octpber 1913 by the Hon. Mary E. Palk, and from 
March 17 to April 15, 1914, by Mrs. H. L. M. Pixell-Goodrich. An 
application for the use of the table in September and October has been 
received from Mr. J. Mangan, M.A., Government School of Medicine, 
Cairo. 

The following reports have been received: — 

The Hon. Mary E. Palk reports : ' I have occupied the Naples table 
of the British Association since October last. I have been engaged on 
a revision of Professor Anton Dohrn's monograph of the Pycnogonida 
of the Bay of Naples. The work is slow because of the difficulty of 
preparing these animals, and the modifications I have made to Dr. 
Dohrn's work are chiefly liistological. I have been unsuccessful in 
my attempts to study the habits of the living animal. I do not yet feel 
justified in publishing the results of my researches, as most of my 
conjectures require further proof, which it is not always easy to obtain.' 
Mrs. H. L. M. Pixell-Goodrich reports : From March 17 to April 15, 
1914, I occupied the British Association table at the Stazione Zoologica, 
Naples. During tThis time I searched for parasitic Protozoa in various 
marine invertebrates, and investigated chiefly stages in the development 
and sporogony of Lithocystis and Urospora of Echinocardiwm cordatum 
and Gonospora of Glycera siphonostoma. The results of these researches 
I hope shortly to publish. ' 

The Committee being wishful to encourage zoologists and physi- 
ologists to apply for the use of the table, and believing they are often 
deterred from applying by an exaggerated idea of the expense involved, 
prepared a statement giving an estimate of the cost of going to and 
living in Naples. A copy of this statement was sent to every zoological 
laboratory and most of the physiological laboratories in the United 
Kingdom. It is hoped that increased use will be made of the excellent 
facilities which the table offers for the prosecution of researches in 
Zoology and in the Physiology (including the chemistry) of marine 
organisms. 

In the report for last year attention was drawn to the sum of 501. 
remaining in the hands of the Committee. Professor Hickson, on 
retiring from the Chairmanship of the Committee, transferred this sum 
to the present Chairman. The Committee have therefore requhed only 
50L from the Association this year to complete the sum due for the 
upkeep of the table. 

The Committee ask to be reappointed with a grant of 1001. 



MARINE LABORATORY, PLYMOUTH. 163 



Marine Laboratory , Plymouth. — Report of the Committee, con- 
sisting of Professor A. Dendy (Chairinan and Secretary), Sir 
E. Eay Lankester, Professor Sydney H. Vines, Mr. E. S. 
Goodrich, and Professor J. P. Hill, appointed to nominate 
competent Naturalists to perform definite pieces of work at 
the Marine Laboratory , Plymouth. 

Since the date of the last report the use of the table has been granted 
to Mr. J. S. Dunkerly for one month for the purpose of investigating 
Protozoa, especially those parasitic in fish- 



Experiments in Inheritance. — Final Report of the Committee, 
consisting of Professor W. A. Herdman (Chairman) , Mr. K. 
Douglas Laurie {Secretary), Professor E. G. Punnett, and 
Dr. H. W. Marett Tims, appointed to enable Mr. Laurie 
to conduct such Experiments. (Drairn up by the Secretary.) 

The experiments were commenced in December 1907 with the object 
set forth in the first interim report presented to the Dublin Meeting of 
the Association in 1908. They were brought to an end in 1911, and 
some of the results summarised in the report to the Portsmouth 
Meeting that year. A more detailed account is now given in this 
final report. 

The data concern in the main two matters : (A) the inlieiitance of 
yellow coat colour in mice, and (B) the inheritance of dense and 
dilute colourations in mice. 

The following dense colours have come under my notice during 
the experiments: yellow, golden-agouti, cinnamon-agouti, black, and 
chocolate. On the presence and absence hypothesis, 

homozygous golden-agouti may be represented by zygotic formula yy GG BB Ch Ch. 

„ cinnamon-agouti „ ,, ,, yy GG bb Ch Ch. 

black „ „ „ yy gg BB Ch Ch. 

„ chocolate „ „ „ yy gg bb Ch Ch. 

where Y = factor for yellow colour (not barred). 

G = ,, ,, barred arrangement of yellow colour found in hairs of 

agouti (grey) mice. 
B = ,, ,, black colour. 
Ch = ,, „ chocolate colour. 

Yellow appears to be always heterozygous, and zygotic formulfe representing 
various kinds of yellow mice may be arrived at by replacing yy of the above series 
byYy. 

Each of the above colours may occur in a dense form, in which the 
pigment is densely deposited, or in a dilute form; these dense and

166 REPORTS ON THE STATE OP SCIENCE. — 1914. 

dilute conditions are allelomorphic, and may be represented by 
presence or absence of the factor D. 

Further, any of the above conditions may be present potentially, 
but remain undeveloped in absence of some colour-activating material 
which may be represented by factor C ; in the absence of this factor 
the animal is an albino. 



A. The InherUance of Yellow Coat Colour in Mice. 

In the first place, all my yellow mice appear to be heterozygous in 
respect of their yellow coat colour; none which have been fairly tested 
breeding true to yellowness, but on the other hand giving offspring 
which include, in addition to yellows, a proportion of individuals 
whose colour is other than yellow. Yellow is incompletely epistatic 
to black and chocolate. 1 find that, as Durham points out, black 
pigment may be present in the hairs of yellows throwing blacks, and 
chocolate pigment in the hairs of yellows throwing chocolates. 
Moreover, the degi-ee of development of these other pigments in the 
hairs varies a good deal during the life of the animal. 

The tendency to abnormal fattening of yellow mice pointed out by 
Durham was also evident in the mice used by me. 

I ai'range the matings which concern yellow mice in two tables : 
yellow X yellow, and yellow x other colour. The aibbreviations in 
brackets indicate the immediate parentage of the mice concerned. 
Whei-e the heterozygous nature of a yellow mouse is not shown in 
the table by its offspring a note is added of some additional mating 
showing it to be heterozygous (see tables on pp. 164, 165, and 168, 
169). 

I. In regard to the matings yellow x yellow given in the table 
on pp. 164 and 165 certain points may be noted: 

(a) Twenty-six of the mice used were derived from the cross 
yellow X yellow, and expectation was that at least one-third of 
these would prove to be trae-breeding yellows. There are only two, 
liowever (marked with asterisk), which could possibly answer to this 
condition, and there is no evidence about them beyond that given in the 
table. It will be seen that they iproduced only two and three young 
respectively. Matings with other mice designed to test them 
gametically proved sterile. It would evidently be inappropriate to 
quote these as examples of mice homozygous in yellow. 

(b) The total number of offspring is 72 yellow and 41 other 
colour. On the theory that yellov.'-bearing gametes do not conjugate, 
one would expect the ratio 3:1, from which the calculated result of 
the above matings would be 8475: 28-25, a very poor approximation 
indeed. On the alternative theory that the yellow-bearing gametes do 
actually conjugate but that the zygotes so produced perisli before 
birth, one would expect the ratio 2:1, from which the calculated 
result would be 75'3:37'6, a very close approximation to the experi- 
mental figures. The latter suggestion, moreover, harmonises with the 



EXPERIMENTS IN INHERITANCE. 167 

combined results of Cu6not, Castle, and Durham. Adding my own 
results to those of the other observers named, we find: — 

Yellow. Other colour. 

Cuenot 263 100 

Castle (1910) 800 435 

Durham (1911) 448 232 

Laurie 72 41 

Erperimental 1583 808 

Calculated 2:1 1594 797 

It is of interest to find this anomalous result confirmed from 
experiments with an additional independent strain of mice. 

(c) The number of young in a litter from yellow x yellow which 
survive to an age at which their colour is determinable is small, 
averaging only 3'64, as against 4"58 among mice of other colours. Tt 
is possible that this is associated with the hypothetical abortion of 
zygotes homozygous in yellow. Cuenot and Castle find a similar 
though smaller difference in size of family; but, on the other hand, 
Durham does not. (See Appendix A.). 

II. Tlie table on pp. 168 and 169 shows a list of matings of yellow 
X other colour. One notes : 

(a) The 54 matings of yellow x other colour give 131 yellow : 
125 other coloured young, expectation being, on the supposition that 
all the yellows were heterozygous, 128 : 128. 

(b) There were 36 yellow mice involved in the matings, of which 
11 were known from their parentage to be heterozygous. The 
remaining 25 were derived from yellow x yellow, and one-third at least 
of these should have been gametically pure to yellow and have given 
only yellow j'oung when mated to mice of any other colour. But all 
save one, and this had a couple of youngsters only, tlii'ew some other 
colour in addition to yellow. 

(c) Of the 25 yellow mice ex yellow x yellow 14 are recorded also 
in the list of matings of yellow X yellow, so that 11 remain to be added 
to the 26 of the other list, making 37 yellow mice of which both 
parents were yellow, and of which none, on being tested adequately, 
proved to be homozygous, thougli about a dozen should liave been so, 
even assuming both the yellow jiarents to liave been in each case 
heterozygous 

(J) The number of 3'oung in a litter from yellow x &lt;-)tlier colour 
which survived to an age at which tlieir colour was determinable 
averages 4"74, much the same as in the case of matings in which botli 
pai'enls are some colour otlier than yellow, where the avei'age is 4"58. 
Tliere is no' reason associated with the theory of abortion of zygotes 
Y Y wliy this should be otherwise. There is, of course, no oi)portunity 
for the formation of such zygotes in the mating of yellow x other 
colour.

REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 



Some of the yellow mice were mated with albinos, as I wished to 
discover and eliminate strains carrying albinism. These matings were 
thus incidental, but may nevertheless be put on record as follows: —

to discuss the above 



matings 



It does not appear necessary 
individually, but one notes : — 

(a) In thoise litters where albinos are present the proportions of 
coloured and albino young agree with expectation. Equality is ex- 
pected, the numbers are 14:14. 

(b) Among the coloured offsp)'ing 45 are yellow and &lt;jG other colour, 
expectation being equality since all the yellow parents are known to be 
heterozygous either fi-om their parentage or from some other mating. 

Cioucral JlrxiilL^; of Ike Preaeul Experiments on the lieredily of Yellow 

Coat Colour in Mice. 

Firstly, to confirm in a different strain of mice the evidence that 
yellow mice occur only in the heterozygous condition ; and secondly, 
to support the view that in the mating yellow X yellow, zygotes of the 
formula Y Y are actually formed, but are abortive. 



EXPERIMENTS IN INHERITANCE. 171 

B. Dense and Dilute Colourations. 

Each coloui- in the epistatic series has its dense and dilute form, 
density and dilution forming an allelomorphic pair. Density may be 
thought of as due to the presence of a factor D and dilution as due to 
the absence of this factor. My investigations concern the dense and 
dilute forms of black and chocolate. 

I was led to investigate this matter through the appearance, 
recorded in my 1908 report, of black, blue, and chocolate young in a 
litter from the mating of two blacks, and the fact that a particular 
yellow mouse threw blacks when mated with chocolate, and blues 
when mated with blue. While working the matter out. Miss Durham's 
account (1908) of similar experiments appeared. The details I now 
publish confirm her work, while showing that Cuenot's suggestion that 
chocolate is the dilute fomi of black is untenable. I am able to add 
some further types of crosses to those recorded by Durham, which give 
the expected results. 

Evidence against Cuinot's suggestion that chocolate is the dilute 
form of hlach and in favour of the view : — 

a. That chocolate carries the factor for dense deposition of pigment, 
and that silver-fawn is the condition of chocolate in which this factor 
is absent; 

b. Thai hlach carries the factor for dense deposition of pigment, 
and that blue is the condition of black in which this factor is absent. 

Black and chocolate are the two lowest terms in the epistatic 
colour sei'ies.

In the above records, both Miss Durham's and my own, only 
those mice are counted which lived long enough for their colours to 
be determined. 

The strikingly smaller size in my experiments of the average litter 
ex yellow x yellow, as compared with the other matings, is commented 
on above. A lesser difference was observed by Cu^not also (yellow x 
yellow 3'38; yellow x other colour 3-74) and Castle (yellow x yellow 
4-71; yellow x other colour 5'57). On the other hand, Durham's 
figures warn one to be cautious as to one's inferences.

APPENDIX B. 

Alhiiiii Mice. 

I crossed many of my mice with albinos in the process of testing 
their genetic behaviour. There appears to be no need to set out the 
results in detail, but the following points may be noted: — 

The size of litter in the three types of mating — albino x albino, 
albino X yellow, and albino x colour other than yellow — is given in 
Appendix A. 

The colour composition of the litters from albino x colour con- 
formed to the rules now well established for the heredity of albinism 
in mice. 

Fourteen of the matings albino x colour yielded some albino young ; 
the total young from these matings numbered 37 albino: 30 coloured, 
expectation being equality. 

APPENDIX C. 
Piebald Mice. 

A piebald chocolate-and-white mouse appeared in a litter born to a 
chocolate mouse bought in kindle from a dealer. I bred from it to the 
Eg generation in order to assure myself that it acted as a recessive to 
self-colour.

The Question of Fatigue frovi the Economic Standpoint. — 
Interim Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor 
J. H. MuiRHBAD {Chairman), Miss B. L. Hutchins (Secre- 
tanj). Miss A. M. Anderson, Professor Bainbridgb, 
Mr. E. Cadbury, Mr. P. Sargant Florence, Professor 
Stanley Kent, Mr. W. T. Layton, Dr. T. G. Maitland, 
Miss M. C. Matheson, Dr. C. S. Myers, Mr. J. W. Eams- 
bottom, and Dr. J. Jenkins Kobe. In addition, help has 
hccii kindly afforded hy the following : Miss Mabel Atkin- 
son, Dr. Wm. Brown, Mr. Arthur Greenwood, and Dr. 
Udney Yule. 

The Committee has met four times, and has made a preUminary 
survey of the subject of investigation, and has discussed tlie matter 
at some length. 

An extensive Bibhography of Fatigue has been prepared for the 
use of the Committee by Miss B. L. Hutchins. 

A short report has been drawn up on industrial experiments in 
shortening hours, also by Miss Hutchins. 

Some notes have been kindly contributed by Dr. William Brown 
on the existing state of psychological knowledge in regard to fatigue. 

A Memorandum on the provisional aims and methods of the inquiry 
has been drawn up by Mr. Eamsbottom, and adopted by the Com- 
mittee as a basis of its future work. 

As a result of our prehminary survey, we have become aware that 
a considerable amount of work on the subject has been done in America 
and on the Continent of Europe, and, so far, comparatively little in 
this country. 

We consider, however, that but little definite information exists, 
and detailed scientific investigation is badly needed, especially in 
view of the rapid development of the factory industry and the pro- 
gressive urbanisation of the working class in this country. 

We propose, if reappointed, to adopt the following method of 
investigation : — 

Mr. Eamsbottom has defined the object of inquiry as being ' to 



176 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 

ascertain the effect on physique, accident occurrence, production and 
general social well-being of present conditions relating to fatigue 
occuiTence in industrial work, and to discuss possible improvements 
therein, and the best methods of obtaining them.' We concur with 
this definition. 

We hope that Dr. Maitland, being a member of our Committee, 
will prepare a short resume of existing knowledge on the effects of 
muscular and mental fatigue respectively. We shall also endeavoiu" 
to ascertain what are the main subjective and objective determinants 
of fatigue; e.g., what is the relative importance of muscular woi'k, 
mental strain, monotony, atmospheric wet-bulb temperature (kata- 
thermometric condition), noise, light, etc. ; and to discover some 
reliable physiological quantitative index of fatigue, and the chief 
physiological effects of over-fatigue. 

We shall consider the questions what increase, if any, has occurred 
in general morbidity in recent years, and to what extent this can be 
ascribed to industrial fatigue ; and what difference can be traced between 
the morbidity cases of workers in various age groups from fifteen 
upwards engaged in occupations involving long hours of work or 
specially fatiguing conditions, and those for all workers or workers in 
fairly easy occupations. 

We shall also consider the incidence of industrial accidents in 
relation to hours of work ; and the variation in the output of work 
per hour during the day, and the output per day with various lengths 
of working-day. 

We propose to give special attention to the speeding-up of 
machinery, and to inquire how far this has been accompanied by a 
reduction of hours. 

We shall also consider the probable social reactions of over- 
fatigue, and what general remedies, if any, may seem most j^romising 
and hopeful. 

The Committee has made a preliminary division of the v\'ork, as 
so sketched, among the following sub-committees: — 

Physiological and Psychological. Industrial. Statistical. 

Dr. Maitland {Convener). Miss Anderson. Mr. Layton (Convener). 

Prof. Muirhead. Mr. Cadbury. Miss Hutcliins. 

Dr. Myers. Mr. Florence (Con.re»er). Mr. Ramsbottom. 

Dr. Bainbridge. Miss Hutchins. Dr. Yule. 

Dr. Legge. Miss Matheson.

Gaseous Explosions. — Seccnth Report of the Committee, con- 
sisting of Dr. DuGALD Clerk (Chairman) , Professor Dalby 
(Secretary), and Professors W. A. Bone, P. W. Burstall, 
H. L. Callendar, E. Gr. Cokbr, H. B. Dixon, Drs. E. T. 
G-LAZEBROOK and J. A. Harker, Colonel H. C. L. Holden, 
Professors B. Hopkinson and J. E. Petavel, Captain H. 
EiALL Sankey, Professors A. Smithells and W. Watson, 
Mr. D. L. Chapman and Mr. H. E. Wimperis. 

The decease of the CHairmau, Sir William Preece, was reported to the 
Committee in December last, when a letter of condolence was sent to 
the family. 

Sir WiUiani Preece had associated himself intimately with the 
investigations carried out by the Committee, and contributed an interest- 
ing Note on the Kinetic Theory of Gases. As Chairman he did much 
to help forward the important work on which the Committee is 
engaged both by his valuable suggestions and by his tactfulness and 
resource. His loss is not only deeply deplored, but felt to be a 
personal one by every member of the Committee. 

The Vice-Chairman, Dr. Dugald Cleek, was unanimously elected 
Chairman. 

The Committee met three times during the session 1913-14 at the 
City and Guilds (Engineering) College, Exhibition Eoad, London, S.W. 
The following Notes were presented and discussed : — 

Note 32 by Professor Dalby on Suction Temperatures directly 
measured and deductions therefrom, together with a summary of a 
series of seventeen experiments made at the City and Guilds (Engineer- 
ing) College on a Crossley gas-engine with a cylinder seven inches in 
diameter, stroke fourteen inches, and with a compi-ession ratio at 4'8. 

Note 33 by Mr. H. E. Wimperis on Thermal Efficiency. 

Note 34 by Professor E. G. Coker and Mr. W. A. Scoble on 
Temperature Distribution in the Cylinder of a GaiS-engine. 

Note 35 by Professor W. Watson on the Spectroscopic Study of 
the Combustion of Air-petrol Mixtures. 

The object of Note 32 was to show how the suction temperature 
varied with the speed, with the jacket temperature, and with the 
mixture. The records given in the Note relate to trials Nos. 72 to 90. 
The data were obtained by a research student of the City and Guilds 
(Engineering) College, Mr. Limbourne, working under the supervision 
of Professor Dalby. A table included in the Note shows the variation 
in the suction temperatures, and a set of curves, also included, gives 
the temperatures of the working mixture ; these indicate how the direct 
knowledge of the suction temperature can be applied tO' determine the 
temperatures at other parts of the cycle. 

In Note 33 Mr. Wimperis discusses the thermal efficiency of an 
engine using as the working agent a standard gas referred to in the first

report of the Committee, and using in his calculations the values of 
the internal energy defined by the curve in fig. 6 of that report. 

In Note 34 Professor Coker describes the method of measuring 
the cyclical temperature in a gas-engine cylinder used by him at the 
Technical College, Finsbury, and gives the results of some recent 
experiments. Curves are included showing the temperature of the 
explosive charge, together with tables of the actual temperatures at 
various points in the cycle. A full description of the thermo-couple 
used in these experiments is given in the Note. 

In connexion with Note 35 Professor Watson showed a series of 
photographs of the spectrum of the hght given by the burning charge 
in the cylinder of a petrol engine. The results show that the gases 
in the cylinder continue to emit light giving a line spectrum for a 
considerable time after the chemical changes are generally assumed to 
have been completed. 

Before proceeding to consider the work carried out during the 
current session it has been thought advisable to give a brief summary 
of the previous reports of the -Committee. 

Summary of Previous Reports. 

The first report is devoted mainly to the subject of the specific 
heats of gases at high temperatures. The constant-pressure experi- 
ments of Wiedemann, Eegnault, Holborn, and Henning are analysed 
and discussed, and a cm-ve is given showing the energy of CO,, steam, 
and air in terms of the temperature Centigrade. The experiments of 
Dr. Dugald Clerk are described, and the results obtained compared 
with the constant-pressure experiments mentioned above. The closed 
vessel experiments of Mallard, Le Chatelier, and Langen are analysed 
and the results plotted and discussed. 

The report ends with the discussion of thermal equilibrium, chemical 
equilibrium, the motion of a gas, and the measm'ement of temperature. 
A curve is given showing the internal energy of a gas-engine mixture 
in terms of the temperature. 

There is an appendix by Professor Callendar on ' The Deviation of 
Actual Gases from the Ideal State,' and on ' Experimental Errors in 
the Determination of their Specific Heats.' 

The second report is mainly devoted to the subject of the specific 
heat of gases at high temperatures. Eegnault 's results at low tem- 
peratm-es are discussed in the light of Mr. Swann's experiments, 
which were communicated to the Committee by Professor Callendar. 
The Committee definitely adopted Mr. Swann's values for air and for 
CO2 as given below. 

Volumetric heat of air at 100° C. is 19-8 lbs. per cubic foot, 

„ „ C0.&gt; at 20° C. is 27-4 lbs. per cubic foot, and 

at 100° C. is 30'7 lbs. per cubic foot. 

The results of the experiments made by Dr. Dugald Clerk with the 
object of determining the volumetric heat of air at high temperature 
are given in the report, togefher with a description of Professor 



ON GASEOUS EXPLOSIONS. 179 

Hopkinson's experiments on the compression of air in a gas-engine 
cylinder. 

Dr. Watson's researches on the efficiency of a petrol motor are 
included in the report. Dr. Watson made a simultaneous measure- 
ment of the quantities of air and petrol taken into the engine and of 
the chemical composition of the exhaust gas. The point brought out 
was that the ratio of hydrogen to carbon in the exhaust gas was greater 
than the ratio of hydrogen to carbon in the petrol used. Additional 
evidence of this discrepancy is furnished by some experiments of 
Professor Hopkinson, and the experiments of Hopkinson and Watson 
are in agreement. 

The report concludes with an account of the experiments on radia- 
tion carried out by Professor Hopkinson. 

There are two appendices : one relating to Regnault's coiTections in 
connection with the determination of the specific heat of air, and the 
other relating to Deville's experiments on the dissociation of gases by 
Dr. Harker. 

The third report is devoted mainly to the consideration of the 
subject of radiation from gases. A brief general history of the subject 
is given, together with a record of the experiments of Professor 
Hopkinson and of Professor Callendar. The report discusses the direct 
effect of radiation on the efficiency of internal-combustion motors, the 
amount of radiation from flames, and the molecular theory of radiation 
from gases as well as the question of the transparency of flames to 
their own radiation. There is an appendix on the radiation of flames 
by Professor Callendar, giving some account of experiments made with 
a Meker burner; a second appendix on the radiation in a gaseous 
explosion by Professor Hopkinson; and a third appendix which 
contains abstracts from various papers relating to the application of 
heat radiation from luminous liames to Siemens' Eegenerating 
Furnaces, 

The fourth report merely notes the number of meetings held during 
the year, and states that, partly owing to the breakdown of apparatus 
and partly to the demands made upon the time of the various investi- 
gators, only two notes were read; consequently it was decided that 
the work then on hand should be included in the report for the 
following year. 

The fifth report continues the discussion of the effect of radiation, 
and is devoted mainly to the consideration of the factors which deter- 
mine the heat flow from the gas to the walls of the cylinder. The 
remarkable effect of turbulence on the rate of combustion is first 
mentioned in this report. Particulars of Dr. Dugald Clerk's experi- 
ments are given, and these experiments definitely establish the fact 
that but for turbulence the speed at which modern internal-combustion 
engines are run would be impossible. Professor Hopkinson's experi- 
ments, in which a fan was placed inside a closed vessel and the rates 
of combustion observed v,ith the fan at rest and in motion, are recorded 
in the report, and confirm Dr. Clerk's results. 

In the sixth report the resignation of Dr. Dugald Clerk and 
Professor Hopkinson from the Joint Secretaryship of the Committee is

reported. Dr. Clerk consented, however, to act as Vice-Chairman, 
and Professor Dalby was appointed Secretary. 

The Committee allocated the whole of the grant to the Secretary 
for the purpose of providing him with a permanent research assistant 
to carry on the work. It was stated that Professor Dalby and Dr. 
Clerk were engaged on the design of an experimental plant to be 
placed in the new laboratory of the City and Guilds (Engineering) 
College. 

Six notes, relating chiefly to heat flow, temperature, and leakage, 
are briefly summarised. 

Object of Present Report. 

The following report is devoted partly to the special consideration 
of temperature measurements and subjects arising therefrom, and partly 
to the illustration of the use which can be made of the data obtained by 
the Committee. 

Methods of Measuring Temperature of the Charge in a Gas-engine 
Cylinder binder working conditions. 

One of the problems requiring solution was the direct measurement 
of the temperature of the working agent in the cylinder while the 
engine was running under ordinary working conditions. The difficulty 
of making this measurement arises from the fact that during the 




Fig. 1. 



explosion of the charge in the engine cylinder the temperature is 
sometimes higher than that of the melting-point of platinum or of the 
couples which can be put in the cylinder to make the measurement. 

In Note 32 is described a method devised by Professors Callendar 
and Dalby, 1 which for the first time enabled direct observation of the

181 



suction temperature to be made while the engine was working not 
only under normal conditions but under special conditions, during 
which the richest possible mixture was used and the temperature 
reached at explosion was considerably liigher than that occurring in 
practice. The thermometer itself consisted of a piece of platinum 
wire about 0"7 inch long and yo^o of an inch in diameter, arranged 
with compensating leads. It is placed in a thermometer-valve, which 
is inserted through the spindle of the admission-valve in the manner 
shown in fig. 1, in which P is the platinum thermometer, and T is 
the head of the thermometer-valve, which is inserted centrally in the

G^S ENGINE.

Fig. 2. 

admission-valve A. The spring S serves to close the admission- 
valve, and the spring U serves to close the thermometer-valve. The 
main casting, C, carrying these valves is bolted to the engine in the 
ordinary way. A separate cam is mounted on the half-time shaft to 
operate the central thermometer-valve, and the complete arrangement 
is shown in fig. 2, where E is the cam; I and L are levers keyed to the 
supplementary shaft Q, which is carried on the casting F; the spring 
S maintains contact between the end of the lever I and the cam. The 
end of the thermometer with the leads projecting is shown at B. 
The lever L is in contact with the nut N on the thermometer -valve. 
The cam is so designed that during the explosion period the valve 



182 



REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 



is closed, and the thermometer therefore screened from the action 
of the gas. In this way the thermometer is withdrawn just before 
the end of compression, so that at this critical period of the cycle 
there is nothing in the shape of a protuberance to cause preignition. 
When the platinum thermometer is exposed in the cylinder and 
connected to the Wheatstone bridge and galvanometer on which the 
indications are received, the circuit is made by a contact-maker on the 
crank-shaft when the crank passes through an assigned crank-angle, and 
is broken by the contact-maker when the crank passes through a second 
assigned crank-angle a little greater than the first, so that the electrical 



IftSULfiriON"

measuring device is in operation during 6°, 10°, or 15° as the case 
may be. 

This contact-maker is a very important part of the electrical equip- 
ment used in connexion with these temperature measurenients, as it 
enables a definite make and a definite break to be made in the electrical 
circuit, and, in addition, enables the time between the make and break 
to be adjusted with accuracy. 

The contact-maker (fig. 3) consists of a brass bush B, keyed to a 
lay shaft of the engine, and carrying two^ fibre washers or cams Wj and 
W:, which can be clamped in any relative angular position against the 
flange of the bush by the nut N. A radial step, as -Wi, is made in 
each washer, and the surface gradually rises from the bottom of the 
step to the normal circular surface of the washer. The reflexed ends

of the stiff springs S[ and Ss rest on the fibre cams. A projection Z 
carrying a platinum-pointed screw p is riveted to one of the springs, 
and the screw p is adjusted so that its point is just clear of the platinum 
rivet in the other spring when both springs are riding on the circular 
surfaces of their respective cams. Contact is made when the rotation 
of the lay shaft in the direction of the arrow brings the radial step 
Wi of the cam Wi under the spring Si, thereby allowing it to fall down 
the step, thus bringing p and r together. Contact is broken when the 
radial step iv. of the cam W. reaches the spring S,, thereby allowing 
the second spring to fall down the step w^. The epoch and duration 
of contact are readily adjusted by adjusting the angular positions of 
the cams relatively to the bush and also with regard to one another. 
The distances between the springs and the platinum contacts and the 
steps w are exaggerated in the diagram in order to make the principle 
of the apparatus clear. The percussion form of contact with platinum 
points is found to give definite and certain results. The contacts keep

clean, and no trouble of any kind is experienced with them. The general 
arrangement of the electrical connections are shown m fig. 4. In this 
figure PS, QS are the equal ratio arms of the Wheatstone bridge. 
The galvanometer G is connected to the point S and to the sliding 
contact on the bridge-wire BW. The thermometer and its leads P 
are connected on one side of the bridge-wire, and the compensator C 
and the balancing resistance E on the other. The battery circuit 
includes a mercury reversing key K, an adjustable resistance r, and 
a storage cell V; and the battery is connected to the bridge at the 
points P and Q, and to the brushes of the periodic contact-maker at E. 
The brushes E are carried by an insulated arm A bolted to a divided 
disc O riding loosely on the lay shaft of the engine, and capable of 
being clamped in any position by the screw L. The index I shows 
the crank-angle corresponding to the middle point of the contact when 
the insulated copper strip D carried in the fihre bush F passes under 
the brushes. 



184 REPORTS ON THE STATE OP SCIENCE. — 1914| 

The temperature is measured, therefore, during a particular crank- 
angle determined hy the setting of the contact-maker. This can 
be set, while the engine is running, to determine the make and 
break at any assigned crank-angle in the revolution. Tt was usually 
set so that the interval between the make and break was 5° or 10°. 
In this manner the mean temperature over a small crank-angle can 
be measured at any point in the cycle, except only during the period 
of the explosions when the thermometer is withdrawn from the cylinder. 
But although there is this possibility with the method it is desirable 
to measure the temperature at a point on the cycle where the rate 
of change of temperature is at a minimum. This point occurs just 
after the closing of the suction-valve. The great advantage of making 
the measurement at this point is that the thermometer is exposed to 
the incoming charge during the whole of the suction-stroke and 
therefore the thermometer-valve tends to assume the temperature of 
the charge; consequently the temperature which the small wire is set 
to measure does not differ greatly from the temperature of the metal 
in which it is mounted. This condition tends to minimise the errors 
of measurement. At any other point in the cycle the rate of change 
of temperature is greater; and the error of the measurements, there- 
fore, is likely to be gi'eater owing to the lag of the thermometer. 
On the expansion-stroke, for example, the temperature may vary as 
much as 150° during the movement of the piston through jL of the 
stroke. Just after the closing of the suction-valve the variation of 
temperature during the movement of the piston through yV; of the 
stroke is only about 20°. 

Having found the temperature at one point in the cycle, the tem- 
perature at any other point can be calculated by using the charge itself 
as the thermometric agent. The characteristic equation of the charge is 

PV 

-jp-=a constant. If, therefore, from the indicator diagram taken at 

the time the temperature was measui'ed, the corresponding pressure 
and volume are measured, then the temperature at any other point of 
the cycle can be calculated by the aid of this constant and the pressure 
and volume scaled from tlie indicator diagram, allowance being made 
for chemical contraction of the charge after explosion. It is necessary 
to have accurate indicator diagrams from which to measure the 
pressure and volume for this purpose, and this has led to the develop- 
ment of an optical indicator. 

Example of the Application of the Method to an Engine Trial 
(72) at the City and Guilds (Engineering) College. 

The general procedure in making temperature measurements by 
this method, and with an improved optical indicator devised by Pro- 
fessor Dalby and Dr. Watson, may be illustrated by data obtained 
during a trial made at the City and Guilds (Engineering) College by 
Professor Dalby last year, a full report of which will be found in 
Note 32 communicated to the Committee.

Indicator Diagrams. 

In each trial two indicator diagi'ams were taken — namely, a com- 
plete diagram showing the pressure and volume during the whole 
cycle, and a diagram taken with a thin disc stopped down so as to 
give on a large scale the portion of the diagram during the pumping- 
stroke. The diagrams are in general calibrated in situ.

In carrying out a series of experiments, however, it was found that 
the scale was so constant that it was unnecessary to calibrate each 
diagram separately. The scale was therefore made for the two discs 
used, and was checked from time to time. A pair of typical diagrams

Fig. 9 shows temperature-curves for the compression stroke calcu- 
lated in this way, both for trials 72 and 73. Trial 73 was run at about 
200 r.p.m. 

The constant, however, cannot be applied during the whole cycle, 
because, although the weight of the charge remains the same, assum- 
ing that there is no leak, yet the volume corresponding to this weight 
is slightly different after the explosion has taken place owing to the 
contraction due to the chemical rearrangement of the constituents. 
The chemical contraction is calculated from the analyses of the gases. 
In the gas used in the experiments referred to the contraction 
amounted to 3 '14 per cent. The effect of this is to change the gas 
constant for all points along the expansion-cm've ivom 001616 to 
0-01565. 

The curve, fig. 10, shows the temperatures calculated along the 
expansion-curves for trials 72 and 73. 

When applying this method of taking the temperatures the governor 
should be put out of action, so that there shall be no change in the 
rate of the supply of gas which will produce a distui'bance of the 
temperature in the cycle. Any disturbance pi'oduced in a particular 
cycle causes a temperature wave through a long series of succeeding 
cycles. In practice the gas-engine can be run without any difficulty 
without the governor if the engine is coupled to a generator, because 
the generator automatically settles down to the speed corresponding 
to the power applied to it, and by regulating the resistance of the 
ai-mature or the fields, or both, the desired speed can be maintained 
for long periods. A special switch-board and a resistance-board have 
been designed for the engine at the City and Guilds (Engineering) 
College for the purpose of controlling the generator. 

Method of Measuring the Temperature of the Charge by means of a 

Thermo-couple. 

The second method of measuring the temperature of the charge 
in the cylinder is by means of a couple. This method has been 
developed by Dr. Coker and Mr. Scoble at the Technical College, Fins- 
bury. It was found that alloys of platinum with rhodium and iridium 
respectively were able to withstand the temperature of explosion 
near the walls of the cylinder for some hours or even days when 
made into thermo-couples jo^^u to t^§o0 ^^ ^^ i^ich thick, provided 
the engine was not overloaded. The actual temperature measurement 
is made by observing the change in the electromotive force produced 
in this couple by a change in temperature. The small changes in 
the electromotive force produced by a couple of this kind can be 
measured with great accuracy on the bridge described below. 

The general relation between electromotive force and temperature 
found for one of the couples used is 

E (microvolts) = -174 + 7.6075T-0.001673T^ 

The general arrangement of the apparatus is shown in fig. 11.

electromotive force of a cadmium cell, C, which can be opposed to the 
battery electromotive force by means of the upper key, K^, an allowance 
for the known temperature variation of the electromotive force of the 
standard cell used being made by an adjustable contact-maker, D. 
The thermo-electric couple, H, has one lead connected to the lower 
key, K2, and the other set to a set of resistances, S, in the main circuit, 
each of which gives a difference of potential of 1 millivolt when the

adjustments are correct. During an observation, therefore, the battery 
electromotive force opposes that of the couple and the readings of 
the bridge-wire and step resistance taken together measure the electro- 
motive force of the couple when the galvanometer, G, shows a 
balance. The scale of the bridge-wire is graduated to read to 10 micro- 
volts, and single microvolts may be read by estimation. The majority 
of the observations were taken when using a D'Arsonval galvanometer, 
giving, on a scale distant 110 centimetres, a deflection of 560 milli-

metres for 1 microvolt. The contact-maker used with this apparatus 
is one devised by Professors Callendar and Dalby, which has already 
been described and illustrated in fig. 3. 

Suction Temperature. 

Direct measurements of the suction temperature were made at the 
City and Guilds (Engineering) College during the session 19] 2-13 on 
a Crossley gas-engine with a cylinder 7 inches in diameter, stroke 
14 inches, and with a compression ratio of 4"8. The object of the 
experiment was to show how the suction temperature varied with the 
speed, with the jacket temperature, and with the mixture. 

The apparatus with which the measurement was made has been 
already described (see pages 180, 181, 182, and 183). The results of the 
experiments are shown by the curves fig. 12. It is proposed to repeat 
these experiments on engines of more modern type and with higher 
compression ratios as soon as the development of the new laboratories 
at the College render it possible to do so. 

The Cyclical Variation of the Temperature of the Charge in a 
Gas-engine Cylinder. 

An example has already been given of the method of determining 
the cyclical variation of the temperature of the charge in a par- 
ticular experiment, deducing it from the temperature measured at a 
point on the compression curve in combination with accurate indicator 
diagrams. The experiment was made at the City and Guilds (Engineer- 
ing) College on the gas-engine already referred to. The engine 
is not of recent construction and therefore the compression ratio, viz. 
4'8, is low compared with the ratios of gas-engines of more modern 
construction. Dr. Coker and Mr. Scoble have measured the cyclical 
variation of temperature on a more modern engine constructed by 
the National Gas-Engine Company in 1907. This engine has a 
cylinder 7 inches in diameter and a stroke of 15 inches. The maxi- 
mum volume occupied by the charge is 5'8 times the minimum volume. 
The method adopted was to measure directly by means of a platinum 
couple the temperature at various points along the compression-curve 
and along part of the expansion-curve, but the highest temperature 
had still to be measured by using the charge itself as a gas-thermometer. 

PV . 

A value of f^c is selected fi'om a, point on the expansion-stroke, and 

the constant so found is used to calculate the higher temperatures. In 
this method it is unnecessary to make any calculation regarding the 
chemical contraction before and after explosion because the temperature 
is measured after the explosion, but the rate of change of temperature at 
the point where the temperature is measured is very great, and there- 
fore, in comparing the two methods, it is necessary to choose between 
a temperature measured when the rate of change is great with a 
corresponding lag and no correction for chemical contraction, as against 
a method of measuring the temperature when the rate of change is a 
minimum, viz. just after the closing of the suction-valve, and allowing

Application of the Work of the Committee to Practical Problevis. 

The application of the work of the Committee to practical problems 
can be illustrated in connection with the calculation^ of the heat ex- 
changed between the working agent and the walls of a gas-engine 
cylinder. 

First Law of Thermodynainics and the quantities necessary to apply 
it to determine heat lost or gained by the working charge during a 

change of state. 

Let A (fig. 14) be a point on the pressure volume diagram repre- 
senting the state of a working agent with regard to its pressure and 
volume. Let the state change along the path A, B, so that B repre- 
sents the state after the change. Then

J = 1,400. 

Earlier it was assumed that the specific heat of the gas used in the 
gas-engine cylinder was constant, and that the change of internal energy 
was determined by the change of temperature only. With this as- 
sumption the first term on the right-hand side of the equation was

that the specific heat is variable, and the Committee began their work 
by reviewing all the available experimental data in connexion with the 
subject. Several members of the Committee were themselves carry- 
ing out researches in relation tO' this problem at the same time. 

Data found to enable this Determinatiooi to be made. 

The aim of the Committee was to ascertain the true value of the 
specific heat at constant volume, Ky, or, to put it in another way, to 
ascertain the relation between the internal energy of the gas and its 
temperature. In dealing with gas-engine problems it is more 
convenient to combine equations (1) and (2) into a single expression in 
which the specific heat is given not in terms of the unit of mass, but 
in terms of the unit of volume at standard pressure and temperature. 
Substituting in equation (3) for the standard pressure, 1 atmosphere, 
for the standard temperature, 273° C. absolute, and for the gas con- 
stant, c = 96, it will be found that the weight of a cubic foot of the 
working agent at standard temperature and pressure is -081 lb., and 
therefore in terms of foot-pounds, and still assuming that the specific 
heat at constant volume is constant, equation (2) becomes, 



JQ = -081 JKv (change of temperature) -f Z.

REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 



The quantity O'OSl JKy represents the change of internal energy 
in foot-pounds per degi'ee change of temperature per cubic foot as 
measured at standard temperature and pressure. When Ky is variable 
and is a known function of T, say &lt;/&gt; (T), the term becomes 



0081 J &lt;^ (T) dT. 

Values of this expression in which the lower limit Ti is degrees 
Centigrade can be read off the curve given in fig. 15, which is taken 
from the first Eeport.

Fig. 15. 

To use this curve to find the internal energy corresponding to a 
given state-point it is necessary to measure the pressure P and 
volume V from a PV diagram, and also to determine the absolute 
temperature T. The corresponding volume at standard temperature 
and pressure is then calculated from the equation, 

VP To 
T P„ 

This calculated value of Vo when multiplied by the internal energy 
as given by the curve for the temperature T gives the internal 
energy of the gas corresponding to the given state-point. 

Symbolically let 

Ea = internal energy corresponding to the position of a state-point A. 

Va = the corresponding volume measured at A reduced to standard temperature 

and pressure, and 
Yi = the ordinate of the curve measured at the temperature corresponding to 

the temperature of the state-point, then 
Ea = Va. Yt 



ON GASEOUS EXPLOSIONS, 197 

The position of the points A and B on the PV diagram gives no 
indication of the temperature at A or B. If the temperature at one 
of the points, however, is known, then the temperature at the second 
point can be calculated from the relation 

Pa Va Pb Vb ... 

m =^ m ..... \^) 

This relation expresses the characteristic equation for gases, and is 
quite independent of the specific heat of the gases concerned. It 
applies to all positions of the state-point in the PV diagram provided 
that the following two conditions are satisfied: — 

Condition 1. That there is no change in density of the gas such as may be 
produced by some change in its chemical constitution. 

„ 2. That the weight of the working agent during the change of state 

from A to B is constant. 

It is fundamentally important, therefore, to be able to measure 
by direct observation the temperature corresponding to at least one 
position of the state-point in the diagram, because by means of this 
temperature and the relation expressed in equation (4) the temperature 
corresponding to any other position of the state-point in the diagram 
can be calculated, providing always that the conditions 1 and 2 are not 
violated during the change of state. If the first condition is violated 
there is a small change of volume caused by chemical action as the 
state-point moves from A to B, and in order to calculate the magnitude 
of this change it is necessary to have a chemical analysis of the 
gas before and after chemical action. When these analyses are known 
a correction can be made and equation (4) can still be applied to calcu- 
late the temperature. This kind of action has to be reckoned with, 
for example, if tlie state-point A is on the compression-curve of a gas- 
engine and the state-point B is on the expansion-curve. 

The earlier part of this report shows that the Committee have given 
a good deal of consideration to the subject of the direct measurement 
of temperature, and that individual members have worked at the 
problem successfully. Examples have been given earlier in the report 
of methods which have been applied and are being used in the 
researches which are now being carried out. This example shows how 
the equation (4) is used to calculate the temperature for different 
positions of the state-point B from observations of a single tempera- 
ture. The single temperature which it is most useful to know is the 
suction-temperature, and this may be defined as the temperature of the 
charge in the cylinder just after the admission valve is closed. There 
is then a definite weight of charge in the cylinder at a definite 
pressure and volume, and at a definite temperature. Allowing for 
the chemical contraction, equation (4) can be applied along the expan- 
sion-curve. 

The C'onnnittee have examined into the question of leak of charge, 
and have come to the conclusion that in most cases in a modern 
engine it is a negligible amount when proper precautions are taken. 



198 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 

These considerations show how important the suction temperature is 
in combination with the indicator diagram, as from this temperature 
and the pressure and volume given by the diagram the state of the 
working agent all through the cycle can be determined, at least 
approximately. 

The values of the suction temperature for a particular engine are 
exhibited in fig. 12 above, and a diagram of the kind would be useful 
in connexion with any internal-combustion motor. 

To resume, it can now be assumed that it is possible to fix a 
temperature for one particular position of the state-point A, and then 
the temperature at the end of the change of state B, if not observed, 
can be calculated. With a knowledge of those temperatures the 
internal energy of the working agent can be read oft from the cui-ve 
(fig. 16), and then the first term on the right side of the equation, viz. 

Eb — Ea = change of internal energy 

is determined. 

The value of the second term on the right side of equation (1) is 
merely the value of the shaded area under the path AB expressed in 
foot-pounds. Consequently, from a pressure-volume diagram giving the 
initial and final conditions of the working agent and the path of the 
state-point in between, together with the temperature corresponding to 
one position of the state-point, the right side of the equation can be 
determined and the heat gained or lost by the working agent during 
the change can therefore be computed. If there is no gain or loss 
of heat the work done is done at the expense of the internal energy 
of the working agent itself. One of the main objects of the Committee 
has been to extend our knowledge of the physical constants of the 
gases by the careful examination of methods, apparatus, and results of 
various investigators, including members of the Committee, and change 
of state of the working charge in a gas-engine can now be followed 
with a degree of accuracy which hitherto has been impossible. 

A diagram from an actual gas-engine shows the PV changes during 
the whole of the four-stroke cycle, but the method explained above 
can only be applied to determine the heat exchanges during that part 
of the cycle when the weight of charge enclosed in the cylinder is 
constant — i.e. during the period between the closing of the suction- 
valve and the opening of the exhaust-valve. There is no difficulty 
in applying the method practically to a change of state along the com- 
pression-curve because the conditions 1 and 2 above are fulfilled. 
There is no chemical change and the weight of charge is constant. 
Applying the method to the analysis of the expansion-curve, however, 
there is difficulty. The left side of equation (1), Q, gives the heat 
gained or lost by the gas during a change of state. Q includes the heat 
gained by combustion as well as the heat gained or lost from outside, so 
that it must be written 

Q = 0-hC 
where represents the heat gained or lost to the outside, and C repre- 



ON GASEOUS EXPLOSIONS. 199 

sents the heat produced by combustion during the change. The diffi- 
culty is to separate these two during a change of state along the 
expansion-line. It is probable that combustion is not quite com- 
plete at the point of maximum pressure ; in fact some combustion may 
be going on right up to the point at which the exhaust-valve opens. 
If, therefore, two points are taken on the expansion-curve and this 
method of analysis is applied, neglecting 0, the heat loss determined 
will obviously be too great. 

An analysis of the diagram by this method will be found in Dr. 
Clerk's Gustave Canet lecture, and need not, therefore, be further 
pursued. 

Attention may be specially drawn to the cun'es in fig. 12, which 
show the results of trials made for the purpose of ascertaining the 
relationship between the suction temperature and the strength of the 
mixture used and on the speed. When the mixture is 9 parts of air and 
1 part of gas by volume the suction-temperature is about 70° C. at 
a speed of 100 revs, per minute. At 200 revs, per minute the suction 
temperature is increased to 78i° 0. At the constant speed of 200 revs. 
per minute the temperature gradually increases as the mixture becomes 
richer ; with a 10 to 1 mixture the temperature is 75° 0. , and this 
increases to 96^° 0. with a 6 to 1 mixture. At the lower speed the 
change in temperature is almost as great for a corresponding change 
in the mixture, namely from 67i° C. to 82° 0. With a modern engine 
using a hij];her compression it is probable that the temperatures would 
be generally higher. Fig. 13 shows the cyclical variation of tempera- 
ture as determined by Dr. Coker on a more modern engine, and the 
suction temperatures given by him are of the order of 200° 0. Dr. 
Coker explains this high suction temperature as being partly due to the 
retention of hot gas and partly due to the long exhaust-pipe which was 
used. 

Dalby and Callendar's experiments have shown that when using 
rich mixtures the maximum temperature in the cylinder is probably 
about 2000° C, and these results have been confirmed by Coker and 
Scoble. For the mixtures used in ordinary working conditions the 
experiments of Dalby, Callendar, Coker, and Scoble show that the 
temperature is about 1800° C. It is hoped to continue the experiments 
on temperature measurements when engines of more modern construc- 
tion have been installed in the new engine laboratory of the City and 
Guilds (Engineering) College. 

The concentration of research on the accurate measurement of 
temperature is a necessary step towards a more certain knowledge of 
the specific heat of gases at high temperatures; and the vital import- 
ance of this subject is indicated by the brief explanation given above of 
the method by which the determination of heat exchange between the 
working charge and the walls of the cylinder can be made. So far the 
Committee have only been able to present the curves given in fig. 15 
as representing the most reliable data available. The practical use to 
which the curve can be put is illustrated by using the data given 
by it to find the efficiency of an engine working on the Otto 
cycle without loss of heat assuming that the mixture used is that

The Committee are of opinion that they can usefully continue their 
work by organising research on the lines which have been foreshadowed 
in this report. The Committee recommend, therefore, that they be 
again re-appointed, and that, in view of the expensive nature of the 
research and the organisation involved, the sum of lOOZ. be granted 
to them.

Stress Distributions in Engineering Materials.— Report cf the 
Committee, consisting of Professor J. Perry (Chairman), 
Professors E. G. Coker and J. E. Petavel (Secretaries), 
Professor A. Barr, Dr. C. Chreb, Mr. Gilbert Cook, Pro- 
fessor W. E. Daley, Sir J. A. Ewing, Professor L. N. G-. 
PiLON, Messrs. A. E. Fulton and J. J. Guest, Professors 
J. B. Henderson and A. E. H. Love, Mr. W. Mason, Sir 
Andrew Noble, Messrs. F. Eogers arid W. A. Scoble, Dr. 
T. E. Stanton, and Mr. J. S. Wilson, to report on Certain 
of the More Complex Stress Distributions in Engineering 
Materials. 

The reports presented at the Birmingham Meeting of the Association 
led the Committee to the view that the co-ordination of the results of 
various researches was rendered difficult by the diversity of the materials 
used in the tests. It was therefore thought desirable to obtain complete 
and systematic data with regard to three definite materials, namely, 
a mild steel, a '3 per cent, carbon steel, and a steel alloy. 

In accordance with a resolution passed at the meeting of December 19, 
1913, a stock of three tons standard steel has been obtained for the Com- 
mittee by Dr. F. Eogers. This consists of : — (1) Dead mild steel (carbon 
•12 per cent.) ; (2) Axle steel (carbon "3 per cent.) ; (3) Nickel steel 

Some of the steel has already been sent to various members of the 
Committee, and in due course full information will be available with 
regard to the behaviour of the three materials under a large number of 
different tests. 

The mild steel was kindly presented to the Committee by Messrs. 
Steel, Peech, and Tozer, and the axle steel by Messrs. Taylor Bros. 

Information with regard to the manufacture of the standard steels 
is given in an Appendix. 

A report on the ' Experimental Determination of the Distribution 
of Stress and Strain in Sohds ' has been presented by Professors Coker 
and Filon. 

A paper on the ' Internal Stresses in a Built-up Steel Compression 



ON STRESS DISTRIBUTIONS IN ENGINEERING MATERIALS. 201 

Member,' by Mr. H. Delepine, has been communicated by Professor 
Petavel, and will be read at the meeting. 

A number of members of the Committee have, during the past year, 
been engaged on subjects dealt with in last year's report, but in most 
cases the experimental work is not yet completed. 

The subjects under investigation are the following : — 

Professor Coker and Mr. Scoble : Shear Tests. 

Mr. Cook : Tests of the Physical Constants of the Standard Steels. 

Messrs. Cook and Robertson : Further Work on the Strength of Thick 
Cyhnders. 

Mr. Fulton : Alternating Stress at Low Frequencies. 

Mr. Guest and Professors Dixon and Lea : Combined Stresses. 

Mr. Mason : Repeated Combined Stresses. 

Dr. Rogers : Alternating Stress, Heat Treatment, and Microscopical 
Examination. 

Mr. Scoble : Repeated Combined Stresses. 

Dr. Stanton : Repeated Shear Tests. 

Mr. Mason has installed, in the Engineering Laboratory at the Uni- 
versity of Liverpool, a machine specially designed for experimental work 
on alternating bending, alternating torsion, and simultaneous alternating 
bending and torsion. He has also constructed an apparatus for measure- 
ment of hysteresis. 

Dr. Stanton has made arrangements to test the standard steels, firstly 
by reversals of simple shearing stress, then by superimposing bending 
and direct stresses. 

Mr. Guest and Professors Dixon and Lea have completed the erection 
of their apparatus, and are engaged in preliminary experimental work. 

The Committee ask to be re-appointed with a grant of 100?. 

Appendix. 
Outline of Manufacture of the Standard Steels. 
By Dr. F. Rogers. 

No. 1 Steel. (12 per cent. Carbon.) 

The materials used in the manufacture of this steel are hematite pig 
iron, steel scrap and ore of the purest descriptions, melted very carefully 
in the acid open hearth furnace. 

The composition is adjusted by the addition of ferro-manganese, 
after which the metal is cast into ingot-moulds. The ingots are then 
rolled, with several heatings, into bars, which are reeled when black-hot, 
giving a straightening and burnishing effect without injuring the steel. 

This metal is suitable for high-class mild steel. 

The bars supphed to the Committee are the whole usable portion of 
two ingots, and weigh nearly 22^ cwts. 

No. 2 steel ('3 per cent, carbon). 

Report not yet received. 

No. 3 steel (Sg per cent, nickel).

Experimental Determination of the Distribution of Stress and Strain 

in Solids. By Professors Filon and Coker. 
Very httle has been done hitherto in the way of determining directly the 
distribution of stresses and strains in the interior of an elastic sohd. The 



202 



EEPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 



investigations whicli have been made deal almost exclusively with the 
more restricted case of two-dimensional stress and strain, or of stress and 
strain in a thin plate parallel to the faces of the plate itself, a problem 
known to elasticians as that of ' generahsed plane stress.' ' 

In these cases two methods have proved available. The first method 
consists in measuring directly the deformations of the body studied, 
by observing the actual distortion of a face of the sohd parallel to the 
plane of strain. In practice this may be done by ruhng this face into 
squares and observing, with a kathetometer or micrometer, the relative 
shifts of various parts of the network. From these, the extent by which 
the angle at a node of the network has been changed from a right angle 
can easily be found, and this quantity, as is well known, measures the 
shearing strain (or ' shde,' according to a terminology followed by many 
writers on elasticity, who reserve the word ' shear ' to denote the shearing- 
stress). 

In this way values of the shearing-strain are obtained at the various 
nodes of the network. Again, the changes of distance between adjacent

nodes can be found, and from these, if the squares of the network are 
sufficiently small, the extensions at the various nodes, parallel to the 
hues of the net, can be obtained. 

The plane-strain can, therefore, be mapped out over the whole face of 
the sohd which is xmder observation. If this method is to give satis- 
factory results it must be appUed to materials where the strains are 
comparatively large. It has been apphed with considerable success by 
Professor Karl Pearson (1) and various workers associated with him to 
models of dams constructed of gelatine-glycerine jelly, and in tliis way 
various results of interest in the theory of masonry dams have been 
obtained, although it cannot be said that the complete system of stresses 
in such dams is yet known with any certainty. In other cases measure- 
ments of the distortions produced in circles described on the face of a 
model have been used to determine the principal strains and their direc- 
tions, as in the experiments of Messrs. Wilson and Gore (2). 

Dr. E. N. da C. Andrade (3) has also employed a block of jelly to 
investigate the distribution of slide in such a block when two of its opposite 

' Love, Theory of Elasticity, p. 135, 



ON STRESS DISTRIBUTIONS IN ENGINEERING MATERIALS. 203 

faces AB, CD (Pig. 1) constrained to remain plane and parallel and un- 
disturbed are given a translatory displacement relative to each other, 
parallel to their plane. 

Dr. Andrade found that along the middle plane EF of the block (half- 
way, that is, between the two faces whose displacement was prescribed) 
the distribution of shde gave two maxima at points H, K distant about 
one-sixth of the length from the unstressed faces perpendicular to the 
plane of strain, the shde falhng gradually to a minimum at 0. 

For a section E' F' near the middle plane an effect of the same type 
occurred, but was less marked. For a section E" F" near the face CD 
where the constraint was appHed the slide remained fairly uniform over 
the greater part of the length of the section, going down rapidly at the 
ends to the value zero at CD. 

The problem attacked experimentally by Dr. Andrade is one of which 
no exact theoretical solution is known. Dr. Andrade himself attempted 
to fit his conditions by an approximate solution, but either through the 
failure of the approximation, or from some other cause, the results of 
observation and calculation agreed only quahtatively. 

The second method used for the investigation of the distribution of 
stresses inside a plate subjected to stress in its own plane depends on the 
property, discovered by Sir David Brewster in 1816, and independently 
t3y Fresnel, that glass and other isotropic transparent substances become 
doubly refracting under stress. 

Since then this effect has been studied by a number of observers (4). 
It may be taken as fairly well estabhshed that when a ray of polarised 
light traverses a plate stressed in its own plane, it is broken up into two 
components, polarised along the two hues of principal stress at the point 
where the ray crosses the plate, and the relative retardation of these two 
rays on emergence in air is 

Ct(P-Q), 

where t = thickness of the plate, P and Q are the two principal mean 
stresses in the plane of the plate, and C is a co-efficient depending upon 
the material and the wave-length of the Ught (5). 

Clerk Maxwell (6) was the first to go fairly fully into the theory of the 
appearances presented when a plate under varjdng stress in its own plane 
is placed between crossed Nicols. He showed that the hght is restored 
at all points except those for which : 

(a) The fines of principal stress are parallel to the axes of the Nicols. 

Since the condition for extinction of the fight is here independent of 
the wave-length, these hnes will be qmte black. These may be called the 
fines of equal incfination or isocfinic fines. 

(6) The principal stress-difference has such a value that Cr(P— Q) is an 
exact multiple of the wave-length. 

These will be fines of equal principal stress-difference, and will give 
a different set of fines for different wave-lengths. They are thus, in 
general, brilhantly coloured, the same stress-difference corresponding 
to the same tint. The only exception is the hne corresponding to P — Q=0. 

These may be called (follo\ving Maxwell) the isochromatic hnes, the 
black hne corresponding to P— Q=0 being called the neutral fine. 

Observations of the isocfinic fines fiave the advantage that these lines 
are exhibited under comparatively small stress and are independent of 
the co-efficient C. Their use does not, therefore, require straining the 



204 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 

material to an extent likely to produce permanent set, and they can be 
shown by comparatively tliiu sjiecimeus. Also they do not require any 
previous investigation of the co-efficient C for the given material, or of its 
dependence upon the wave-length. 

In theory observation of the isochnic hues is sufficient to determine 
the stress system, provided we have information as to the actual stresses 
at a very limited number of points (7). Such information is generally 
available from the known boundary conditions. 

On the other hand, the calculations required to actually deduce the 
stresses from the isochnic hues are comphcated, and are very difficult 
to apply to cases where the data are expressed by purely empirical curves. 
The isochnic hues are, therefore, better suited to experimental verifica- 
tion of stress distribution already known from theory, and for which the 
theoretical isochnic hues can be calculated beforehand and compared 
with observation. They have been so used by M. Corbino and Trabacchi 
(8) using rings of gelatine to verify Volterra's (9) theory of internal strains 
in a multiply connected elastic sohd ; and also by Filon (10), who used 
glass beams to verify the ordinary theory of stresses in a beam at a distance 
from points of isolated loading, and also his own theory of the distribution 
of stress in a beam near a point of isolated loading. Both Corbino and 
Trabacchi, and Filon found that their experimental results confirmed the 
predictions of the theory of elasticity (11). Cams Wilson (12), who used 
in his investigation both the isochnic and the isochromatic hues, was the 
first to aj)ply the optical method to discover the laws of stress distribution 
in a glass beam, doubly supported and centrally loaded. 

He gives a drawing of the fines of principal stress in such a beam, but 
does not use them further, and restricts his comparison of theory with 
experiment, to the stresses in the cross-section immediately under the load ; 
the theory with which he compares his results was originally given by 
Boussinesq (13), and treats the height of the beam as infinitely thick. Sir 
G. Gr. Stokes gave, in a note to Carus Wilson's paper, an empirical correc- 
tion to Boussinesq's theory. An exact theory of tliis problem has since 
been given by Filon (14). 

The use of the isochromatic fines and generaUy of experiments de- 
pending upon tint has this advantage, that it pelds directly the value 
of the stress-difference P— Q. If this be combined with a determination 
of the direction of principal stress at each point, then considerable direct 
information is given at once, and some cases of practical importance have 
been examined by Honigsberg and Dimmer (15). 

The determination both of P— Q and of the directions of principal 
stress may be combined in one measurement, which is very simply made 
by means of an apparatus due to Coker (16). Coker uses a thin celluloid 
plate, cut to represent an engineering structure in which it is desired to 
investigate the stresses. This is a more easily worked material than glass, 
and a lesser thickness is required, as its stress-optical co-efficient is con- 
siderable. To obtain a measure of the stress-difference at any point a 
tension member is placed in front of the strained model, in a direction 
corresponding to one of the principal axes of stress, and the colour effect 
produced in the loaded model is neutrafised by applying a sufficient load 
to this cahbrating member. The tensional stress T affords a measure of 
the difference of the principal stresses (P— Q) subject to a small correction 
when (P— Q) and T have different signs. 

An improved way of doing this, which saves these repeated adjust- 



ON STRESS DISTRIBUTIONS IN ENGINEERING MATERIALS. 205 

ments of T, is to use a test-piece under pure flexure (without sliear) in its 
own plane. This can be readily produced in a straining frame as in the 
accompanying diagram. The stress will then vary linearly from P to Q 
and may be read off along a scale PQ, which can be previously caUbrated 
against a specimen under known tension. 

A httle sideways shift of the test-plate is then all that is required to 
compensate the stress-difference at any given point, provided that the 
direction of principal stress had been found previously. 

Coker has used a cahbration tension member to determine the distribu- 
tion of stress in plates of various shapes — for example, in tension specimens 




Fig. 2. 

pierced with circular holes, decks of ships with various openings, cement 
briquettes, &amp;c. (17). He has also (18) investigated Andrade's problem 
of the block whose opposite faces slide with regard to one another re- 
maining undistorted, and he obtains by this optical method a distribution 
of shear very similar to that obtained by Andrade from direct measure- 
ments of the shde. Mr. Scoble and he have also appHed this method to 
determine the distribution of stress due to a rivet in a plate (19). 

The photo-elastic determination of stress carried out in this way does 
not, however, determine the stress in the plate completely. It will be 
noticed that all the method gives is the principal stress-difference at any 
point. If each principal stress at a given point be increased by any 
arbitrary quantity, the appearances are in no wise altered. To obviate 
this, Coker has used the stretch-squeeze effect in the plate to measure 
the sum P— Q of the principal stresses, a suggestion due originally to 
Mesnager (20). For clearly, if r be the thickness of the plate, -q Poisson's 
ratio, the plate, at the point where the principal stresses are P, Q, will 
become thinner by an amount '7t(P-j-Q) an amount which is small, 
but with dehcate instruments not impossible to measure. 

It will be noticed that this provides yet a third method for exploring 
the field of stress in a plate. 

There is, however, no necessity for doing this, as the information 
derived from the known values of the stress-difference and the direction 
of the hnes of principal stress can be readily applied to find the complete 
system of stresses. 

Let the axes of x and y be taken in the plane of the plate. Let P and 
Q now denote the normal stresses across elements dij and dx respectively, 
S the shearing stress across either of the above elements. Then, if the 



206 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 

lines of principal stress make an angle a with tlie axes, and if R is the 
principal stress-dift'erence, it is well known that 

P— Q=R cos 2a 
2S=R sin 2a. 

Thus a determination of R and a at every point leads to the value 
of S at all points. 

On the other hand, considering the equihbrium of a small rectangle 
dx, dy and neglecting body-forces, we have the well-known body stress 
equations for generahsed plane strain, 

Sec hy ' Sx 8y 

Now, at a point of the boundary, all the stresses will be known. 
For the normal stress across an element of the boundary where the 
outwards normal makes an angle with the axis of x is 

P cos2 e + Q sin2 (9+2S cos 6 sin 6 

= P + Q + ^-Q cos 26 + 8 sin 20. 

S and P— Q being known from optical data, and the normal stress across 
the boundary being also known from the boundary conditions, the above 
equation determines P+Q and hence (P— Q being known) P and Q. 

Consider now a point A of the plate. Draw a hne through A parallel 
to the axis of x to meet the nearest boundary at a point Ao (iCo, yf). 

Then, integrating the equation 

SP . ^^Q 

8a; hy 

along the hne Ay A, we find 

P-P„=-jlS.^a;, 

where Po is the value of P at A,,. 

Similarly, if a hne through A parallel to the axis of y meets the nearest 
boundary at a point Bq (jc, ?/o) when the value of Q is Qo, 



V 

Q-Qo = — Yx ' ^y' 



l/o 

Now, if we know the value of S at all points, the values of the partial 
differential co-efficients g-. g- can be obtained approximately by 

taking differences. P and Q can then be found as above by the ordinary 
process of graphical integration, Pn, Qo being known, as explained. This 
method can be used with any set of experimental data, provided only that 
these are accurate enough to allow of differences beine taken to calculate 
SS 8S 
g-&gt; g-. In any case, before actually aj^plyingthe method, the curves for 

S when eitlier x = constant or y = constant should be ' smoothed ' so 



ON STRESS DISTRIBUTIONS IN ENGINEERING MATERIALS. 207 

as to take out accidental inequalities. A check on the accuracy of the 
calculation is easily pro\aded, for the calculated P — Q should agree with 
the value optically observed. 

In many problems it is known that one of the normal stresses is through- 
out very small. In this case, if Q, say, is nearly zero, we have P=R cos 2a, 
and the stress chfference leads easily to the complete system of stresses. 
This assumption has been made by Coker in his earher papers, but it 
would seem desirable to justify it more fully.

The terms in a ^ 8 do not affect the stresses and may be dropped. 

The term y i rj may add y to P+Q. 

If, now, the value of any stress be known at a given point, this leads 
to a hnear equation between A, B, C, D, y. 

Hence the complete specification of the stress at two points leads to 
six equations for A, B, C, D, y in hke manner, if we consider the conditions 
at the boundary, where two of the stresses are in general known, the con- 
ditions at three points give six equations. In either case we have more 
than enough equations to determine A, B, C, D, y. 

Thus the stress conditions at a few points, together with the isochnio 
lines, determine the stress system completely.

The Lake Villages in the Neighbourhood of Glastonbury. — 
Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor W. Boyd 
Dawkins {Chairman), ]\Ir. Willoughby Gardner {Secre- 
tary), Professor W. Ridgeway, Sir Arthur J. Evans, Sir C. 
Hercules Read, Mr. H. Balfour, and Mr. A. Bulleid, 
appointed to investigate the Lake Villages in the Neighbour- 
hood of Glastonbury in conneetion with a Committee of the 
Somersetshire Archaeological and Natural History Society. 
{Drawn up by Mr. Arthur Bulleid and Mr. H. St. George 
Gray, the Directors of the Excavations.) 

The fifth season's exploration of the Meare Lake Village by the 
Somersetshire Archseological and Natural History Society began on 
May 13, 1914, and will be continued until May 27 (exclusive of filling 
in). The ground being excavated is situated in the same field and is 
continuous with the work of previous years. As the report has to be 
sent in on May 22, while the excavations are in progress, any notes 
regarding the work will necessarily be incomplete and curtailed. There 
has been considerable difficulty this year in procuring labour, and it 
is proposed to reopen the excavations in September. The digging 
includes the examination of the ground situated to the north-east of 
Dwelling-Mound V., south-east of Dwelling-Mound VII., the south- 
west quarter of Dwelling-Mound IX., and the ground lying to the 
north-east of Dwelling-Mound XVIII. There is little of interest, so 
far, to note structurally, but the number and importance of the objects 
found have been well maintained. 

The Eelics. 

This report is called for before the season's work is half completed, 
and at a time when the excavators are only on the fringe of two well- 
defined dwelling-mounds. Hence there is little to say with regard 
to the relics so far discovered. 

Bone. — The bone objects include part of two needles, worked tibiae 
of sheep and ox, tarsal and carpal bones of sheep, cut and perforated 



THE LAKE VILLAGES IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF GLASTONBURY. 211 

shoulder-blades, polishing-bones ; and a long tubular die with numbers, 
3, 4, 5, 6, represented by small circular depressions on the sides, 
and of a similar variety to those found in the Glastonbury Lake Village ; 
also a piece of bone cut for the formation of two dice. A bone object 
of a new type is the coarse comb of rude workmanship fonned from 
a rib-bone of ox or horse; there are eight large, clumsy teeth of varied 
size, which bear evidence of considerable wear ; it is quite of a different 
character from the weaving-combs so frequently found in the lake 
villages. 

Crucibles. — Several fragments. 

Bronze. — The bronze objects include a piece of bordering, two 
fibulge of safety-pin design (La Tene XXL), one in almost perfect 
condition, and a small ornamented ring-handle, perhaps of a vessel. 
A long tubular object formed from a strip of sheet bronze was also 
found, the working-end of which is trifurcated by splitting the metal 
for a distance of about f inch, each of the divisions tapering to form 
a three-pointed instrument. 

Iron. — Parts of knives and fragments of pointed objects. 

Flint. — A few flint flakes, some with secondary chipping. 

Glass. — A perfect bead of clear white glass, ornamented with three 
sunk spiral devices filled with a light yellow paste, has 'been added 
to the bead series ; and others have been found in addition. 

Antler. — Part of a polished tine, a small tubular object, a cut piece 
with partial perforations, two weaving-combs, 'cheek-pieces,' and 
tool-handles. 

Kimmeridge SJiale. — Part of a fluted armlet of large size, lathe- 
turned; and portions of three others. 

Tusks. — Several boars' tusks (? -wild), including one perforated. 

Querns. — No complete upper or lower stone has been found, but 
several large portions of well-worked saddle and rotary querns have 
been uncovered in Mound IX. 

Other Stone Objects. — Several sling-stones, found singly; a large 
number of whetstones ; a few small smooth pebbles (perhaps calculi). 

Spindle-whorls. — Six have been found so far, (a) one of baked clay, 
[b) four of lias stone, (c) a part of one formed from an ammonite. 

Baked Clay. — Several sling-bullets O'f fusiform shape have been 
collected; also a large triangular loom-weight and fragments of others 
in Mound IX. 

Pottery. — No complete vessel has been found, but shards are very 
abundant in proportion to the area dug. The rougher wares are strongly 
represented, 'but a fair number of ornamented pieces have been 
collected, including some new and elegant designs. Part of an orna- 
mented pot-cover of a type previously found at Meare has been found ; 
also at least two separate fragments of Eoman ware of the ' Burtle 
type,' obtained from below the alluvial deposits and on the original 
surface of Roman times. 

Animal Remains. — Large quantities of bones of domesticated 
animals are being collected, chiefly of young animals. Many split 
bones and splinters have been noticed. Bird-bones are also commonly 
found. A cock-spur has also come to light at Mearc, which implies that

the sport of cock-fighting, common in Gaul before the Roman conquest, 
was carried on in the lake village of Meare, as well as in that of 
Glastonbury. 

The Committee are desirous that they should be authorised to act 
fpr the ensuing year on the part of the British Association, and that 
a grant of 20L should be made in aid of the exploration that is mostly 
paid for by local effort. 



Physical Characters of the Ancient Egyptians. — Rejwrt of the 
Committee, consisting of Professor G-. Elliot Smith {Chair- 
man), Dr. F. C. Shrubsall (Secretary), Professor A. Keith, 
Dr. F. Wood Jones, and Dr. C. G. Seligmann. 

Professor Elliot Smith's Report. 

This report deals with two distinct series of anthropological material, 
(A) one from Saqqara in Lower Egypt, and (B) the other from the 
Southern part of the Kerma basin in the Sudan. Both collections 
are of quite exceptional importance from their bearing upon the 
history and the racial movements in the Nile Valley. 

(A.) The Committee was appointed primarily with the object of 
acquiring, studying, and, if feasible, transporting to England a valuable 
and unique series of skeletons of Ancient Egyptians, buried in mastabas 
of the Second and Third Dynasties at Saqqara, which Sir Gaston 
Maspero, Director-General of the Egyptian Government Antiq_uities 
Department, had placed at my disposal. The material was -brought 
to light in the course of the excavations carried on for the Antiquities 
Department by its Senior Inspector, Mr. J. E. Quibell, who did 
everything in his power to facilitate and help me in my investigations. 
The cemetery in which the material was obtained is situated a short 
distance to the north of the Pyramids of Saqqara, and included the 
tomb of Hesy, from which the famous wooden portrait panels (now 
in the Cairo Museum) were obtained by Mariette Pasha many years 
ago. The tombs themselves are of very great interest, and will be 
described in detail in Mr. Quibell 's official report,^ a summary of 
which was read at the Dimdee Meeting. They are the earliest known 
examples of elaborate subterranean rock-cut tombs, and range in date 
from the latter part of the Second Dynasty until well into the period 
of the Third Dynasty. At the Dundee Meeting of the Association I 
read Mr. Quibell 's account of this cemetery, from which the following 
extracts ^ have been taken : — 

' This is the area in which Mariette found most of his mastabas, 
from which much of the knowledge of the Old Kingdom has been 
obtained. '

^ These extensive quotations, not published hitherto, are necessary to explain 
the importance and precise significance of the anthropological questions involved 
in the study of the material, to the consideration of which I shall return in the 
latter part of tliis report. 



ON PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. 213 

' More than 400 tombs were dug and recorded : they were singularly 
uniform in type and cover but a small period in time. Four were of 
the First Dynasty, and the rest of the Second and Third. Intrusive 
burials of later ages were confined to two periods, that of Thotmes III. 
and (probably) late Ptolemaic, and were unimportant.' 

' In what follows we w-ill confme ourselves to the Second and Third 
Dynasties : — 

' These tombs were most varied in size, but uniform in plan. One 
was 50 metres long and 30 wide, but the one I have chosen as a type 
was no more than li metres long, and even originally not 1 metre 
high. It consists of a hollow oblong of imbaked brickwork filled in 
with gravel and stone chip, plastered and whitewashed externally. 
On the east side are two niches, the southern one being the larger and 
the more important. Below the mastaba was a small stairway and a 
subterranean chamber. The smaller tombs were often built in rows, 
and their position parallel with the sides of the larger ones suggested 
that they belonged to the servants or relatives of the great men. 

' One tomb showed very clearly the origin of the later type in 
stone. The niche has been withdrawn into the body of the building 
and protected by a door. A small chamber is thus formed, and the 
sides of this were, no doubt, decorated with paintings ; later, when 
stone replaced the crude brick, the scenes were made in low relief. 
This is the form of most of the mastabas published by Mariette ; the 
more complex plans of the large tombs that have been left open are 
exceptional. 

' The paths between the tombs were very narrow, hardly wide 
enough for one man to pass, and among the larger tombs, where there 
were walls 3 metres and more high, must have formed a perilous 
maze. They were umcli used; offerings of minute quantities of food 
were brought on every feast day and placed before the false doors in 
little vases like egg-cups and saucers. Piles of these pots are found 
thrown away near some of the tombs. 

' Very little stone-work was found. Small tanks 20 centimetres 
or so long occasionally remained before the niches, and in two cases 
an inscribed stone panel depicting the deceased seated before his table 
of offerings had escaped the search for lime. This panel appears in 
the middle of the later stelse of the Fifth Dynasty, of which it was 
evidently the most important part. 

' The sides of the niches may have borne painted decoration — 
probably did so — but no trace of this remained. 

' In one mastaba, a very large one, the wall was double: the two 
niches wei'e carefully built in both the inner and the outer walls, 
evidently in order that the inner one might retain its magical value, 
even if the outer one were destroyed. 

' The space inside the four walls was generally filled with gravel 
and with stone chip from the subterranean chamber, but in some of 
the larger tombs the filling contained also a great number of coarse 
vases, many crushed by the overlying gravel, but many also unbroken. 
These we thought at first might have been the jars used by the work- 
men for food, but some of them were of unbaked clay, and could hardly 



214 REPORTS ON THE STATE OP SCIENCE. — 1914. 

have been used at all. In other cases, too, these vases had been 
placed in orderly rows ; in one the whole desert floor between the 
walls of the tomb and the edge of the shaft had been covered with 
these vases, with clods of black clay placed between them. It would 
seem, then, that these were deposits intended to supplement the 
furniture of the subterranean chamber. 

' In the case here shown there can be little doubt. Below the 
filling, hidden beneath 3 metres of gravel, we found a shallow trench 
^ mfetre wide, once roofed with wood. Inside it were two rows of 
jars or model bams, each 30 centimetres high, made of unbaked clay, 
and containing a brown organic powder, probably decayed corn. The 
trench is lined with brick, and from it a tiny tunnel, a handbreadth 
wide and high, leads to the mouth of the shaft. This, surely, was a 
secret supply of food for the dead man. 

' In thi'ee of the large tombs a still more elaborate provision was 
made. A row of brick chambers, or tanks, was sunk in the floor of 
the tomb, filled with jars, and covered with a course of brick. What 
the jars contained is not clear; a very light organic matter, probably 
a fat, filled the lower half of a few, but most of them were empty when 
found. These chambers, or tanks, must, however, have once contained 
something of value, for in one tomb they had been laboriously robbed. 
A shaft had been sunk through the filling — in this case composed of a 
very tough, dried mud — into one of the chambers, and from this 
tunnels bad been forced, sometimes through the walls, sometimes 
above them through the mud filling, tdl all the eight chambers had 
been rifled. The labour must have been considerable and the risk not 
trifling: there was nothing to show how it had been repaid. 

' We now leave the structures above ground and come to the shaft. 

' This was nearly always in the form of a stair, sloping down 
from the north or east to the chamber mouth. The stair often starts 
from the east, near the north niche, and bends at a I'ight-angle half- 
way down ; this would be practically useful while the digging was 
going on, as it would stop a falling stone before it acquired an 
awkward velocity. The shafts, like the tombs, vary much in size. 
Some are 12 metres deep, som.e so small — 1 metre or less — that 
the steps would be of no practical use. 

' In the larger and deeper tombs the steps are cut in the rock, are 
of reasonable size, and evidently served their purpose in the excavation 
of the chamber below; but in many of the moderate sized mastabas, 
those 4 to 5 metres long, the steps are of brick, and are too narrow 
and fragile for a man to stand on them. Shafts and steps in the 
small tombs, and presumably also in the large ones, were carefully 
plastered and whitewashed for the funeral ceremony. In small tombs 
a low skirting wall a few inches in height was built round the shaft, 
and this, too, was whitened. The ui^per part, the mastaba, was built 
after the funeral. But in larger tombs this was not practical; the 
works above and below ground had to go on together, so the stair 
was fenced in by a separate wall. 

' Shafts were generally filled with gravel, the portcullis being relied 
on to secure the mouth of the chamber ; but in large tombs they were 



ON PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OP THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. 215 

filled with slabs of stone, packed in on edge, and in some cases a 
pavement of lieavy blocks was laid in above. A few stone vases were 
occasionally placed in the shaft, and in one tomb a great number had 
been laid on the steps of the stair. The same arrangement was found 
by Garstang in a great tomb at Bet Khallaf. 

' The portcullis consisted of a large flat block of stone with 
rounded edges, sometimes as much as 3 metres long and 1'5 metres 
wide, which fitted into a gi-oove cut in the rock. It nmsfc have been 
lowered before the mastaba was built and chocked up so that its base 
was above the door of the chamber. Eopes were used to aid in 
lowering it; the channels cut by them were observed in one stone. 

' The chamber opened either on the south or west, very rarely the 
north, never on the east. 

' It was generally a small, rudely-cut cave, too small to hold a 
body laid at full length ; this small rough chamber was the general 
rule, but the larger tombs have a series of chambers of a somewhat 
elaborate plan. 

' On passing the portcullis in these we find ourselves in a broad 
passage, from which three or four chambers, probably magazines, 
open on each side. 

' A wide doorway at the end leads to a continuation of the passage, 
and this to further chambers, in which there is some variety of plan; 
but two features are constant. To the right — that is, to the S.W. — 
is the actual burial chamber with remains of a single skeleton ; in the 
S.-E. corner is a feature new in Egyptian tombs, and, surely, in any 
other tombs — viz., a dummy latrine; north of this, in two cases, was 
a narrow chamber with rude basins carved in the floor — probably 
meant for a bathroom. The provision for the dead was evidently more 
thoughtful and complete than in later ages. 

' In all these underground chambers the antiquities found were 
somewhat disappointing. It is true that we did obtain a great number 
of bowls and dishes of alabaster, diorite, and other stones — indeed, an 
emban'assing quantity of them — also ewers and basins of copper, 
occasionally a wooden piece from a draughtsboard, a box or a bit of 
ivory inlay, and that the mud-seals on the vases were in three tombs 
inscribed with Kings' names, thereby giving us our assured dates for 
the cemetery ; but the ancient robbers had very different returns for 
their labour; there had certainly i^een quite other classes of monuments 
of which no sample had survived. All the tombs except the very 
smallest and poorest had been robbed, and robbed, too, at a very early 
period : this was clear from the knowleclge shown by the robbers of 
the construction, and the skill with which they penetrated to the burial 
chamber with a minimum of labour. Sometimes the earth inside the 
chamber had been passed through a sieve : this shows that the second 
robber had found some gold beads left behind by the first ; he (the 
first one) would not need a sieve — he found the coffin and all the 
furniture lying clear. 

' We assume that thei-e was a coffin in all cases — indeed, fragments 
were often found, but complete coffins remained in four tombs only, 
and these four of the poorest. 

' They are short, with panelled sides and arched square-ended lid : 



216 EEPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 

two niches are made in the east side. In one coffin, the east side 
of which alone is here shown, the central panels are covered with 
a series of slabs; these are rounded at the ends and do not, as one 
would expect, butt against or mortise into the uprights ; this suggests 
that they are in imitation of a door.' [Similar coffins were subse- 
quently found by Professor Flinders Petrie in a contemporary cemetery 
on the opposite bank of the river.] 

' When the east side of the coffin is taken away the body appears, 
sharply contrasted, with head to the north and face east. The limbs 
ai'e swathed in linen bands, and masses of linen folded together lie 
above the body. There was some little evidence of an attempt at 
mummification, but no flesh remained on the bones; those of the 
arm lay free inside a wide cylinder of wrappings, which retained the 
shape of the limb. The preseiTation of these coffins and bodies was 
partial; some of the wood was quite sound, other pieces could not be 
moved. So of the cloth; some had been eaten by white ants, but 
some was in admirable presei'vation. 

' About fifty skeletons and parts of skeletons were found in fair 
condition, and these, happily, owing to the visit of Professor Elliot 
Smith, could be carefully examined, some of them before they had 
been touched. 

' In one only of all these four hundred tombs have paintings been 
found, but this is of very considerable interest, and the paintings are 
so extensive that our time for a whole season has been mainly 
occupied in copying them. This is the tomb of Hesy. 

' The panels of Hesy have been, for more than forty years, in 
the Museum; they were brought there by Mariette, who discovered 
them and attributed them, correctly, to the Third Dynasty.' 

These quotations from Mr. Quibell's report will make it clear 
that we are dealing with the remains of the very people who were 
responsible for technical inventions of far-reaching importance in the 
history, not merely of Egyptian craftsmanship, but of that of the 
whole world. This series of tombs reveals the stages in the acquisi- 
tion of the means of cutting out extensive rock tombs; and it is a 
matter of considerable significance to determine the jDrecise racial 
characteristics of the people who invented and were the first to practise 
these arts and crafts which were destined to exert so profound an 
influence on the world's culture. 

The crucial importance of the human remains buried in these 
tombs depends upon the fact that the earliest bodies hitherto found 
in Lower Egypt (exclusive of those brought to light at Turah in the 
winter of 1909-1910 by Professor Hermann Junker, and described by 
Dr. Derry, to which reference will be made later) belonged to a later 
period — Fourth to Sixth Dynasties — and revealed undoubted evidence 
of considerable alien admixture, such as does not occur, except in rare 
sporadic instances, in the earlier remains from Upper Egypt. The 
problem for solution was the determination of when and how this 
process of racial admixture began. 

The contemporai-y and earlier material found by Professor Junker 
upon the opposite (east) bank of the river, and a little further north, 



ON PHYSICAL CHABACTERS OF THK ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. 217 

was in a very bad state of preservation, and no adequate photographic 
record was obtained to permit of exact comparisons with other collec- 
tions. But Dr. Berry's report, which seems to suggest that the alien 
element in these poorer graves did not become certainly appreciable 
until the time of the Third Dynasty, served to add to the interest of 
Mr. Quibell's material, and to make it more than ever desirable to 
secure and preserve a collection of such crucial importance for the 
investigation of the problems of Egypt's anthropological history. 

The chief difficulty that faced me was how satisfactorily to deal 
with a collection of most fragile bones, a large proportion of which 
were certain to become damaged, more or less severely, during trans- 
port. As there was no anthropologist on the spot to measure and 
make descriptive notes on the material, it was proposed to employ 
experts to photograph each skull, and other important bones, before 
they were treated with size, or other strengthening agent, in prepara- 
tion for transport to England. 

But, while preparations were being made for carrying out this 
scheme, most of the difficulties were removed by the fact that the 
Egyptian Government requested me to go out to JEgypt in connection 
with the work of the Archfeological Survey of Nubia, and it thus 
became possible to visit Mr. Quibell's excavations in person, to 
examine and measure all the material on the spot, to supervise the 
work of photographing and packing it for transmission to England. 
It was possible to do so much in the short time at my disposal, 
because Mr. Quibell and his trained workmen afforded every^ help, 
and Mr. Cecil M. Firth and his native photographic assistant. 
Mahmmd Shaduf, of the Nubian Archaeological Survey, volunteered 
to help. Mr. Firth took about a hundred and thirty photographs of 
the material. Every help was also given by the Egyptian Survey 
Department in the loan of instruments and other apparatus. Further- 
more, the authorities at the Museum of the Eoyal College of Surgeons 
in London offered to take charge of and repair the material on its 
arrival, and to grant me every facility for its investigation. 

Full notes and photographs were obtained of all human material 
rescued by Mr. Quibell, consisting of the remains of thirty-nine 
individuals of the Second and Third Dynasties, most of which is now 
safely housed in the Eoyal College of Surgeons' Museum. At the 
outset it may be stated that the material closely resembles the human 
remains of the Pyramid Age found in neighbouring sites of a some- 
what later date. There are quite definite evidences of some racial 
influence alien to the Proto-Egyptian race ; but the difficult problem is 
raised as to how much of the contrast in the features of the two 
populations — Upper Egyptian and Lower Egyptian at the Second 
and Third Dynastic Periods — is due to admixture and blending; and 
how much, if any, is due to the specialisation in type of the Delta 
portion of the Proto-Egyptian people. 

The investigation also revealed some suggestion of attempts at 
mummification as early as the Second Dynasty — a fact of some 
interest, as the earliest undoubted case of mummification is refeiTed 
to the Fourth or Fifth Dynasty (more probably the latter), and no 



218 REPORTS ON THE STATE OP SCIENCE. — 1914. 

evidence has been obtained before of attempted mummification of a 
body which was not buried in the fully extended position. 

While in Egypt I took the opportunity of comparing the Saqqara 
skulls directly with the type collection of Predynastic skulls in the 
Anatomical Museum of the Cairo School of Medicine, and also with 
skulls of the Fourth and Fifth Dynasties at Dr. George Reisner's 
excavations (for Harvard University and Boston Museum) at the 
Giza Pyramids. 

For convenience of comparison I have followed the plan and used 
the notation explained in the Eeport on the Archeeological Survey of 
Nubia (]910), vol. ii., p. 40.

Human Remains. 

2102 F.' Man about forty-five j'^ears of age, with well-defined 
alien traits.* Buried in a small mastaba with degraded stair placed 
alongside a big mastaba. A very big, broad, full ovoid calvaria, with 
large bregmatic bone and squarish orbits, and narrow high-bridged 
nose. The rest of the face and mandible are missing (that is, were 
not saved by Mr. Quibell). L. (maximum length of cranium in milli- 
metres) 205, B (maximum breadth of cranium) 14G, F.B. (minimal 
frontal breadth) 98, H. 135, L.O. 38x34. 

2104 G. A man with a short and very perfect, well-filled ovoid 
skull, which does not conform to the Egyptian type; rounded orbits; 
long narrow nose; jaw of distinctly ahen type. L. 176, B. 139, H. 137

2104 J. A characteristic example of the type of skull (male) alien 
to Egypt, which was found at Giza and also at the Biga Cemetery at 
Nubia. It has large, obliquely placed, squarish orbits ; prominent 
narrow -bridged nose, with very projecting sharp margins and long 
nasal spine; a broad face with the zygomatic arches cui-ved strongly 
outward; a jaw with a wide chin; and a ramus which is narrow, 
moderately high, and has a big coronoid process. The skull is a 
short, broad, full ovoid ; there is a straight line of brow and nose ; 
very deep conceptaculoe cerebelli, associated with manifestation of 
an occipital vertebra. L. 174, B. 134, F.B. 93, H. 136, Biz. 130,

of length, 486. One molar is carious, and there is widespread but 
slight periostitis of the leg-bones and pelvis. The pelvis and leg- 
bones are very big and massive. 

2104 N.W. Woman, pi'obably about twenty-eight years of age. 
The skull is a broad, flat ovoid (or beloid), with markedly sloping 
forehead, the profile passing without break into the nose (' Greek

■* In using the term ' alien traits ' I refer to features which are foreign to 
the Proto-Egyptian people as well as to the Brown Race in general. In most 
cases — as for example this instance — these foreign features, such as ' a very big, 
broad, full ovoid calvaria,' 'squarish orbits,' and 'narrow high-bridged nose' 
are distinctive of the Armenoid population of Western Asia.

profile ') ; square orbits with rounded angles ; nose moderately broad 
and not very prominent, but the nasal spine is large. In most 
respects the mandible conforms to the Proto-Egyptian type, but the 
ramus shows a tendency towards the form distinctive of the Biga 
population (see ' Report of the Archfeological Survey of Nubia,' 1907- 
1908, vol. ii.). The teeth are perfectly healthy. The femur is small 
and slender, with slight flattening of the upper part of the shaft. The 
length of the right femur is 407, and the diameter of its head 38.

2104 H.E. This is a man about twenty or twenty-one yeai's of 
age, with a curious blending of the features seen in the skeletons of 
the man 2104 J. and the woman 2104 N.W., having the cranial 
features of the former and the facial traits of the latter. The skull 
is a moderately broad, well-filled ovoid, with a sloping forehead and 
a profile like 2104 N.W. The nose also resembles that of the latter, 
but is also curiously like that found in the Nubian people at the time 
of the Middle Kingdom. Its lower margins are rounded. The orbits 
are not quite so square as those of N.W., being almost elliptical and 
oblique. The teeth are perfectly healthy and unworn. The large 
size of the canines and incisors has produced slight prognathism. 
The left tibia is 306 in length; its epiphyses are just consolidating.

2162. An elderly man with the coronal, sagittal, and lambdoid 
sutures almost completely closed. The teeth are well worn, but 
healthy, excepting for a ' perforation abscess ' ^ at the root of the lower 
right first molar. There is, however, a considerable amount of tax'tar 
deposit on the teeth. The cranium is a big ovoid or beloid, with 
prominent superciliary ridges; small, flat, horizontal orbits; small, 
narrow, high-bridged, sharp-edged nose; a wide jaw, with broad chin, 
and a moderate ramus of alien form, with out-splayed angles. There 
is evidence of severe arthritis in the left temporo-mandibular joint. 
The face conforms to a type which is often seen in the Dynastic 
Egyptian. L. 193, B. 139, H. 136, F.B. 91, Big. 105, Sig. 52,

2116 N. This skeleton is probably a woman's. It conforms to 
the Proto-Egyptian type, the mandible being quite typical, and the 
skull a long ellipsoid, which is well filled. None of the cranial sutures 
show any sign of closing, although the teeth are moderately worn 
and encrusted with deposits of tartar. L. 181, B. 129, F.B. 93. 

2146. A middle-aged or elderly man, with a full ovoid or 
beloid skull, with flattened occiput, somewhat rounded orbits, and 
moderately prominent nose. The coronal, sagittal, and lambdoid 
sutures are closing, and the teeth are worn down, and there are

beginning to close. The teeth are well worn down, and there are 
four ' perforation abscesses,' that associated with the upper left second 
molar opening by a h^rge perforation into the maxillary antrum. The 
jaw is a big, heavily built ovoid, with well-marked muscular impres- 
sions and prominent superciliary ridges. The orbits are flat and 
horizontal, the nose is narrow with a prominent high-bridged root.

Egyptian pentagonoid skull. 

2172 B. This is a woman of twenty years, or perhaps a little 
more, with a small head of Proto-Egyptian type, and well filled 
pentagono-ovoid form; the nose has a small horizontal, elliptical,

This individual exhibits signs suggestive of some form of mummifi- 
cation having heen attempted. If so, it is the earliest authentic 
evidence of such a practice. The skeleton was found completely 
invested in a large series of bandages — more than sixteen layers still 
intact, and probably at least as many more destroyed — ten layers of 
fine bandage (warp seventeen and woof forty-eight threads to the 
centimetre), then six layers somewhat coarser cloth, and next to the 
body a series of badly corroded, very irregularly woven cloth, much 
coarser (warp six and woof fourteen per centimetre) than the inter- 
mediate and outer layers. Each leg was wrapped separately, and 
there was a large pad on the perineum. Tlie bandages were broad 
sheets of linen rather than the usual narrow bandages. The body was 
flexed, as was usual at this period. 

In the wide interval between the bandages and the bones there 
was a large mass of extremely corroded linen, whereas the int/ermediate

and superficial layers of cloth were quite well preserved and free from 
corrosion, except along a line where the cloth was corroded to repre- 
sent the rima pudendi — a fact of great interest when it is recalled 
that in the Fifth and probably the Fourth Dynasties it was the custom 
to fashion (in the case of male mummies) an artificial phallus. 

The corrosion is presumptive evidence that some material (probably 
crude natron) was applied to the surface of the body with a view to 
its preservation. If so, this is the earliest body with unequivocal 
evidence of an attempt artificially to preserve or prevent decomposition 
in the soft tissues.

The Significance of these Data. 

In discussing the facts thus set forth I cannot refrain from 
expressing regret that it was not possible to examine each skeleton 
in situ in the tomb. For in removing human remains from tombs, 
not only does the material suffer considerable damage, but a great 
deal of the most valuable kind of evidence is destroyed. In this 
particular instance the loss of this opportunity is particularly regx'etted, 
because I feel sure important facts bearing upon the early practice of 
mummification might have been recovered. 

In making these remarks I am not unmindful of the fact that 
Mr. Quibell removed the material from the tombs into his workroom 
with the object of facilitating my work and enabling me to do as 
much as possible in the limited time which I was able to spend upon 
this work at Saqqara. 

Apart from supplying what is perhaps the earliest evidence of 
attempts at mummification (see the account of No. 2262 above), this 
group of remains has also provided the earliest known instances of 
symmetrical thinning of the parietal bones not due to senile changes. 
That this parietal atrophy was not due to old age is quite certain, 
because the best-marked case occurred in the skull of a young woman 
(No. 2323 C) who could not have been much more than thirty years 
of age. This is interesting in view of the fact that such parietal 
thinning has not hitherto been known to occur at so early a period, 
although it became exceedingly common in the Pyramid Age, two 
Dynasties later. Its causation seems to be associated with the habit 
of constantly wearing heavy wigs, which by pressure affect the 
blood supply of the parietal bones." 

Another interesting feature of the material discussed in this report 
is the rarity of dental caries, which became so common and wrought 
such appalling havoc in the successors of these people of Memphis a

few years later during the Pyramid Age. Alveolar abscesses are 
common enough, but they are not, as a rule, the result of dental 
caries, ats I have explained above. 

The contrast presented by this collection of human remains to 
those of the Proto-Egyptian population of the Predynastic period is 
so profound, and the alien features so widely diffused amongst them, 
that a fundamental problem is raised for discussion. This question is 
so large that I propose specially to consider its bearings in a separate 
communication to the Association. 

The intimate blending of this Egyptian population with a people 
of foreign type and origin at so early a period as the Second and Third 
Dynasties points to the fact that we have to deal, not with a recent 
admixture, but one which must have been taking place for many 
generations before the time of the Second Dynasty. But we have no 
evidence to indicate whether the Western Asiatic element — for thei'e 
can be no doubt as to the nature of the alien strain — had been percolat- 
ing into the Delta gradually, or Came more suddenly in larger volume 
possibly as a people already mixed to some extent with Egyptian blood 
in Syria or elsewhere. 

The important result emerges from such considerations that the 
people who developed the wonderful and precocious civilisation of 
Egypt were not pure Proto-Egyptians. The gi'owth of early Egyptian 
civilisation no doubt represents the gradual evol-ution of the ideas and 
the arts and crafts which we know to have had their origin among the 
Predynastic people of Upper Egypt ; but their full fruition came only 
when the contact of peoples of diverse origin in Lower Egypt brought 
the influence of new ideas and new manners of thought^probably 
also a more vii'ile type of intellect — to stimulate and help in the 
development of the Egyptian civilisation. 

B. The Human Remains of the Hyksos Period found in the Southern 
Part of the Kerma Basin {Sudan). 

At the end of 19] 3 I received from Professor George A. Eeisner, 
who, working on behalf of Harvard University and the Boston 
Museum, had excavated a site at the south of the Kerma Basin, in 
the Dongola Province, a series of skeletons of the Hyksos Period. 
These bones were sent to me for examination, with the consent of the 
Archaeological Committee of the Sudan Government and the approval 
of the Governor-General, Sir Eeginald Wingate, whose interest in the 
anthropology of the Sudan is well known. 

As only a part of the material has yet been sent to me, and as 
Dr. Reisner has not yet communicated the details of the archaeological 
evidence, it would perhaps be preferable if I withhold my report until 
next year. 

I may say that the tombs of the wealthier people contained the 
remains of typical Egyptians, such as we know to have lived in the 
Thebaid during the times of the New Empire; while the other tombs 
contained skeletons of Proto-Egyptian and Middle Nubian (C group) 
types. Although slight negi'oid traits are common, there is a sur- 
prising absence of the more obtrusive negro features. 



ARTIFICIAL ISLANDS IN LOCHS OF HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND. 229 



Artificial Islands in the Lochs of the Hiyhlands of Scotland. — 
Fourth Report of the Committee, eonsistincj of Professor Bo\d 
Dawkins {Chairman), Mr. A. J. B. Wace (Secretary), and 
Professors T. H. Bryce, J. L. Myres, and W. Eidgeway. 

Since, owing to the meeting of the Association in Australia tliis year, 
reports have tO' he sent in at a much earher date than usual, the Com- 
mittee have so far little to record. The Eev. F. O. Blundell, the Com- 
mittee's correspondent at Fort Augustus, continues to collect and 
tabulate information. He desires to thank the Committee for their 
assistance and for their encouragement in his investigations of a subject 
which, though full of interest, presents many difficulties that can 
scarcely be realised by those who have not taken part in the work. 

By the courtesy of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, fifty 
reprints of the paper read befoi'e that Society, containing numerous 
illustrations, have been circulated amongst the correspondents of this 
Committee, and this has again stimulated interest in the subject. The 
Paper, which was compiled largely from the replies to the British 
Association inquiry, was printed in full in the ' Transactions ' of the 
Society, and elicited numerous letters of congratulation on the results 
obtained by the Association. Mr. Gilbert Goudie, F. S.A.Scot., writes 
amongst others : — ' May I be allowed to add that I have been much 
impressed by your paper on Artificial Islands in the " Proceedings of 
the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland ' ' ? These I had previously 
regarded as entirely exceptional and rare, but the numerous instances 
you adduce go far to show that they were almost the normal idea — ■ 
quite a new conception which will influence me largely in looking at 
these things in future.' 

One of the main objects of the Committee is to secure a suitable 
site for excavation. The artificial island in Loch Kinellan was pro- 
visionally fixed upon last year for excavation this year. Now Mr. F. C. 
Diack of Aberdeen has sent photographs and particulars of the ' Island * 
in the Loch of Leys, Banchory. The loch is now completely dry, and 
therefore this island is a much more suitable site for excavation than 
that in Loch Kinellan. The Secretary proposes to visit the site with 
the Eev. F. 0. Blundell in July, and hopes to receive the permission 
of the proprietor. Sir Thomas Burnett, Bart., of Crathes, for the pro- 
posed excavation. It is hoped that the funds at the disposal of the 
Committee, together with a grant made by the Carnegie Trust to Dr. 
R. Munro for the excavation of the island in Loch Kinellan, will be 
sufficient for a preliminary excavation. 

The Committee desires to be reappointed and that a grant of 51. 
should be applied for at the next meeting of the British Association. 

It will be necessary for a new Secretary to be appointed — Professor 
r. H. Bryce is suggested.

Exploration of the Palccolithic Site known as La Cotte de St. 
Brelade, Jersey, during IQli.—RejJort of the Committee, con- 
sisting of Dr. E. E. Marbtt {Chairman), Dr. A. Keith, Dr. 
C. Andrews, Dr. A. Dunlop, Mr. G. de Gruchy, Col. E. 
Gardner Warton (Secretary), appointed to excavate a Paleo- 
lithic Site in Jersey. 

Scheme of Operations. 

The Committee arranged with Mr. Ernest Daghorn, who had for the 
three previous years canied out the excavation of tliis site with signal 
success, that for the sum of 50Z. (being the full grant authorised by 
the British Association) he should supply throughout the months of 
March and April 1914, viz., for forty-eight working days, the services 
of three experienced quarrymen, while himself superintending their 
labours; that he should bear the responsibility for all accidents; 
and that he should fui-nish whatever tools or other appliances might 
be required for the work. The Committee has to thank Mr. Daghorn 
for having amply fulfilled all that was expected of him. The men 
worked with a will, and great intelligence was displayed in the 
execution of orders. 

Attention was exclusively directed to the main cave, already 
partially excavated by the Societe Jersiaise in 1911 and 1912. Mean- 
while it was hoped that it might be found to extend round the back 
of the ravine, up to now masked by talus, and so to be continuous 
with the smaller cave opposite, which Messrs. Marett and de Gruchy 
uncovered in 1913. Hitherto exploration of the main cave had been 
confined to the outer or western side, where the roof is somewhat 
lower^ and the pile of superincumbent debris consequently less. As 
the side contiguous with the back of the ravine is approached, the 
mass overlying the palaeolithic floor and reaching up to the roof passes 
from about twenty-five to some forty feet of thickness; so that for 
every square foot of floor to be cleared an amount of material weighing 
approximately a ton has to be removed. It was now decided to tackle 
this heavier part of the task and, as far as might be possible in the 
time, to carry the clearing right across the mouth of the cave to 
whatever might prove to be its inner or eastern limit. 

For the first three weeks the attack concentrated on the upper 
portions of the cave-filling, the extreme top being demolished by a 
successful piece of blasting which brought down some eighty tons. 
The ultimate aim being to open up the floor outwards from a line 
running parallel to the mouth about eighteen feet from it, it was 
necessary to cut back the higher portions of the detritus to the extent 
of another ten or twelve feet, so as to provide some sort of slope, and 
thus minimise the result of sudden downfalls. This was done without 
revealing either the true back of the cave or the supposed chimney 
through which the clay and rock-rubbish, other than what is due to 
roof-collapse, must have descended. It may be noted, however, that 
a tentative excavation on the further or northern side of the cliff into 



ON PALEOLITHIC EXPLORATION IN JERSEY. 231 

which the cave penetrates brought to hght a considerable fissure, 
about twenty feet higher than the level of what is to be seen of the 
cave-roof; and this may very well turn out to be the upper end of this 
hypothetical funnel. For the rest, these topmost parts of the cave- 
filling proved to be absolutely sterile, with the single curious exception 
that right at the back of the cave, some thirty-five feet above the floor, 
a piece of bone was noticed to jut out When this was with some 
difficulty rescued from its rather inaccessible position, it was found 
to have all the appearance of extreme antiquity, and is probably 
assignable to Bos. Presumably, therefore, it is contemporary with 
the cave-filling, and came down therewith from above. 

It was calculated that it would be just possible with two months' 
work to carry a clearing about eighteen feet broad right across the 
mouth of the cave to its eastern side-wall, since its upper and visible 
portion, distant about thirty feet from the opposite side-wall, showed 
a perpendicular drop which might be presumed to extend indefinitely 
downwards. On April 8, however, it was discovered that this wall, 
along the whole breadth of the eighteen feet in process of clearance, 
was undercut, at a point about sixteen feet above floor-level, by a 
further cavity. To judge by the narrow section opened up, there is 
not less than twelve feet of additional penetration to be reckoned with 
on this side. Shielded as it is by its lower roof, this annexe would 
appear to be at once remarkably dry and free from shattering falls of 
rock. Thus it offers conditions more favourable to the preservation 
of bone than the high-domed cave on which it borders, and would be 
an ideal place in which to come upon human remains. This discoveiy 
led to a modification of the original plan, the breadth of the clearing 
being reduced to about ten feet, so as, consistently with thorough 
exploration of the portion of floor uncovered, to stretch forth a 
' feeler ' in this tempting direction. Nothing short of a fresh bout 
of excavation, however, supported by a grant no less substantial than 
the last, will enable the Committee to cope with this unexpected 
lateral extension of the main cave ; not to speak of the rearward parts 
of the cf.vern which are likely to prove more or less prolific also. 

In proceeding towards the eastern wall it was at first impossible to 
note any stratification in the gradually thickening floor owing to the 
large blocks distributed through it. At about twenty feet, as measured 
from the western side, there was, for the first time, clear evidence of 
some sort of stratification. For three feet above floor level there was 
a bed of thick ashes of a deep black colour. Above for about one 
foot succeeded an almost completely sterile layer. Then, for another 
two feet, occuiTed frequent implements in a layer of brownish clay, 
interspersed with slight traces of a darker matter. It was at first 
thought that the implements of the lower layer were rougher, and 
that, in particular, the typical Mousterian ' point ' was absent. Sub- 
sequent observation, however, controlled by careful segregation of the 
finds from each layer, failed to bear out this view, some of the 
finest points (one of them, however, being worked on both sides, and 
in this way suggesting an older style of manufacture) being found in 
the lower bed. Of course a more detailed examination of the products 



232 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914, 

of the different layers may establish some sort of sequence in their 
forms. When the recess on the eastern side was reached the height 
of the implementiferous soil amounted to as much as twelve feet above 
the point taken to represent floor-level. At the very top of this bed 
were found three mammoth teeth and a large number of well-made 
implements. It is even possible to distinguish these highest portions 
as a third stratum, since in one place the top of the layer immediately 
above the sterile bed already mentioned was marked for about six feet 
by a thin line of almost pure sand. This sand was not such as might 
result from disintegration of the local rock, and its occurrence almost 
suggested that the inhabitants of the cave must at one time have 
indulged in the luxury of a sanded floor. This line of sand stood at 
al)out six feet above floor-level. 

Osteological Remains. 

At least 5,000 portions of bone, mostly very fragmentary, were 
discovered. It has been found possible only to submit thciSe to the 
roughest preliminary examination. Dr. Andrews reports as follows 
on tlie selection of bones submitted to him at tlie British Museum : — 

Hyceiia Crocula, var. Sprlrea. — Portions of premolar teeth. 

Canis Vulpes. — Maxilla. 

Cervus Megaceros (Irish Elk). ^Unworn upper molar, fragment 
of mandible with molars. 

Cervus Elaphiis (Eed Deer). — Portions of jaw, with teeth. 

Raugifer tarandus (Reindeer). — Numerous teeth, bones, and pieces 
of antler. 

? Capreolus Cciprea (Roe deer). — A tooth. 

(joat or Sheep. — A tooth. 

Bos primigenius. — Fragments of bones and teeth. 

Equiis. — Numerous teeth of a horse. The teeth are large, but it 
does not follow that the horse was. 

Elephas primigenius (Mammoth). — Portions of a thin plated tooth. 

Myodes lorquatus (Arctic lemming). — Numerous lower jaws and 
bones. 

A metatarsus of some species of Grouse. 

This brings up the list of species (exclusive of varieties as in the 
case of Equidcs and Bovidcs) from six to thirteen, Rhinoceros ticho- 
rhinus having been found on previous occasions, and yields what may 
be described as a thoroughly representative Pleistocene fauna of the 
cold, or tundra, type. 

Artefacts. 

The amount of worked flint unearthed in the course of the recent 
excavation proved simply immense, over 3 cwt. of implements and 
chips (including hammer stones) having been extracted. It must be 
remembered that flint is not found in situ in the Channel Islands, so 
that it is perfectly certain that all flint found in the cave has been 
brought there by man. It is impossible briefly to convey an impres- 
sion of the full extent of the material awaiting detailed study. This 
site will assuredly bear comparison with any other Mousterian site as 



ON PALAEOLITHIC EXPLORATION IN JERSEY. 233 

a source of a representative series of types. Very symmetrical ' points ' 
adorned with the finest secondary chipping occurred to the number of 
several dozen. The largest measured 130x88 mm. Curiously 
enough, a small piece broken from the side of this specimen was 
recovered at a spot distant several yards away, though at the same 
level, the patina proving that the fi'acture was ancient. Some of the 
' points ' were of the graceful elongated type that has been termed 
' hemi-Solutrian.' The most characteristic of these measured 
97x63 nnn. It is to be noted that the implement _ from the lowest 
layer worked on both sides was of this shape, measuring 115x52 mm. 
It is made of a piece of flint of a ' knotty ' kind which may well have 
invited additional trimming. Several cases of double patination occur, 
the most noticeable being that of a well- formed ' point ' measuring 
70x50 mm., which, having first been blocked out in true Mousterian 
style, has afterwards had time to acquire a white patina (very similar 
to that characteristic of the Neolithic in Jersey, and thus possibly 
standing for some 5,000 years), and has been subsequently subjected 
to elaborate re-chipping along the edges. A ' point ' beautifully 
worked in jasper, but, unfortunately, broken at the base, is something 
of a curiosity. For the rest, every known type of scraper abounds. 
Special notice may be taken of a frequent type in which the core has 
been utilised as a handle. A certain number of small pieces, the best 
examples measuring 50x22, 35x22, and 30x20 mm., bear a strong 
resemblance to arrow-heads, the more so as they have notched bases; 
though to ascribe tlie bow to Mousterian times may be somewhat 
unorthodox. One specimen, again, is of that ' rostrocarinate ' type of 
which so much has lately been heard. Apart from the worked flint, 
there is a very interesting series of utilised pebbles, every variety of 
hammer stone being found. It seems to have been customary with 
the inhabitants of this cave to split pebbles, especially those formed 
of diabase, and to use the longitudinal sections as _ scrapers or 
polissoirs. By good fortune it was possible to re-constitute such a 
pebble out of three portions found in different parts of the lowest bed, 
at some distance from each other. Occasionally pieces of stone other 
than flint had been trimmed into the rough semblance of 'points,' 
the best example being of the hard sandstone (gres Armoricain) found 
in Alderney. A very interesting series has been provisionally con- 
structed of granite implements. These occurred in the heart of the 
bed of ashes, side by side with flint implements of similar form, under 
such conditions as almost certainly to exclude the possibility of their 
being accidental splinters from the roof. Certain bone fragments 
showed clearly the signs of having been cut with a flint knife, and it 
is possible that they will have to be ranked as implements, one of 
them, for instance^ whether by accident or design, making a very 
convenient spatula. It only remains to add that everything_that can 
possibly be of human workmanship, including all the inevitable 
dehitage d'atclier, has been carefully preserved and stored by the 
kindness of the Societe Jersiaise in a special room, where the student 
can work over the whole material at his leisure, with every chance of 
constructing a truly classical series.

AcTcnowledgments. 

The Chairman, Dr. E. E. Maretfc, directed operations from 
March 21 to April 22, inclusive, the Secretary, Colonel Warton, 
assuming responsibility for the rest of the time. Nine members of 
the Oxford University Anthropological Society, including Dr. F. C. S. 
Schiller and Mr. W. McDougall, F.E.S., took an active part in the 
work, while there were also many local helpers, most of them 
Hiembers of the Socis^t^ Jersiaise. Special thanks are due to Mrs. 
JBriard for the use of her car and for her personal assistance in the 
important matter of transport; to Mrs. Coltart and Miss Bayly for 
their help both in finding and in dealing with the finds ; to Mr. G. de 
Gruchy, the proprietor of the site, who helped in the actual work 
of excavation for about a fortnight; to Captain A. H. Coltart (Exeter 
College), who actively superintended the work during its final stages, 
and took a leading part in arranging the material at the Museum ; to 
Mr. B. de Chrustchoff (Lincoln College), who for a month inhabited 
a small cabin upon the site itself, and acted as custodian of the 
treasure; to Mr. T. B. Kiitredge (Exeter College), who was constantly 
at work for a month, and afforded great assistance in every way; 
to Mr. Emile Guiton, of the Societe Jersiaise, who acted as photo- 
grapher-in-chief; to Mr. Joseph Sinel, curator of the Museum of the 
Society Jersiaise, who took efficient steps to secure the preservation of 
the osteological remains ; and last, but not least, to Dr. Smith Wood- 
ward and Dr. Andrews, of the British Museum, for the determination 
of the fauna represented by these remains. 

Future Policy. 

The Committee wishes to apply to the British Aissociation for a 
grant of not less than the sum previously given, in order that the 
work may be continued without delay. It is well-nigh a certainty 
that a rich store of remains awaits excavation, and, indeed, that it lies 
exceedingly near to hand, more especially along the eastern side, 
where the hearth deposits are particularly rich. Any such grant will 
be devoted entirely to the work of removing the debris. All incidental 
expenses will be met by local contributions, as in the present case. 



The Production of Certified Copies of Hausa Manuscripts. — 
Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr. E. S. Hartland 
(Chairman), Pnofessor J. L. Myres (Secretary), Mr. W. 
Crooke, and Major A. J. N. Tremearne. 

The sum of 20L, placed at the disposal of the Committee in 1912, 
has been expended in payment of the printer. 

Copies have been presented as follows : To the Committee for 
Anthropology, Oxford; the Syndicate for Anthropology, Cambridge; 
the Imperial Institute; the London School of Economics; I'Ecole 
d'Anthropologie, Paris; the University Library, Berlin; the India 
Office Library; Exeter College, Oxford; Christ's College, Cambridge; 
King's College, London; and to various missionary and other religious

societies where texts in Hausa will be accessible and useful to students. 
The usual copies have also been deposited in pursuance of the Copy- 
right Acts. There remain three copies in hand which the Committee 
hope to distribute in a similar way shortly. 



The Prehistoric Civilisation of the Western Mediterranean.— 
Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor W. Eidge- 
WAY (Chairman), Dr. T. Ashby (Secretary), Dr. W. L. H. 
Duckworth, Mr. D. Gr. Hogarth, Sir A. J. Evans, and 
Professor J. L. Myres, appointed to report on the present 
state of knowledge of the Prehistoric Civilisation of the 
Western Mediterranean tvith a view to future research. 
(Drawn up hy the Secretary.) 

Our knowledge on this subject has made considerable progress in 
recent years, though one of the main hypotheses — that of the advance 
of the so-called ' Mediterranean ' race (to which several scholars 
attribute the megalithic civilisation of the end of the Neolithic and 
the dawn of the Bi'onze Age) from North Africa — has yet to be tested 
by further research in Tripolitania and Cyrenaica, which we may hope 
that ItaUan archaeologists will shortly be able to undertake. In the 
meantime, the megalithic remains of Malta have been studied to 
some extent by the British School at Eome, though more work might 
be profitably undertaken there; a considerable number of dolmens are 
now known in Sardinia ; and a new group of them has recently been 
found in the neighbourhood of Bari, in the south-east of Italy. 

It would be important to study the intermediate links in the chain, 
which seems to connect the megalithic civilisation of the Western 
Mediterranean with that of our own islands : and the dolmens of 
Spain and Portugal might with some profit be further examined. 



The Teaching of Anthropology . — Report of the Committee, con- 
sisting of Sir Richard Temple (Chairman) , Dr. A. C. Haddon 
(Secretary), Sir E. F. IM Thurn, Mr. W. Crooke, Dr. C. G. 
Seligmann, Professor G. Elliot Smith, Dr. R. R. Marett, 
Professor P. E. Newberry, Dr. G. A. Auden, Profes'sors T. H. 
Bryce, p. Thompson, R. W. Eeid, H. J. Flbuke, and J. L. 
Myres, afid Sir B. C. A. Windlb, a2)i)ointed to investigate 
the above subject. 

The President of Section H, Sir Richard Temple, initiated a discus- 
sion at the Birmingham Meeting on the practical application of 
anthropological teaching in Universities. A report of this discussion 
was printed in Man, 1913, No. 102, giving the President's opening 
statement, extracts from letters from distinguished administrators and 
ethnologists, and an abstract of the speeches made by Sir Everard im

Thurii, Ml-. W. Crooke, Lieut. -Colonel Guidon, Dr. Haddon, Dr. 
Marett, and Professor P. Thompson. 

A Committee was appointed by the British Association lor the 
purpose of devising practical mea'sures for the organisation of anthro- 
pological teaching at the Universities in the British Islands. With 
this committee was associated a committee appointed by the Council 
of the Royal Anthropological Institute. These committees met in 
joint session at tlie Institute, under the chairmanship of Sir Richard 
Temple, and passed the following resolutions : ' (a) It is necessary to 
organise the systematic teaching of Anthropology to persons either 
about to proceed to, or actually working in, those parts of the British 
Empire which contain populations alien to the British people, {h) The 
organisation can best be dealt with by the collaboration of the Royal 
Anthropological Institute, the British Association, and the Universi- 
ties, with the support and co-operation of the Government, the Foreign 
Office, the India Office, the Colonial Office, and the Civil Service 
Commissioners, (c) It would be well for the organisation to take the 
form of encouraging the existing Schools of Anthropology at the 
Universities and the formation of such schools where none exist. 
(d) As laboratories, a library, and a museum, readily available for 
teaching students, are indispensable adjuncts to each school, it is 
desirable to encourage their formation where they are not already in 
existence. ' 

By the courtesy of the Master and Wardens of the Worshipful 
Company of Drapers of the City of London, a conference to consider 
the findings and recommendations of the Joint Committee was held in 
the Hall of that Company on February 19, 1914. The President of 
the Conference was the Right Hon. the Earl of Selborne. A large 
number of representatives of various Home and Colonial Government 
Departments, Universities, Societies, as well as politicians, adminis- 
trators, and others, were present or sent letters of regret at their 
inability to be present at the Conference, and expressing their sym- 
pathy with the purpose of the Conference. A full report of this 
Conference will be found in Man, 1914, No. 35. 

In November 1913 Sir Richard Temple addressed the Indian 
Civil Service students at Exeter College, Oxford. In February 1914 
he published a pamphlet entitled 'Anthropology a Practical Science,' 
which included his Birmingham Address (1913), an Address delivered 
in Camibridge in 1904, and extracts from that given at Oxford (1913). 
In March he addressed the American Luncheon Club, and also the 
Sphinx Club, both mercantile institutions, on Anthropology in its 
' Ijusiness ' aspects. And he has engaged to do the same at the 
Merchants' Luncheon Club at Hull. 

It has not yet been possible to place the findings of the Conference 
before the Prime Minister, whose time has been, and is still, taken up 
with urgent matters of State. An endeavour to secure an audience 
with the Prime Minister will be made when an opportune moment 
arrives. 



ON THE DUCTLESS GLANDS, 237 



The Ductless Glands. — Report of the Committee, consisting of 
Professor Sir Edward Sch.afer (Chairman) , Professor Swale 
Vincent {Secretary), Professor A. B. Macallum, Dr. L. E. 
Shore, and Mrs. W. H. Thompson. {Drawn up bij the 
Secretary.) 

Mr. a. T. Cameron has cpntinued his investigations on the presence 
and function of iodine in different tissues. Examination of the thyroids 
of the elasmohranchs ScylUum canicula and Raid clavata gave positive 
results, th,ose for female ScylUum thyroids (1'16 per cent.) Being 
higher than any previously reported.^ Examination of the thyroids of 
the dog-fish Acanthias vulgaris, oi the frog, of the alligator, and of 
the pigeon gave positive results, the variations found being traceable 
to variations in diet. Comparison of the iodine content of thyroid and 
parathyroid tissue in the dog gave such marked differences as to 
warrant the assumption that the parathyroid is not concerned with the 
production of iodine compounds, and, therefore, as far as these are 
concerned, that there is a differentiation of function between the two 
glands.^ 

A wider investigation has shown, in comparison with data previously 
published by others, that iodine is an almost invariable constituent 
of all organisms, plant and animal, the amount depending on the diet 
and medmm of the organism. With higher development there is greater 
specificity of the tissue concerned in storing iodine, until in the 
vertebrates no tissue except thyroid contains appreciable quantities. 
Thymus especially has been examined in a large number of species, 
with negative results. All normal thyroids contain iodine, the amount 
varying with the diet, and between the limits O'Ol and 11 per cent, 
(dry tissue). Other observers have shown previously that sponges and 
corals (besides many algte) contain quantities of iodine comparable with 
that_ in the thyroid. Three other types of tissue have been found in 
marine organisms which contain amounts of iodine over 01 per cent, 
(dry tissue) viz. : the horny tubes of Eunicid worms, the external 
cutaneous tissues of the ' foot ' of the horse-clam, and the test of a 
tunicate. Further work will be carried out to determine the type of 
iodine compound in these tissues, with a view to throwing further light 
upon the type of iodine compound in the thyroid. The above results 
are in course of publication. 

Mr. Cameron is also engaged in work on the effects of feeding iodine 
compounds (and thyroid) on the amount of iodine present in the thyroid 
gland, with a view to determine the rate of increase or diminution. 
These results are not yet ready for publication. 

The Secretary has been engaged upon various problems connected 
with the ductless glands. The effects of varying conditions upon the 
histological structure of the thyroid and parathyroid have been investi- 
gated in a preliminary fashion, but the results are conflicting and 
difficult to interpret. The variations in structure in normal thyroids

238 EEPORTS ON THE STATE OP SCIENCE. — 1914. 

are so great that the effects of feeding, drugs, &amp;c., cannot be sum- 
marised in a definite manner.^ 

The pharmacodynamics of different extracts have also been studied. 
Among other facts to which attention will be called in subsequent 
publications it may be mentioned that large doses of adrenin by no 
means always interfere with the normal action of the vagus, that the 
rise of blood-pressure due to injection of adrenin is of a double nature, 
and that comparatively small doses of the last-mentioned drug 
frequently cause an unexpected fatal result in dogs. 

The effects of adrenin and thyroid extracts upon the activity of the 
vagus have led to an inquiry as to the effect of hormones upon 
vaso-motor reflexes, and owing to the unsatisfactory accounts given 
in the majority of books as to the actual facts in connection with these 
reflexes, it has been necessary to extend the inquiry so as to include 
a consideration of the vaso-motor reflexes in general. So far, the only 
hormone which appears to give any interesting results is the extract of 
pituitary, the effect of injection of the extract being to change the nature 
of the reflex, so that in cases where, for example, stimulation of the 
cenlral end of the sciatic produces a fall of blood-pressure, afteir 
injection of pituitary extract a similar stimulation produces a rise. 

This work is nearly ready for publication. 

The Committee desire to be reappointed with a grant of 4:01. 



Galorimetric Observations on Man. — Report of the Committee, 
consisting of Professor J. S. Macdonald (Chairman), Dr. 
F. A. DuFFiELD (Secretary), and Dr. Keith Lucas, appointed 
to make Galorimetric Observations on Man in Health and in 
Febrile Conditions. (Draion up by the Secretary.) 

In furnishing a report upon the calorimetric work undertaken during 
the past year, it is necessary to refer to a paper published by Professor 
Macdonald and pi'inted in the 'Proceedings of the Royal Society,' 
B, vol. 87, 1913, and to a communication to the Physiological Society, 
May 1914. The commencement of the first paper, containing a de- 
scription of the apparatus and of the method of procedure followed 
in these experiments, may be omitted here, since these have been in- 
cluded in previous repoi'ts of this Committee. The latter part, which 
IS the collected and digested results of a very large number of experi- 
ments made upon a variety of individuals, forms a large part of this 
report. 

The experiments all through have been carried out by Professor 
Macdonald with the apparatus and in the manner already described 
by himself in the earlier reports. The subject, shut up within the 
calorimeter, was made to perform a definite measured amount of 
mechanical work upon the cycle. The degree of work was varied in 
different experiments, and from the data of these heat-production 

" See discussion, Lancet, 1914 (March and April), by Bell, McGarrison, 
Chalmers, Watson, and Vincent. 



ON CALORlMETRlC OBSERVATIONS ON MAN. 239 

figures have been obtained which fall into four groups corresponding 
to the grades of mechanical work done. It has been found that these 
results may be expressed by a constant multiplied by a function of 
the subject's weight, which varies with the amount of mechanical 
work performed in the different groups, i.e. '02, 'OS, '07 and "09 h.-p. 

Group A — Heat-production = K„W^'* 
„ B- „ =K,W^/^ 

„ C— „ =K,W« 

., D- » .=K, 

From these results it is evident that the weight becomes less and 
less of a handicap as the mechanical work increases. And, to carry 
this a stage further, the query arises as to the likelihood of the weight 
becoming a positive advantage at a still higher grade of mechanical 
vv'ork. 

The communication to the Physiological Society contains a formula 
for one of the subjects cycling at a revolution rate varying from 40 
to 98 revolutions per minute, and performing external work against a 
brake varying in different experiments from to 73 calories per hour — 

V gg.g 

43V '^1 + r^jTr^j-nX work in Kals. per hour = Kals. per hour. 

The first part of the formula represents the heat-production associated 
with the rate of movement 'V,' and is the same no matter what the 
value of the external work performed by the movement. The second 
is the ' coefficient of efficiency ' multiplied by the external work done, 
and fully represents the heat-production associated with the perform- 
ance of external work. It will be noticed that this coefficient of 
efficiency is represented as varying inversely with the two-thirds 
power of the subject's weight, and that the ' efficiency ' which is its 
reciprocal therefore varies directly with this value. This has been 
found universally the case in the data from all the remaining subjects, 
and explains the fact that in the heavier work experiments the results 
become independent of the subject's weight, if consideration is paid 
to the other fact, also elicited from these data, that the heat-production 
associated with movements per se (irrespective of the mechanical work 
performed by them) varies, on the other hand, directly with the function 
of the weight. In fact the total energy transformation is the sum 
of the two factors, one due to the subject's movements per se varying 
directly, the other due to performance of mechanical work in the 
course of these movements varying inversely as the subject's weight; 
but in neither case in a simple linear fashion. The general formula 
given (Proc. Physio. Soc, March 1914), is 

vw! 56.3 
87WV^™ + W's ^ '^°^^- 

The first fraction is probably expressible in the foUov/ing form— 

KJV 

KWV » ' where ' v' is the natural rate due to the ' pendular 
character ' of the limb movements, and V is the particular rate 
imposed in each experiment. 



240 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 191 4. 

Professor Macdonald also finds analogies between these results and 
those of walking experiments described by Douglas and Haldane in 
'Phil. Trans.' B, ciii., p. 245. A full consideration of the matter will 
be found in a paper communicated, June 1914, to the ' Proc. Eoy. 
See' on the ' Mechanical Efficiency of Man.' 

The section of the work dealing with the respiratory changes has 
also been continued during the past year. A number of experiments 
have been performed in which the respiratory interchange of a man, 
doing a measured amount of mechanical work upon a cycle in the 
calorimeter, has been investigated. The calorimeter is ventilated by 
means of a stream of air drawn through it at a uniform rate by a 
pump and measured by a meter placed on the distal side of the latter. 
All three are connected by tubing, through which the air flows, and 
the air as it leaves is sampled by suitable means every ten minutes. 
The samples thus obtained are examined by the gas-analysis apparatus 
devised by Dr. Haldane, and the carbon dioxide and oxygen percentage 
deteiTuined. The carbon dioxide figures, w"hen plotted against the time 
on squared paper, take the form of a cur\e rising steadily to a horizontal 
asymptote. 

In order to understand the figures thus obtained it was obviously 
necessary to inquire into the question of storage of gases within the 
calorimeter, and to do this a number of calibration experiments (17 in 
all) were made, in which a stream of carbon dioxide, measured by a 
gas-meter and generated by a modification of the apparatus described 
in a paper by Young and Caudwell (' Soc. Chem. Ind.,' March 1907), 
was passed into the calorimeter at a uniform rate, and the ten minutes' 
samples examined in the manner described in the experiments on the 
human subject. Attempts were then made to discover the relation 
which exists between the curve of the carbon dioxide in the leaving air 
and that of the carbon dioxide introduced from the generating appara- 
tus ; but so far the results appear so complicated that no definite relation 
has been arrived at. However, quite recently Mr. G. H. Livens, M.A., 
Lecturer on Mathematics to the University, has rendered most valuable 
assistance towards solving this problem. A fairly accurate empirical 
formula has been obtained from the actual readings, but it is not of 
such good agreement with the theoretical formula as is desired, and 
further experiments are being made to detect the cause of the dis- 
crepancy. 

Ownig to the appearance of a considerable error in the readings of 
the large meter used for measuring the volume of the air-flow through 
the calorimeter, it became necessary to replace it by a water-meter 
supplied by Messrs. Parkinson and Cowan, Ltd. Also, a large number 
of tests were made, both in the Physiological Laboratory and through 
the courtesy of the Sheffield Gas Company at their test-room, on the 
small meter which is used for measuring the volume of carbon dioxide 
introduced into the calorimeter in the calibration experiments men-

on these accounts is well under 2 per cent. 



ON iSFFECT OF LOW TEMPERATURE ON COLD-BLOODED ANIMALS. '24.i 

The Effect of Low Temperature on Cold-blooded Animals. — 
Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Swale 
Vincent (Chairman) and Mr. A. T. Cameron (Secretary). 
(Drawn up by the Secretary.) 

Mr. a. T. Cameron has continued the experiments of Cameron and 
Brownlee on frogs communicated in the last report, and has arrived at 
the following conclusions: — 

(1) The death-temperature of R. pipiciis from cold is - l"ib° ± 
015° C. 

(2) There is no climatic adaptation, nor any periodic adaptation due 
to hibernation, in R. pipiens. 

(3) The cause of death is a specific temperature effect on the co- 
ordinating centres in the central nervous system. Those controlling 
lung-respiration may be specially concerned. 

(4) Frogs survivmg degrees of cold such as those occurring during a 
Manitoban winter do so below the surface, near the margin of springs, 
and are themselves never subject to temperatures below the freezing- 
point of water. 

(5) There seems to be a slight variation in the death-temperature 
from cold, of different species of frogs, amounting to some tenths 
of a degree Centigrade. 

(6) Frogs heated rapidly to normal room-temperature from a tem- 
perature just below the freezing-point of their body-fluids (and not itself 
capable of causing death) are thrown into a peculiar hypersensitive 
condition, in which cessation of lung-breathing takes place for long 
periods. 

These results are deduced from experiments with R. pipiens from 
Manitoba, Minnesota, and Illinois, with R. clamitans from Minnesota, 
and with R. sphenocephala from C. Carolina. The experimental details 
will be published elsewhere. The Committee do not wish to be re- 
appointed. 



Miners' Nystagmus.— Interim Report of the Committee, con- 
sisting of Professor J. H. Muirhead (Chairman) , Dr. T. G. 
Maitland (Secretary), Dr. J. Jameson Evans, a)id Dr. 
C. S. Myers, appointed to investigate the Physiological and 
Psychological Factors in the Production of Miners' 
Nystagmus. 

Factors concerned: (a) Internal; central and peripheral, (b) External. 

Two features have long been admitted to be provoking agencies in the 
production of miners' nystagmus — an external factor, defective lighting, 
and an internal or peripheral factor, viz., muscular strain. The former, 
defective lighting, is found to be the more important, and our examina- 
tion led us to conclude that where this factor is in greatest evidence 
there we find the greatest incidence of cases. Miners' nystagmus is 
a disease limited practically to coal-mining, and, further, it is associated 
with the use of lamps of small illuminating power, such as the Davy 
1914. B 



212 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 

or its modifications, so that it is rare, even in coal-mines, to find 
cases of nystagmus where more powerful illuminants such as candles 
and electric lamps are used. Moreover, the great absorption of light by 
the coal-surface diminishes the illuminating value of the lamp employed. 
This absence of reflections from walls, floor, and ceiUngs interferes 
with clear visualisation, since direct rays are never so satisfactory as 
diffuse rays. The other factor mentioned above — muscular strain, 
especially of the elevators of the eyeballs — is also taken into considera- 
tion, notwithstanding the difference of opinion on the importance of 
this. Snell has collected several cases of nystagmus which, as in the 
case of compositors, has followed strain in this way, and we have 
ourselves found that there is a larger number of cases of miners' 
nystagmus associated with ' hohng ' than in any other occupa- 
tion underground — under conditions, therefore, which demand an 
awkward posture with straining of the head and eyes. Other sources 
of peripheral irritation are opacities of the media, errors of refraction, 
pigmentary and other ocular defects, which tend to produce or aggi-avate 
nystagmus by either modifying illumination or by causing muscular 
strain or by interfering with the direct rays on the fovea. 

Taking all these factors, however, into consideration — factors which 
are generally acknowledged — the fact remains that, working under 
similar conditions of illumination and strain, a large percentage of 
miners do not develop nystagmus, and it is our object to find out what 
is the decisive factor. Admitting the external factors in those who 
develop nystagmus to be more or less constant, admitting the occa- 
sional possibility of peripheral factors such as those above mentioned, 
there remains some factor unaccounted for which explains the selection 
of certain miners for this trouble. At this stage of our inquiry, how- 
ever, we investigated what seemed to us a neglected field — the relative 
sensibility of the retina in the foveal and in the perifoveal regions — 
and for this reason. The peculiar modifications which the dark-adapted 
eye undergoes might bring about a still further interference with the 
illumination by a reactive function on the part of the percipient. 

A consideration of the conditions of work in the coal-mine sug- 
gested very strongly the importance of the possession by the miners 
of delicate vision sensibility. Before dark- adaptation could be fully 
developed the miner at his first entry into the pit would have to 
strain his vision under the most trying circumstances to avoid roof 
obstacles as he made his way to his work. Such a strain would display 
itself in the muscles chiefly involved, such as the elevators of the 
eyelids and of the eyes. It is interesting clinically to find the initial 
symptom complained of is a heaviness of the lids. 

At work on the coal-face the miner with his eyes on the coal- 
surface would be subjected only to a few reflected rays from smooth 
facets of coal and some little diffused light from the coal-surface 
generally. Very dim light would bring out the latent differences in 
the visual sense, such as the differences of acuity between foveal and 
perifoveal vision. If the rays were too feeble to excite foveal sensation 
they might yet stimulate perifoveal sensation. 

Our theory regarding this particular feature of the eye was that a 



ON miners' nystagmus. 243 

perifoveal sensation, in the absence of foveal sensation, oi' a perifoveal 
sensation of greater intensity than a foveal sensation, would excite 
a fixational or movement reflex. This would bring the exciting point 
in the marginal field on to the fovea, and would then either cease 
altogether to excite sensation or would be so diminished in intensity 
as to lay the eye open again to marginal stimulation. With a central 
stigma, a neurasthenic diathesis, there would be present all the material 
for the development of a habit spasm. 

A large number of observations were made on students, assistants, 
and ourselves with a piece of apparatus described in the appendix. 
This apparatus was arranged to present a spot of light the intensity of 
which was controllable. The open eye was directed on this spot while 
the room was in full daylight, and then the room was suddenly plunged 
into darkness. At the end of five seconds the subject was examined as 
to his ability with direct vision to perceive this faintly illuminated spot, 
its intensity rapidly altered until the subject was only just able to per- 
ceive it. The time for this, the minimum visibile, usually took about 
five seconds, and the degree of illumination was remarkably constant in 
all these cases, so much so that we were able to fix on this degree of 
light intensity as our zero. The direct vision was contrasted with 
indirect vision, the subject being directed to look slightly away from the 
spot of light, which at once appeared to become more vivid. The inten- 
sity was then diminished until here again the spot was only just dis- 
cerned, and so we obtained a minimum vision visibile for indirect or 
perifoveal vision. 

At intervals of two and a half minutes the minimum visibile was 
estimated for both fovea and perifovea, and we were able to represent 
in graphic form the increasing sensibility of the retina to faint illumina- 
tion. In general the dark adaptability of fovea and perifovea increased 
rapidly up to the end of half an hour, less rapidly up to the end of two 
hours ; arriving then at its maximum sensibility it remained stationary. 
The perifovea throughout this development of dark adaptation not only 
retained its primary advantage, but slightly increased that advantage up 
to the limit of change. In our experience in the coal-mines we never, 
however, felt that the maximum amount of sensibility was ever in 
demand, and while the light was indeed feeble enough to be exces- 
sively irritating to our unaccustomed eyes, yet nowhere did we find 
working conchtions approaching our experimental conditions. Was the 
miner's eye differently equipped from our own, did it possess a greater 
adaptability through use and habit ? 

This led to an examination of the dark-adaptability of miners who 
had been afflicted with nystagmus, and here we found without exception 
a totally unexpected condition, yet one which now rendered plausible 
our fixational hypothesis. Instead of finding a greatly increased adapt- 
ability as a result of long use and cultivation of the eye in the dark, 
we found that in this respect it was greatly inferior to the ' normal ' eye. 
In the first place the 'zero ' was not perceived until after about five 
minutes of exposure to the dark, and then once perceived it remained 
without an appreciable development through the two hours' experiment. 
This peculiarity on the subjective side amounted to the same thing in

244 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 

its effects as a modification of the external factors of the illumination, 
so that the differences observed in the normal eye, under the experi- 
mental condition described above, might in the case of the miner come 
into operation under the condition of his work owing to the altered 
sensational values following retinal insensitiveness. The fact is that 
the theory of ' fixational reflexes ' might yet be true of the behaviour 
of the miner's eye in the coal-mine. 

The conclusion of the research so far then seemed more and more 
to lay stress on the one well-recognised agency, that of illumination, and 
that insensitiveness of the retina really amounted to the same thing 
as an absolute decrease in the illuminant. 

There remains for examination the actual excursion of the eye, and 
an examination into the nervous system of the afflicted miner. 

Since this was written an examination of unaffected miners has been 
made, with the result that there is no appreciable difference between 
their dark-adaptability and what we describe as the normal. 

The Apparatus for estimating the Minimum Light Sensibility in the Process of 

Dark-adaptation. 

It consists of an oblong box, the front of which is pierced by a round hole 
with a diameter of 20 mm., which is covered by an opal disc. At the back of the 
box exactly facing this aperture is a sheet of white paper which reflects light 
thrown upon it on to the disc. At the side of the box is another aperture into 
which a tube nearly 2 m. long fits. This tube carries within it a small 2-volt 
lamp which can be moved quite freely from end to end. The light from this 
lamp is thrown on a mirror so placed that it reflects this light on to the sheet of 
paper, which then reflects it on to the disc. It was only in this way the light 
could be sufficiently diminished to obtain marginal stimuli. 

After a number of experiments we arbitrarily decided upon our zero — that is, 
the light that could be only just perceived five seconds after the room was 
plunged in darkness. At intervals of two and a half minutes the subject was 
tested again, and the lamp was gradually moved away from the box until the 
subject failed to perceive the disc. 



The Investigation of the Jurassic Flora of Yorkshire. — Report 
of the Committee, consisting of Professor A. C. Seward 
{Chairman), Mr. H. Hamshaw Thomas (Secretary), Mr. 
Harold Wager, and Professor F. E. Weiss. 

This year attention has been concentrated on the plant beds on and 
near Roseberry Topping, North East Yorkshire, more especially on the 
Thinnfeldia beds. A careful search was made for the reproductive 
structures of Thinnfeldia, and this was rewarded by the discovery of 
numerous associated seed-like bodies, whose structure has yet to be 
investigated, and which may, perhaps, prove to belong to this 
plant. A new example of a Williavisoniella flower-bud was found, 
which is of interest in greatly extending the range of this form. Some 
fruits and seeds, probably referable to the provisional genus Caytonia, 
were also discovered, though they were previously known only from 
Gristhorpe. One or two new forms were found, and many duplicates 
of the more interesting species were collected. It is not proposed to 
continue field-work and collecting in the future on the same scale as 



ON INVESTIGATION OF THE JURASSIC FLORA OF YORKSHIRE. 245 

during the past three years until tlie existing collections have been 
fully investigated. 

The Committee does not seek re-appointment. 



The Vegetation of Ditcham Park, Hampshire. — Interim Report 
of the Committee, consisting of Mr. A. G. Tansley (Chair- 
man), Mr. E. S. Adamson (Secretary), Dr. C. E. Moss, and 
Professor E. H. Yapp, appointed for the Investigation thereof. 

Since the date of tlie last report a large number of experiments have 
been cai'ried out with evaporimeters. Especially, a large series of 
simultaneous readings have been taken, covering a considerable period, 
from instruments placed in various positions in beech-woods, coppices, 
and in open grassland. Several of the results suggest further lines of 
experimentation and research, but a much larger number of readings 
must be obtained before any generalisation can be enunciated. The 
evaporimeter readings have been run concurrently with a series of 
readings of wet and dry bulb thermometers, and also of maximum and 
minimum thermometers which have been placed in association with the 
evaporimeters. 

The work on soils has commenced, but so far has been mainly 
preliminary. Experiments have been made on soil temperatures, 
especially in relation to exposure, drainage, woodland canopy, &amp;c. 

The general preliminary mapping of the various associations com- 
posing the area has been completed, and an analysis of them has been 
made from the topographical and floristic standpoints as a basis for 
experimental woi'k in the coming season. In this connection special 
attention has been paid to the successive changes occurring after 
coppicing till the re-forming of the full canopy, and also to the question 
of the recolonisation by trees of cleared areas and grasslands. Data 
have been collected which serve as a starting-point for a more detailed 
study. 

The areas enclosed against rabbits, &amp;c., have also been under 
observation, and the changes occurring have been examined and 
recorded. 

The Committee asks to be reappointed, without a grant. 



Experimental Studies in the Physiology of Heredity. — Report of 
Committee, consisting of Professor F. F. Blackman (Chair- 
man), Mr. E. P. Gregory (Secretary), Professor W. 
Bateson, and Professor F. Keeblb. 

The grant of 30?. has been expended in part payment of the cost of 
experiments conducted by Miss E. E. Saunders, Mr. R. P. Gregory, 
and Miss A. Gairdner. Miss Saunders' experiments with stocks have 
had for their main objects : — 

(1) The investigation of the condition known as half-lioarincss anrl 



246 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE, 1914. 

its relations to the glabrous and fully-hoary forms. A new half-hoary 
race, which has been obtained after some difficulty, has made it possible 
to design a complete series of experiments, which is now in progress. 

(2) The further study of the gametic coupling already shown to exist 
between the factors for double-flowers and plastid-colour. This in- 
vestigation promises to give results of great intei'est, but a further 
generation must be raised before a statement can be made. 

(3) A result of some interest is tlie discovery that the double- 
flowered plants, at least in some strains, have a more rapid and vigorous 
growi^h than the singles. It is thus possible, by means of selection 
based on this difference, to obtain a far higher percentage of doubles in 
the flower-bed than would be expected from the normal output of 
doubles by a double-throwing single. 

(4) A beginning has also been made with the work of obtaining a 
complete series of types of known factorial constitution, so that a supply 
of material may be available for testing the view which has been put 
forward as to the inter-relations between the factors determining hoari- 
ness and sap-colour. 

Experiments with foxgloves have been designed for the investigation 
of a curious condition of partial hoariness, as well as for observations 
on the range of variability in the hepiandra form. 

Experiments by Mr. Gregory with Primula sinensis have been 
designed chiefly with a view to the investigation of the cytology and 
genetics of certain giant races, which have been shown to be in the 
tetraploid condition ; that is to say, they have 4.t (48) chromosomes in 
the somatic cells and 2x (24) chromosomes in the gametic cells, whereas 
in the diploid races the numbers are 2x (24) and x (12) respectively. 
These experiments have given results of very great interest, which may 
he briefly summarised by saying that the reduplication of the chromo- 
somes has been found to be accompanied by a reduplication of the 
series of factors. An account of this work has been published in the 
'Proc. Roy. Soc.,' B., Vol. 87, p. 484, 1914, and it is hoped that a 
further statement will be made at the meeting of the British Association 
in Australia. Further experiments with these tetraploid plants are 
designed especially to investigate the phenomena of coupling and repul- 
sion between certain factors. These experiments promise to yield 
results of very great interest, both as regards the genetics of tetraploid 
plants and as regards cytological theory as to the possible relations 
between factors and chromosomes. 

In the experiments with the ordinary diploid races, an interesting 
case has been discovered in which the coupling between the factors for 
magenta and green stigma is on the system 7:1; whereas in a very 
large number of other experiments the coupling (or repulsion) between 
these factors is of a very low order, apparently less than 3:1. 

A paper is in the course of preparation, and will shortly be 
published in the 'Journal of Genetics,' oai the inheritance of green, 
variegated, and yellow leaves in Primula. The variegated plants consist 
of a mosaic of two kinds of cells, respectively like those of the pure 
green and jiure yellow-leaved plants. The characters of the chloro- 
plasts, on which greenness and yellowness depend, have been found to 



ON EXPERIMENTAI. STUDIES IN THE PHYSIOLOGY OP HEREDITY. 247 

be inherited through the egg-cell only, the male gamete playing no part 
in determining the nature of the offspring in resper.t of these characters. 

The experiments of Mr. E. P. Gregory and Miss Gairdner on the 
inheritance of variegation and other characters in Tropceohmi have been 
continued. It is lioped that sufficient data will have been gained by 
the end of the present season to permit of the publication of an account 
of this work. Present I'esults indicate that in Tropceolum variegation 
is inherited in the usual way from both the father and the mother, and 
is a Mendelian recessive character. Other characters in Trofaolum 
which are being studied are those of colour and habit (dwarf or trailing). 

The experiments on the gynandrous variety of the Wallflower and 
its relation to the normal type are nearing completion, and it is hoped 
that an account of them will be published next year. 

The Committee ask for reappointment with a grant of 45L The 
expenses of these experiments involve an annual outlay of about 110?.. 
to 120?. By far the largest item in this expenditure is the cost of 
labour, which has increased during the last few years with the general 
rise in wages which has taken place. Other important items are those 
of the rent of the garden and the cost of heating the Primula house. 
During the present year Miss Saunders and Mr. Gregory jointly receive 
a grant from the Eoyal Society of 60?. in aid of the cost of this work. 



Breeding Experiments with CEnotheras.— Report of the Com- 
mittee, consisting of Professor W. Batbson (Chairman), Pro- 
fessor F. Keeblb {Secretary), and jNIr. K. P. Gregory, 
appointed to carry out the Experiments. 

The Committee have received the following Eeport from Dr. E. E. 
Gates on the experiments which he has made : — 

' The grant of 20?. made by the British Association for CE)iothera- 
breeding has been applied to the expenses of these experiments during 
the last year. In the season of 1913 about 10,000 plants were grown, 
representing a great many races and hybrids of QSnothera. The plants 
were grown at Eothamsted on a two-acre plot set apart for the purpose. 
They developed vei'y successfully, nearly every individual reaching 
maturity. The largest series of hybrids were the F3 from (E. grandi- 
flora, (E. rubricalyx and its reciprocal, and the F3 of crosses between 
CE. grandifiora and CE. Lamarckiana. The F3 generation of the former 
cross confirms and extends the results of the Fj and F, generations 
already published in ' Zeitschr. f. Abst. u. Vererb.,' vol. xi. They 
show in particular that both blending and alternative inheritance of 
characters occur. Some of the plants, which have been examined 
cytologically in conjunction with Miss Nesta Thomas, further emphasise 
the fact that mutation and hybridisation in OEiiothera are separate 
processes, both of which may go on together. Some of these results 
\vill be incorporated in a book now in preparation. '

The Renting of Gincliona Botanic Station in Jamaica.— Report 
of the Committee, consisting of Professor F. O. Bower 
(Chairman), Professor E. H. Yapp (Secretary), Professors K. 
BuLLER, F. W. Oliver, and F. E. Weiss. 

The Committee has met twice. The negotiations with the Jamaican 
Government are progressing favourably, the Committee having been 
assisted by the advice of Sir David Prain. There is every prospect of 
the house and buildings being let to the Committee on an annual tenancy 
to commence from October 1, 1914, at a rent of 251. There has, 
however, been considerable delay, partly owing to the long posts, partly 
to the progress of papers through official channels. 

As no agreement has yet been signed the grant of 25L has not 
been drawn. But in view of the prospect of negotiations being com- 
pleted on the terms above stated, the Committee ask that they may be 
reappointed, and that the grant of 25/. be carried over to the ensuing 
year as an unexpended balance. 



Mental and Physical Factors involved' in Education. — Report of

and F. C. Shrubs all, Mr. H. Bompas Smith, Professor C. 
Spearman, Mr. A. E. Twentyman, and Dr. F. Warner, 
appointed to inquire into and report upon tJie metliods and 
results of research into the Mental and Physical Factors 
involved in Education. 

The Committee has to report the retirement of its Chairman, Pro- 
fessor J. J. Findlay, and the election of Dr. C. S. Myers in his place. 
They have been engaged in collating the data which was pro- 
visionally reported upon at Birmingham, and hope to present the 
results in a definite form for the Manchester Meeting in 1915. The 
Committee asks to lie reappointed, and applies for a grant of 30/.. 
to include the unexpended balance from this year's grant.

vision whicli may result fi'om excess of speculiir reflection. The 
Committee is investigating the proportion of specular to diffusive 
reflection in the case of books and writing-papers used in schools, and 
has received valuable assistance from Mr. A. P. Trotter, who has 
devised a gloss-tester. The Committee desires to continue this investi- 
gation in the hope of arriving at an objective standard the adoption of 
which would prevent injury to eyesight through the use of glossy paper, 
and therefore asks to be reappointed with a grant of 61. in addition to 
the unexpended balance of last year's grant. 



Museums. — Report of tJie CotMnittee, eonsistiruj of Professor

Hill, Dr. W. E. Hoyle, Professors E. J. Garwood and 
P. Newberry, Sir Eichard Temple, Mr. H. H. Thomas, 
Professor F. E. Weiss, and Mrs. J. White, appointed to 
examine the Character, Worh, and Maintenance of Museums. 

The Committee report that a detailed schedule of inquiry upon 
Museums has been drawn up and presented to the House of Lords by 
Lord Sudeley. It is hoped that the schedule will be issued by the 
Board of Education, and that the information obtained will be available 
for the purposes of the Committee. Opinions and reports have been 
obtained upon various sections of museum work and their relation to 
various divisions of Education. Other inquiries of a similar nature 
are also being made. Offers of assistance have been received from the 
American Association of Museums. Two members of the Committee 
will examine overseas museums during their journey tO' and from 
Australia and report. 

A deputation will report upon the educational work of Museums 
in France. 

The following questions are receiving special consideration: — 

The requirements of (1) students; (2) school children; (.3) general 
visitors to museums. 

The Committee ask to be reappointed with a grant of ,30/., includ- 
ing the balance, 11. 9s. 2(/., of last year"s grant, now in hand. 



250 EEPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 



On Salts Coloured by CaUiode Rays. 
By Professor E. Goldstein. 

[Ordered, on behalf of the General Committee, to be printed in extenso.'] 

Perhaps a part of the phenomena which I am about to discuss is 
already familiar to you all. I shall not bring forward many hypo- 
theses. So you will perhaps ask why I should speak at all. And, 
in fact, apart from reference to certain facts not published hitherto, 
my int-ention is mainly to invite the interest of men younger and abler 
than myself in a class of phenomena which seem to constitute a new 
condition of matter, but on which very few have yet worked. 

If cathode rays fall on certain salts — for example, common salt, or 
chloride of potassium, or potassium bromide — vivid colours are pro- 
duced immediately on these salts. ^ Thus common salt becomes 
yellow-brown (like amber), potassium chloride turns into a beautiful 
violet, potassium bromide becomes a deep blue colour quite like copper 
sulphate. Here you see a specimen of common salt transformed in 
this way on the surface of the single crystals into a yellow-brown 
substance. I show also sodium fluoride, which takes a fine rosy 
colour. 

The colours so acquired in a very small fraction of a second may 
be preserved for a long time, even for many years, if the coloured 
substances are kept in the dark and at low temperatures. But in 
the daylight, and also under heat, the colours will gradually disappear 
till the original white condition is reached again. 

The colours of different salts are sensitive to heating in a very 
different degree. I could show you the yellow sodium chloride, pre- 
pared some months ago in Europe, but I cannot show you here the 
violet KCl and the blue KBr, because these colours, even in the dark, 
do not stand the heat of the Equator. The same salt, if dissolved, 
may kee() very different colours, according to the medium in which 
it has been dissolved, even when the pure medium itself cannot be 
coloured at all by cathode rays. I am speaking of solid solutions, 
produced by fusing a small quantity — for instance, of common salt 
or of certain other alkali salts — together with a great mass of a 
salt which remains itself colourless in the cathode rays, as, for example, 
the pure potassium sulphate. Lithium chloride acquires a bright 
yellow colour in the cathode rays ; but if dissolved in potassium sul- 
phate a lilac hue is produced, as you may see in this specimen. Like- 
wise the pure carbonate of potassium acquires a reddish tint, but 
after dissolving it in the potassium sulphate it becomes a vivid green 
in the cathode rays, as you see here. 

Very small admixtures are sufiicient to produce intense colours. 
So •5-5-0-OT5- of carbonate will produce the green colour in the potassium

sulpliate; even ^-^^i^^^ gives a marked colour, and an amount of 
certain admixtures, which I estimated as ruoooo only, may produce 
a slight but quite perceptible colouration in some salts. 80 if you 
work with potassium sulphate which you obtain from chemical fac- 
tories guaranteed as chemically pure, you may observe a set of 
different colours in these preparations under the cathode rays, by 
which you will detect the nature of the different small ad- 
mixtures which adhere to the pretended pure preparations of the 
different factories. In this way a new analytical proof, much more 
sensitive than the ordinary chemical methods, is obtained, and im- 
purities may be detected even when a certain specimen of salt contains 
more than a single impurity, because the colours produced by different 
admixtures generally disappear with different speed in the daylight or 
under rise of temperature. Eor instance, the ordinary potassium 
sulphate turns to a dark gray with a slight greenish tint at first. 
After a short while the very sensitive gray will disappear, simply under 
the ordinary temperature of the laboratory room, and a vivid green 
comes out. The gray hue indicates a very small amount of sodium 
chloride, lomroo O"^ so, and the remaining green indicates the admix- 
ture of a carbonate. Here are some preparations of potassium sul- 
phate each containing a single small admixture (KoCOg, Li.GOg, 
LiOl, KOI, KBr). You will notice how different are the colours of 
the originally white substance, varying from green to bluish gray, ash- 
gray, grayish blue, and violet. 

By fractional crystallisation one may finally get a really pure pre- 
paration of potassium sulphate, which is no longer coloured by 
cathode rays (or only in a very slight degree, indicating minimal traces 
of sodium chloride). But there are other preparations which, so far 
as I know, cannot be acquired in pure condition by any means, not 
even by fractional crystallisation. I never came across a pure sodium 
sulphate — the purity exists only on the manufacturers' labels. Even 
the best preparations of this salt contain an amount of sodium car- 
bonate which up to the present cannot be separated from it, not 
even by frequent fractional crystallisation. The colour produced by 
the small admixture, which always remains, is a very marked ash- 
gray. By an intentional further addition of sodium carbonate the 
colour becomes nearly black. 

The question aiises : What may be the cause of these colourations 
in pure salts and also in solid solutions of them? Shortly after the 
colours of the alkali salts had been discovered, an explanation was 
given^, according to which the phenomenon mainly consists in a 
chemical reduction. For instance, in the case of potassium chloride 
the chlorine would be set free, while the remaining potassium is dis- 
solved in the unaltered main quantity of the salt, colouring it at 
the same time. And it seemed a convincing proof for this theory 
when GieseP and also Kreutz, simply by heating rock salt in the 
vapours of sodium or of potassium, produced colours in this rock 
salt quite similar to those produced by cathode rays. It seemed that

252 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE.— 1914. 

the problem was settled finally. However, it was soon discovered 
that the coloured Giesel salts, although they look to the eye quite 
like the cathode-ray salts, in all other respects behave quite differently. 
For instance : — 

(1) The cathode-ray salts, as I mentipned before, are very sensitive 
to daylight : after an exposure to diffuse dayliglit of a few minutes — or 
in some salts even of several seconds only — the colouration diminishes, 
whilst the Giesel salts remain unaltered even when they are kept in full 
sunshine for days or even weeks. 

(2) The cathode-ray salts, if dissolved in distilled water, show 
absolute neutral reaction ; the Giesel salts are strongly alkaline. 

(3) The cathode-ray salts give vei'y marked photoelectric effects (as 
Elster and Geitel * observed) ; the Giesel salts are quite ineffective. 

(4) Under certain cii'cumstances, which will be mentioned further 
on, the cathode-ray salts may emit a phosphorescent light, the Giesel 
salts none at all. Therefore the question arose again, whether there 
is not a marked internal difference between the cathode-ray salts and 
the Giesel salts, and what is the nature of the latter? 

I have succeeded in settling this question, having produced salts 
by cathode rays, the behaviour of which is in every respect absolutely 
identical with the Giesel salts. You may produce such substances if 
you allow the cathode rays to fall on the original salts not for a short 
moment only, but for a somewhat prolonged time, until the salts are 
strongly heated. Produced in this way the salts will keep colours; but 
the substances coloured in this way are not sensitive to light; they 
show no photoelectric effect; they give strong alkaline reaction, and 
they are not suited for phosphorescence — all like the Giesel salts. It 
is quite sui'e, and you may test it also directly by spectroscopic proof, 
that in this case, if for instance you have worked on sodium chloride, 
the cJilorine is set free. Then of course an amount of free sodium is 
left, which dissolves itself in a deeper layer of unaltered sodium 
chloride, to which the cathode rays could not penetrate. I call these 
non-sensitive colours the after-colours of the second class, while the 
ordinary sensitive after-colours, produced in a short time on cool 
salts, are called after-colours of the first class. 

Now, if the after-colours of the second class are identical with 
the Giesel salts, then, of course, the very different substances of the 
first class cannot be also identical with the Giesel salts. Therefore the 
question arises anew what is the nature of the first-class after-colours ? 

One observes with regard to solid solutions that the first-class colours 
depend not only upon the metal contained in the small admixture, but 
they vary greatly, for instance, in the case of the admixture consisting 
of potassium chloride or bromide or iodide. This indicates that the 
metals alone do not cause the after-colours. It becomes much more 
clear when we expose some ammonium salts to the cathode rays. (The 
ammonium salts are cooled by liquid air in the discharge-tube to prevent 
their evaporation.) Then you get strongly marked after-colours hke- 
wise ; for instance, ammonium chloride becomes yellow-greenish, the 
bromide becomes yellow-brown, the iodide becomes brown, and the

ON SALTS COLOURED BY CATHODE RAYS. 253 

fluoride a deep blue. In the daylight these colours are gradually 
destroyed, quite like other after-colours of the first class. The colours 
themselves — yellow-greenish for the chloride, yellow-brown for the 
bromide, and so on — induce us to presume that the after-colours in this 
case are produced by the haloids, and not by the hypothetical 
ammonium radical. This presumption becomes a strong conviction 
when we observe that also a great number of organic preparations 
which contain no metal at all (and not any metal-like radical) acquire 
marked after-colours of the first class in the cathode rays also. (The 
part of the discharge-tube which contains the organic substances is 
cooled by liquid air.) 

Then you may observe that solid acetic acid (C^H^O,) remains 
quite colourless in the cathode rays ; but if you substitute a hydrogen 
atom by chlorine, the substance thus produced (the monochloro-acetic 
acid) acquires a marked yellow-green after-colour. If you introduce 
an atom of bromine instead of chlorine, you get 02H3Br02 and the 
after-colour is of a marked yellow. Bromoform (CHBr^) turns into 
the colour of loam, and chloral (CoHCljO) becomes a deep yellow. 
In this way we see that not only salts, but likewise substituted acids, 
substituted hydrocarbons, and substituted aldehydes acquire after- 
colours if they contain any haloid. 

Now, it seems highly improbable that in the case of alkali salts the 
electro-positive component is absorbed only (producing the after-colour), 
and that, on the other hand, in the ammonium salts and in the organic 
substances the electro-negative component is efficient only. The most 
probable inference is that in each case both components remain and 
that both are efficient, but that under the same conditions the haloids 
produce a slighter colour than the metals, so that in the case of the 
salts the haloid colour is overwhelmed by the metal colour. 

Therefore we are compelled to suppose that we have not to deal 
with a decomposition in the ordinary form, by which the different com- 
ponents are finally separated from each other and at least one of them 
is set entirely free, but that the components detained by absorption 
remain at a quite short distance from each other, so that they may 
easily meet again. I realise that — for instance, in the case of sodium 
chloride — at every point of the coloured layer there is an atom (or 
perhaps a molecule) of chlorine and an atom (or a molecule) of sodium ; 
but they cannot combine, because they are fixed by absorption and dis- 
tended from each other by the absorptive power, which in this case 
surpasses the chemical affinity. But the absorptive power may be 
weakened by heating and the chemical affinity or the amplitude of the 
molecular vibrations may be strengthened by the energy of daylight. 

If we grant these assumptions, it is immediately evident why the 
reaction of all dissolved colour substances of the first class is a 
neutral one, for the two components may combine again and re- 
establish the original substance. The other special qualities of the 
first-class colours, and especially tlieir differences from the Giesel 
salts, which contain the electropositive component only, may be de- 
duced likewise from this retention of both components and their oppor- 
tunity of meeting each other again when the absorptive power is 



254 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 

weakened or the chemical affinity is strengthened. Now, the two 
components in the coloured substances being distended in some degree, 
I propose for this special condition of matter the name of distension. If 
we accept this, have we created a new name only, or does ma^tter in 
this condition really show new qualities? It seems to me that we 
have to deal with a peculiar condition of matter, which deserves a 
more elaborate study than it has met till now. I will not enter again 
into some special qualities, which have already been mentioned — ^the 
photoelectric effect and so on — but I should like to point out that 
matter in the distension state shows a strongly strengthened absorption 
of light. 

We noticed with regard to ammonium chloride the yellow -greenish 
after-colour of the chlorine. Now, cathode rays, as used in these 
experiments, will not penetrate any deeper than one-hundredth of a 
millimetre into the salt. In such a thin layer even pure liquefied 
chlorine would not show any perceptible colour. But besides this it 
must be noticed that we observe this after-colour at the temperature 
of liquid air, and that chlorine at this temperature, as Dewar and 
Moissan observed, is snow-white, even in thick layers. In a similar 
degree the brown colour of bromine is weakened at low temperatures. 
Now, if nevertheless we observe at this very low temperature the marked 
characteristic colours of chlorine and bromine, we must conclude that 
the absorptive power of these substances has become a multiple of 
its ordinary value. One may observe this strengthening of the absorp- 
tive power directly in the pure sulphur. Sulphur likewise turns into 
a snow-white substance if cooled by liquid air. But when the cathode 
rays fall on the white sulphur it takes immediately a yellow -reddish 
colour. It is a real after-colour, because at constant low temperature 
the colour is destroyed by daylight. 

Now, since the strengthening of light-absorption occurs in this 
elementary substance, it becomes evident that the cause cannot be 
any chemical process, but only a physical allotropy. The special 
character of this allotropy (which may be connected with an absorp- 
tion of electrons) will not be entered on in a discussion here. Probably 
we have to deal with a polymerisation, so that, for instance, the 
yellow-reddish sulphur would be analogous to polymerised oxygen — to 
ozone. 

I have mentioned already that the first-class after-colours are 
gradually destroyed by incident daylight. A peculiar phenomenon is 
connected with this destruction of colour. I found that after the day- 
light had fallen on the coloured substances, even for the shortest timei' 
most of them showed a marked phosphorescence of long duration. 
I have observed this phosphorescence even in substances which had 
been coloured twelve years ago and had been kept in the dark since 
that time. The diffused dim light of a gloomy November day, when 
falling through a window on the coloured substance for one or two 
seconds only, is sufficient for the production of this phosphorescence 
in a marked degree. If you allow the daylight to fall several times 
on the same spot, then the colour is weakened at this spot, and we 
come to the presumption that the loss of colouration is generally 



ON SALTS COLOURED BY CATHODE RAYS. 255 

attended by the emission of phosphorescent hght. This is in accord- 
ance- with the experience of Wiedemann and Schmidt that if the 
destruction of the colour is produced by heating, Ukewise a phos- 
phorescent hght is produced, which in this case is strong but of a 
short duration, corresponding to the quick destruction of the after- 
colours by strong heating. 

If the salts, after having been coloured in the condition of a fine 
powder and then having been put between two glass plates (in order 
to obtain a plane surface), are placed in a photographic camera instead 
of the photographic plate, you may get a fine phosphorescent picture 
of a landscape or of architecture after a very short exposure. 

Time does not allow me to mention in detail several other 
peculiarities which are shown by matter in the distension state. In 
one direction only I may be allowed to make some remarks. 

The first-class after-colours may be produced not only by cathode 
rays but also by the /3 rays of radioactive substances, as you probably 
know. But they may also be produced by ultra-violet light, for 
instance, by ultra-violet spark light, even when a quartz plate is inter- 
posed between the spark and the salt. More than thirty years ago I 
brought forward a hypothesis, according to which in every point where 
cathode rays strike a solid body a thin layer of ultra-violet light- 
radiating molecules is produced in the gas, to which ultra-violet light of 
very short wave-lengths, for instance, the phosphorescence of the glass 
walls in the cathode rays, is due. But I came further to the assumption 
that nearly all effects which are commonly ascribed to special qualities 
of the cathode rays, and likewise of /3 rays and x rays, are mere effects 
of the ultra-violet light which is produced by the stopping of these rays. 
I have been guided by this assumption during many years, and have 
very often been aided by it in foreseeing new phenomena. For 
instance, in this way I was induced to expect that the after-colours 
would be produced not only by cathode rays but also by the ordinary 
ultra-violet light ; further I could guess that also the x rays would 
produce after-colours (which in this case have been observed by 
Holzknecht), and in recent times I could foresee that solid aromatic 
substances (the benzene derivatives) in the ultra-violet light must change 
their spectra of ordinary phosphorescence, composed of broad bands, 
and turn to peculiar spectra composed of narrow stripes, the wave- 
lengths of which are characteristic of the single aromatic substances. ° 
So I believe also that the after-colours are produced not directly by the 
cathode rays or by /3 rays, but by the aforesaid ultra-violet light which 
is connected with the stopping of the other rays. 

In this way the after-colours enter at once into a great class of 
phenomena known as reversible effects of light. You know that certain 
effects of the visible spectral rays are destroyed by rays of longer 
wave-lengths, by the infra-red rays. And the analogy to this 
phenomenon is in my opinion the destruction of the after-colours : they 
are produced by the ultra-violet light of the stopped cathode rays and 
are annihilated by the longer visible wave-lengths of daylight. In this 
way you may likewise understand, for instance, that the coloured

256 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. ^19 14. 

spots, produced by x rays on the luminescent screens after long 
exposure, may be destroyed again by exposure of the screens to day- 
light. You may also explain the peculiar medical observation that 
therapeutic radium effects in parts of the human body not covered, 
specially in the face, are often not of long duration — for the face is 
exposed to the counteracting visible rays of daylight. 

We notice here a connection of our subject with a department of 
great practical importance. For all therapeutic effects of x rays, 
radium rays, and mesothorium rays would, according to this view, be 
effects only of ultra-violet light produced by the stopping of these rays 
in the human body, and the special character of the radium- and meso- 
thorium- and d:-ray treatment would consist mainly in the carriage into 
the interior of the body, by the rays, of the ultra-violet light, which 
is not confined to the surface of the body, but is produced at every place 
where any of the entering rays are stopped. You may notice further 
that this view of the medical ray-effects presents a heuristic method 
for the treatment itself, which up to the present followed quite fortui- 
tous and merely empirical paths. For it may be hoped that treatment 
by radioactive substances will be useful in eveiy disease in which ultra- 
violet light has been proved to be efficient in some degree ; you will 
avoid such treatment in the well-known cases in which light of short 
wave-lengths is noxious, and you may be justified in substituting an 
ultra-violet light treatment where radium or mesothorium is not obtain- 
able. At the same time it becomes evident why the treatment of certain 
diseases by the j3 rays has effects very similar to those produced by 
fulgiiration — that is, by the light of very strong sparks: the efficient 
agent is in both cases the ultra-violet light. 

But it cannot be a physicist's task to enter too far in medical 
questions : it was only my intention to show how interesting are some 
of the problems which are connected with the salts coloured by cathode 
ravs. 



The Problem of the Visual Requirements of the Sailor and the 
Railway Employee. By James W. Barrett, C.M.G., M.D., 
M.S.,F.R.C.S.Eng. 

[Ordered, on behalf of the General Committee, to be printed in extenso.'] 

The discussions which have taken place on this subject are apparently 
interminable. They have for the most part resolved themselves into 
discussions amongst oculists and communications made by deputation 
or otherwise to the Board of Trade presenting their point of view. 

The Board of Trade, whilst it has collected a certain amount of 
valuable information, has not materially modified its methods, and 
apparently does not propose to do so. As its authority weighs heavily 
in the Dominions, which are as a rule not consulted by it before it takes 
action, various anomalies make their appearance. I venture therefore 
to bring before this meeting of the Physiological Section of the British 
Association a summary of the present position. 



VISUAL REQUIREMENTS OP SAILOR AND RAILWAY EMPLOYEE. 257 

Until recently the standard adopted by the Board of Trade was 
normal colour vision as tested by coloured wools and a form vision 
equal to 6/12 partly with both eyes open. In other words, the theo- 
retical objective was normal colour vision, and form vision of such a 
standard that one eye might be totally blind and the other possess 
somewhat less than half vision. The Board, however, appointed an 
expert committee in 1910, which took evidence and made a number of 
recommendations. This committee sat for two years, and in its report 
recommended that the form vision required should be 6/6 in one eye 
and 6/12 in the other, and that colour vision should be tested by wools 
and by coloured lanterns. It did not, however, definitely recommend 
that the eyes of those who enter dangerous services should be subjected 
to a complete ophthalmological examination when the boy first goes to 
sea. Apparently such changes would have required fresh legislation. 

Since this report, however, the Board of Trade has again altered 
its requirements, and now requires the candidate to read 6/9 partly and 
6/6 partly with both eyes open, which means, simply, that the old 
standard has been I'everted to as regards form vision, except that the 
minimum has been raised from 6/12 partly to 6/9 partly. During the 
course of its long inquiry the expert committee apparently did not 
consult those in the Dominions who were dealing with the matter, witli 
the exception of the examination of two witnesses, nor did they 
apparently seek to make any careful reference to the various accidents 
which have taken place by sea and land and can be attributed to 
defective vision. 

Clause 13 of the Eeport of the Departmental Committee on Sight 
Tests states: — 'Sir Walter Howell informed us that the Board of 
Trade were not awai-e of any casualty which could be traced to defective 
vision. He explained that the Board could raise any question they 
pleased on an official inquiry into a marine casualty ; that the smallest 
question as to the colour vision of any officer concerned would be probed 
to the bottom; that if there were any question of confusion the men 
concerned would be re-tested ; but that such a question had not been 
raised in a single instance. We have examined a large number of the 
Eeports of Board of Trade inquiries, and the result of our examinations 
has confirmed the view that no official evidence exists of casualties due 
to this cause. We have examined eight master mariners of long 
experience, none of whom knew of any case in which a casualty had 
arisen from defective vision.' 

Clause 14. — ' At our request the Liverpool Steamship Owners' 
Association ascertained that, of its members, the owners of 857 steam 
vessels, of the aggregate tonnage of 3,776,695 tons, knew of no instances 
in which mistakes due to defective form or colour vision had been made 
in the reading of lights at sea, and of no instance of difficulty of reading 
signals ; while the owners of 59 steam vessels of 192,494 tons knew of 
some few instances in which a man's sight had been or had been 
alleged to have been defective, but of no casualty resulting therefrom.' 

Clause 15. — ' The Secretary of the Joint Arbitration Committee at 
Grimsby, whicli investigates the circumstances of a large number of 
collisions CA-ery year, has never known of a collision caused through 
1914. S 



258 EEPORTS ON THE STATE OE SCIENCE. — 1914. 

the mistaking of the colour of a hght. The Manager of the Hull Steam 
Trawlers' Mutual Insurance and Protection Co., Ltd., who in 12 years 
has had to deal with an average of 100 coUisions a year, knows of 
only four cases in which any question of defective vision has arisen. 
Two of these cases were in elderly men, and in the other two the 
witness considered the danger was caused by excessive smoking. ' 

Clause 17. — ' The Board of Trade casualty returns, which include 
collisions to foreign ships on or near the coast of the United Kingdom 
and of British Possessions, show no case in which a sea casualty has 
been atti'ibuted to the defective vision either of an officer or a look-out 
man ; but they show that since the adoption of the 1894 sight tests 
there have been reported on the average each year 100 collisions 
attributed to bad look-out and 429 strandings attributed to causes con- 
nected with navigation and seamanship. The strandings resulting 
from bad look-out are not shown separately. From these returns it is 
not possible to ariive at any reliable estimate of the total number that 
might have been occasioned by the defective vision of the officer in 
charge or of the man on the look-out. Further, the returns, as they 
do not distinguish the vessels commanded by officers who have passed 
tiie 1894 sight test, afford only a general basis of determining how far 
the existing system has been successful in eliminating dangerously 
defective men ; but they do show that amongst the vessels registered in 
the United Kingdom the total number of collisions attributable to bad 
look-out and of strandings attributable to all causes relating to naviga- 
tion and seamanship is less than 500 a year. The Board of Trade has 
no record of the actual number of voyages made by British vessels, but 
on a rough estimate that number cannot be less than 300,000 a year.' 

Clause 18. — ' There appears to be no evidence showing conclusively 
that defective vision has caused any appreciable number of accidents at 
sea, although we do not think that it necessarily follows from this that 
the present method, even where it has been employed, has been success- 
ful in excluding all dangerous persons from the Mercantile Marine, or 
that no accidents have been caused in this way, since it has not been 
the practice, in conducting inquiries into the causes of casualties, to 
test the vision of persons implicated. We think it regrettable that 
effect has not been given to the recommendation as to the testing of 
witnesses contained in the report of the committee of the Eoyal Society 
in 1894, and we desire to repeat that recommendation — that in case 
of judicial inquiries as to collisions or accidents witnesses giving 
evidence as to the nature or position of coloured signals and lights 
should be themselves tested for colour and form vision.' 

Sir Norman Hill, who signed the Minority Eeport, states that ' in 
the absence of all evidence of any single casualty resulting from defec- 
tive form vision I am opposed to the retention of the new standard 
under which 10 per cent, of the candidates who have for many years 
proved their competency would have been excluded from the service.' 
Mr. Nettleship, however, one of the members, since the publication of 
the Eeport, made a collection of the cases in which disaster at sea or 
land seemed to be actually or potentially due to these causes, and was 
in communication with the writer in regard to the details of a number 



VISUAL REQUIREMENTS OF SAILOR AND RAILWAY EMPLOYEE. 250 

of Other cases at the time of his death. In that work Mr. Nettleship 
makes the following pertinent observation (p. 3) :—' For reasons 
such as the above, defects in sight are regarded by those who have to 
inquire into accidents as of such little importance that in the official 
investigations the question of defects of sight in the men who are 
on look-out or corresponding duty is scarcely ever raised. Naturally, 
therefore, no accidents are discovered to have had visual defects for 
their cause. Continuing to reason in a circle, the conclusion is that 
defects of sight do not cause accidents ! It would be ludicrous if the 
matter were not so grave that though precautions of greater or less 
efficacy are taken to exclude men with conspicuous defects of sight from 
entering the sea or railroad services because such defects are admittedly 
dangerous, yet, when the accident happens, no trouble is taken to find 
out whether the man responsible for it has efficient sight or not. Every 
possible cause for the casualty is sought out, but the possibility that his 
vision either was defective when he entered the service or has become 
so since is never even considered.' 

Yet in spite of the foregoing the fact remains that Dr. Orr and I 
reported in the Lancet, October 29, 1904, the account of the wreck of 
the Australia and the previous grounding of the Indraghiri by a pilot 
whose form vision was very defective. In spite of this Eeport, the 
statements of Sir Walter Howell and Sir Norman Hill appear in the 
Expert Committee's Eeport. I propose now to refer to the methods 
adopted in the Victorian Eailways, the Victorian Pilot Service, and the 
Union S.S. Co. of New Zealand. The history of vision-testing in the 
Victorian Eailways is too lengthy for detailed reference. The number 
of candidates who have to be dealt with is very large, and the Depart- 
ment has adopted a rough-and-ready plan with which I ani not in 
complete sympathy, but which undoubtedly eliminates the majority of 
the defective cases. Colour vision is tested by the lantern and form 
vision by Snellin's types. For those entering the service the vision 
required is 6/6 in each eye and 6/6 in both together. The pupil is then 
dilated with homatropine and the vision is again tested. It must now 
not be less than 6/12 in each eye or 6/12 in both together. Once the 
applicants are admitted to the service they are re-tested without the 
use of homatropine, and must possess 6/12 vision in each eye and 6/9 in 
both together. 

I propose now to indicate the steps that have been taken by the 
Marine Board of Victoria to provide for the thorough examination of 
the vision of pilots who enter their service, and for their re-examination 
since the disaster of 1904. I also quote Clauses 100, 102, 104 and 
105 of the regulations which provide for the contingencies to which 
Mr. Nettleship referred. 

Victoriav Pilot Firgulations. 

Pilots must be examined prior to admission io tlie service, and 
I heir vision must be as follows: — 

1 . Vision to be 6/6 in each eye without glasses. 

2. The total error of refraction not to exceed 1 d, and of this 

s 2 



260 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 

astigmatism not to exceed '5 d. This estimate to be made by 
retinoscopy with the eye under the influence of a mydriatic. 

3. Tlae pupillary reflex to be normal, the fundus to be free from 
disease, visual fields normal, and balance of colour muscles to be 
normal. Candidate to possess binocular vision. 

4. Colour vision to be normal as tested by coloured wools and 
coloured discs. 

If persons possessing these qualifications are admitted, on re- 
examination the standard required is : — 

1. The same as in the case of an applicant for a licence, except that 
after admission into the service deterioration of vision will be allowed, 
provided that the vision is not less than 6/9 fully and 6/6 partly in 
each eye. 

2. There must be no evidence of any morbid or other condition 
in either eye which would render it probable that the vision would 
deteriorate before the next periodical examination. 

Clause 100 provides that ' every pilot until he arrives at the full 
age of sixty years, whether licensed before or after the coming into 
force of tbese regulations, shall at intervals of not more than twelve 
calendar months, and in the case of a pilot who under the regulations 
does not necessarily retire at the age of sixty years, after he attains that 
age, at intervals of not more than six calendar months, have his 
eyes examined and vision tested, and pass as satisfying the prescribed 
standard by an expert oculist to be approved by the Marine Board.' 

Clause 102 provides: — ' If, on the occasion of any examination or 
testing of a pilot or of his eyesight or vision (whether biennial, sixth 
monthly, or casual) any ijhysical, mental, or visual defect is discovered 
wliich in the opinion of the medical examiner or expert oculist, as the 
case may be, does not immediately, but may within a variable time, 
render the pilot unfit for service, such pilot shall submit himself for 
re-examination within such lesser intea'vals than those hereinbefore pre- 
scribed as the examiner or oculist, as the case may be, may certify 
to be necessary, any longer interval hereinbefore limited to the contrary 
notwithstanding.' 

Clause 104 provides: — ' In the event of any casualty or accident 
occurring to or in connexion with any vessel or incidental to the naviga- 
tion thereof, which in tlie opinion of the Marine Board may be due to or 
of which in its opinion one of the contributing causes may have been 
some defect in health or vision of the pilot in charge, such pilot shall 
if required by the Board forthwith submit himself and be examined 
by a medical practitioner or expert oculist to be nominated by the 
Board, or by both, as the Board may direct, and until such practitioner 
or oculist or both, as the case may be, shall certify that such pilot is fit 
physically and mentally or visually, and such certificate be lodged with 
the Secretary to the Board, such pilot shall not follow his calhng.' 

Clause 105: — 'If any pilot be absent from duty on account of 
illness, and such absence shall extend beyond twenty-eight days, or in 
case of illness of any duration, if the Marine Board think it advisable, 
or when from any other cause any pilot has been absent from duty and 



VISUAL REQUIREMENTS OF SAILOR AND RAILWAY EMPLOYEE. 261 

such absence shall have extended for six calendar months or upwards, 
such pilot shall not return to duty unless and until, as regards his 
condition physical and mental, a medical practitioner and, as regards 
his vision and eyesight, an expert oculist, to be in both cases nominated 
by the Marine Board, have respectively certified to the Board that such 
pilot is in a fit condition physically, mentally, and visually to perlorni 
his duties as a pilot. ' 

The annual examination of the pilots has probably averted disaster, 
as one pilot was retired with high blood-pressure and retinal hemor- 
rhages detected in the course of periodical examination. 

The Union Steamship Company of New Zealand adopts a like 
standard for those who enter its service, and provides for periodical 
testing of form vision. 

what standard of form and colour vision is necessary for safe 
navigation or railway service? 

So far as colour vision is concerned the results of the ordinary tests 
with wools and lanterns seem to coincide with the quantitative measure- 
ments made by Sir William Abney, and I have never seen any prac- 
tical difficulty in detecting a dangerous degree of colour defect by the 
combination of these means. 

With regard to form vision, however, the matter is not nearly so 
simple. Two questions arise : What standard of form vision shall be 
required? and. Are two eyes necessary? Some time ago, in the 
Ophihalmic Review, Mr. Fergus gave an account of his own experi- 
ence in motor navigation with defective vision. Apart from theoretical 
disquisition which I was unable to follow, he stated correctly enough 
that lowered form vision means for the most part a loss of detail. A 
house is still seen as a house at a distance when the form vision 
is lowered, and a ship is still seen as a ship in like circumstances. I, 
however, set to work to make myself artificially myopic with bi-convex 
glasses, and to reduce my form vision to different degrees in order to 
repeat his experience. In passing, however, it should never be for- 
gotten that the standards given by Snellin's types are at best approxi- 
mate. They depend on the illumination of the types, on the contrast 
between the letters and the background, on the illumination of the 
room, a,nd the size of the pupil. They nearly always give better results 
in daylight than by artificial illumination. At best they have approxi- 
mate significance. 

Rendering my eyes artificially myopic in this way, I reduced my 
vision to 6/9 partly and 6/12, and found, as Mr. Fergus said, that 
houses, men, dogs, and objects of various kinds were still recognised 
as such, but certain details could not be detected. For example, a 
man and a dog at five hundred yards' distance were seen as one mass; 
a flag on a flagpole at a distance of a mile was indefinite, so that one 
could not tell which way the wind was blowing. Outside Dunedin 
Harbour I mistook a ship on the rocks for the rocks themselves. By 
bright ordinary daylight I should have experienced little or no difficulty 
in navigating. Furthermore, in a long motor run there was not the 
least difficulty in seeing details on the road, and there would ha^e been 
no difficulty in steering the motor. At evening, however, and at niglit, 



262 REPORTS ON THE STATE OP SCIENCE. — 1914. 

the matter was entirely different, and with this reduced vision motor 
driving would have been full of difficulty and danger by reason of the 
reduction of the range of vision. When, however, I lowered the vision 
to 6/18 partly navigation and motor driving would have been dangerous 
by night or day. 

The experimental evidence obtained by the Expert Committee at 
Shoeburyness was to the effect that vision of less than 6/12 seriously 
affects colour perception, and that consequently 6/12 represents the 
minimum of vision compatible with safety. This accords with my own 
personal experience, with the x'eservation that anyone who possesses 
6/6 vision will be a much safer navigator, other things being equal, 
than anyone who possesses 6/12 vision. 

Mr. Fergus seems to draw a distinction between myopia and hyper- 
opia, but when I have rendered my vision defective by rendering my 
eyes hyperopic — that is, by the wearing of concave spectacles — I have 
been unable to detect any practical difference in the result. In both 
cases one makes many failures when one's colour vision is tested by 
the lantern. When the aperture is small and the light a little dim, 
no colour can be seen at all, probably for the reason that Sir William 
Abney instances. 

In Sir William Abney 's work, dated 1913, ' Researches in Colour 
Vision ' (p. 409), reference to similar experunental work is made. 
The writer, a few years ago, when considering other causes than those 
of deficient colour sensation which might prevent the recognition of 
colour, came to the conclusion that the optical condition of the eye 
might be of such a nature that small discs of coloured light might be 
taken as colourless or not seen at all. To confirm or disprove his 
diagnosis he made his eye myopic and observed a ship 's light from the 
sea-coast and also known stars, and found that with about half normal 
vision the ship's light at two miles was sometimes invisible or colour- 
less, and that only stars above the fourth or fifth magnitude could make 
any impression on the retina. 

Conclusion. 

There is abundant evidence to show that a number of disasters by 
land and sea are attributable to defective vision. There is also good 
reason for thinking that a larger number of accidents have occurred 
which have not been reported, and, as Mr. Nettleship says, they never 
will be reported under existing conditions. It is clear that, so long as 
the present mode of lighting ships and the present method of using 
railway signals are continued, form vision below 6/12 is dangerous 
as regards its effect on colour perception, and is dangerous by reason 
of the limitation of the range of vision in dull light, and I am of 
opinion that for the purposes of safety the minimum visual require- 
ments should be 6/9 in one eye and 6/18 in the other. A hyper- 
metropia of two diopti'es with astigmatism not exceeding '75 D might 
be permitted. The colour vision should be normal and tested both with 
wools and lights, and there should be no ocular disease. To satisfy 
these requirements it is necessary that all those who go to sea or 
enter the raihvay service to earn a livelihood should be examined at 



VISUAL REQUIREMENTS OF SAILOR AND RAILWAY EMPLOYEE. 268 

the outset of their career, since one complete ophthalmological 
examination at that period of life will enable the future vision of the 
examinee to be predicted with tolerable certainty. _ 

It will be seen that the method adopted by the Victorian Eailways 
would eliminate those who have a high degree of hypermetropia ; but 
it may admit those suffering from choroiditis with contracted fields, 
from glaucoma, and, in fact, any eye disease which is not obvious and 
which has no lowered central form vision. 

Stress need hardly be laid on the injustice perpetrated in allowing 
anyone to enter a seafaring life, to spend some years in acquiring pro- 
ficiency, and then subject him to a visual examination when he makes 
his appearance for his first professional examination. The sensible 
course is obviously to insist on a complete examination when the boy 
first goes to sea. 



Drij-Farmiuq Investigations in the United States. By Lyman J. 

Briggs, M.S., Ph.D. 

[Pr,ATE v.] 

(Ordered, on behalf of the General Committee, to be printed in ertmso.) 

The term ' dry-farming ' is now generally applied to agricultural 
practice in recfions where rainfall is the primary limiting factor m 
crop production. The determination of the tillage methods which are 
most efficient in the storage and conservation of moisture, and the 
development of varieties which are especially suited to dry-land con- 
ditions, are economic problems worthy of the best efforts of the 
agi'onomist. The most efficient methods are not always the most 
profitable methods, for the margin of profit in dry-farming is normally 
small, and the cost of tillage must always be compared with the 
return. Efficiency in the use of the limited rainfall is, however, the 
basis upon which dry-farming practice must be built. 

Before taking up the discussion of dry-fanning investigations in 
the United States, a word regarding the organisation of the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture in this connection may be of interest. Five 
offices in the Bureau of Plant Industry are devoting a large part of 
their energies to dry-farming problems. The Office of Dry-Land 
Agriculture operates over a score of experimental farms in various 
sections of the Great Plains. This office is concerned chiefly with the 
determination of the crop rotations and tillage methods which are best 
adapted to the various dry-farming sections. It was early recognised 
in the development of this work that dry-farming problems are often 
of an extremely local character, and that numerous experimental 
stations are necessary to cover the field. Each experimental farm is 
superintended by a trained agi-iculturist, usually an agricultural college 
graduate. These farms also afford experimental facilities for other 
offices engaged in dry-farming problems. The offices of Cereal Investi- 
gations, Forage Crop Investigations, and AlkaU and Drought-Resistant 
Plant Investigations ai-e engaged in the investigations of crops suited to 



201 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 

dry-land conditions ; while the Office of Biophysical Investigations, in co- 
operation with the above-named offices, is concerned with the study 
of the influence of various tillage methods on the absorption and reten- 
tion of rainfall, the water requirement of crops under field conditions, 
and the influence of climatic conditions on the growth of dry-land 
crops. Over oO.OOOZ. is now appropriated annually by Congress lor 
the support of the diy-land work. In addition to this, several of 
the States are also conducting dry-farming investigations on an exten- 
sive scale, either independently or in co-operation with the Govern- 
ment. The field of investigation is so extensive that the present paper 
will be confined largely to the biophysical phases of the work. 

Dnj-Farming Areas iu the United States. 

Two great dry-farming areas occur in the United States. One, 
the Intermountain area, lies between tlie Rocky Mountains on the 
east and the Sierra Nevada Mountains on the west. It is essen- 
tially a region of winter and spring rainfall. The other, the Great 
Plains area, extends from the Canadian boundary along the eastern 
side of the Eocky Mountains nearly to the Mexican boundary, and 
embraces over 200,000 square miles of land whose productivity is 
limited by the rainfall. This area, in contrast to the other, is a 
region of summer rainfall. 

These two great areas differ gi-eatly in their physiographic features 
and in their native plant cover. The Intermountain district is broken 
into numerous valleys, and the vegetation consists mainly of shrubby 
perennial plants, such as the sage-brush {Artemisia tridentata) 
(Plate V.) and a salt-bush (Atriplex confertifoUa). The size and 
character of this vegetation affords a good index of the productivity 
of the land.' The larger the sage-brush the greater the water-supply 
and the better the farm. The soils occupied by salt-bush, on the other 
hand, are apt to be so saline in character as to be unsuited to dry- 
farming. 

In the Great Plains no trees or shrubs are found except along 
the water-courses, while the gently undulating, grass-covered plain 
stretches unbroken to the horizon save for the buildings of the settlers. 
Much of this country is covered with buffalo grass (Bucliloe dacty- 
Inides) and grama grass (Boueteloua oligostachya) (Plate V.), while 
fartlier to the east, where the rainfall is somewhat heavier, the taller 
bunch grass [Andropogon scoparius) and wire grass (Aristida 
long-seta) make their appearance. ^ This striking difference in the 
vegetation, characterised by the shrubby plants in the Intermountain 
districts and by grasses on the plains, reflects the difference in the dis- 
tribution of the annual rainfall, which has had a marked effect upon 
the dry-farming development of the two sections.

Rainfall. 

It has become customary to use the average annual rahifall as a 
measure of the relative value of different areas for dry-farming pur- 
poses. Since the water-supply is usually the primary limiting factor, 
the annual rainfall must of course be emphasised. All who are 
engaged in dry-farming investigations recognise, however, the severe 
limitations of this classification. The seasonal distribution and tlie 
character of the rainfall — whether ton-ential or in the form of 
numerous light showers, or occurring as steady, soaking-rains — are often 
more important than the total annual rainfall in determining the pro- 
ductivity of a dry-farming region. The uncertainty of the rainfall 
should also be considered whenever sufficient statistical evidence is 
available.

Fro. 1.— Chart sliowing the monthly distribution of the rainfall at representative 
stations in the Great Plains, Intermountain, and Pacific coast regions. The 
length of the black lines in each diagram represents the monthly precipitation 
at that place, beginning with January on the left. The scale in inches given 
on the right of each diagram can be used to find the actual amount of the 
monthly rainfall. For example, the average monthly rainfall at Bismarck, 
N. Dak., for June is seen to be 3-J inches, while for July it is only a little more 
than 2 inches. It will be noted that in the Pacific coast region the rain comes 
principally at the beginning and end of the year, that is, in the winter ; in the 
Intermountain districts during the winter and spring months ; and in the Great 
Plains during the summer months. 

Eainfall is not the only factor of importance, however. We shall 
refer later to the desirabihty of knowing the seasonal evaporation as 
measured from freely exposed tanks, which affords a summation of 
those factors which determine the rate of transpiration. The maximum 
temperatures and the wind velocity are also important factors. For 
an adequate comparison of widely separated dry-farming areas, a know- 
ledge at least of the annual rainfall, its seasonal distribution, the

seasonal evaporation, and the depth and character of the soil appears 
to be indispensable. 

Eeference has already been made to the striking difference in the 
monthly distribution of the rainfall in the Great Plains as compared 
with the Intermountain districts. This difference is illustrated in 
fig. 1, which shows the monthly distribution of rainfall, at repre- 
sentative stations in each area. Three Pacific Slope stations with 
a distinctly winter type of rainfall are also included. In this latter 
region, owing to the mildness of the climate, an annual crop of wheat 
is gi^own during the winter months either for grain or hay. 

Grain-farming under the alternating fallow and cropping system 
has been satisfactorily established in Utah, where the annual rainfall 
is 13 inches or more. In the southern part of the State of Washing- 
ton, where the conditions are unusually favourable, land with an 
annual rainfall as low as 10 inches is used for growing winter wheat 
by the summer-fallow method,^ but the returns are uncertain. When 
the annual rainfall is reduced to 8"5 inches the crop will barely return 
the cost of production. 

The rainfall required when the rain comes chiefly in the summer 
is higher than for winter rainfall. This appears to be due to the 
greater evaporation-loss from the fallow when wet frequently by 
summer rains. In the Great Plains, where a summer rainfall prevails, 
dry-farming is not successfully conducted on an annual rainfall less 
than 14 inches, and this minimum is still higher in the southern part 
of the area, due, as we shall see, to the higher rate of evaporation. 

Evaporation. 

The evaporation-rate may faii'ly be considered as ranking next in 
importance to the annual rainfall in detennining the dry-farming 
possibilities of a region. The evaporation from a free-water surface 
represents a summation of the intensity of solar radiation, temperature, 
saturation-deficit, and wind velocity, all of which enter also into the 
determination of the transpiration-rate of the growing crop, though 
not necessarily in the same proportion as in free evaporation. Evapora- 
tion has been measured daily during the summer months at each of 
the experimental farms located in the dry-farming sections. Tanks 
6 or 8 feet in diameter and 2 feet deep are used, the tanks being 
sunk in the ground to within four inches at the top. The free-water 
surface is maintained at ground-level, i.e., about 4 inches from 
the top of the tank. Observations are now available for seven years 
at the stations first established. The observations are limited to 
the six months from April to September inclusive, since freezing 
weather is encountered at the stations during most of the remaining 
months. The average seasonal (April to September inclusive) evapora- 
tion in inches for each station, together with its location, is shown 
on the accompanying map (fig. 2). The evaporation increases rapidly 
as one proceeds southward in the Great Plains ; the evaporation in 
Northern Texas, for example, is 54 inches, compared with 31 inches

in the central part of North Dakota. Such differences have a profound 
influence upon the water-requirement of plants. 

Shantz * has shown that under practically uniform soil conditions 
a pure short-grass formation is found in Northern Texas with an 
annual rainfall of about 21 inches; in Eastern Colorado with an 
annual rainfall of about 17 inches; and in Montana with an annual 
rainfall of approximately 14 inches. The region throughout has a 
summer rainfall. The same plant formation then requires 50 per 
cent, more rainfall in Northern Texas than in Montana. The explana- 
tion of this is to be found in the difference in the evaporation-rate 
in the two sections. Eeference to fig. 2 will show that the evapora- 
tion in Northern Texas is approximately 60 per cent, higher than in 
Central Montana. A similar comparison between Northern Texas and 
North-E astern Colorado shows that short-grass requires about approx- 
imately 27 per cent, more rainfall in Northern Texas, where the 
evaporation is 23 per cent, higher than in North-Eastern Colorado. 
The effectiveness of rainfall depends of course upon its penetration 
into the soil, so that any relationship which may be developed 
between evaporation and precipitation will necessarily be an approxi- 
mate one. The above figures indicate, however, a rather close 
parallelism between the evaporation and the rainfall reqmired to 
maintain a given plant formation, and emphasise the necessity of 
knowing the evaporation as well as the rainfall in judging the dry- 
farming possibilities of a region.^ 

A direct relationship between evaporation and water-requirement — 
i.e., the pounds of water required by a plant in the production of a 
pound of dry matter — is shown in the following measurements by 
Briggs and Shantz of the water-requirement of the same strain of 
alfalfa when grown in different parts of the Great Plains (Table I.).

It will be seen that the water-requirement increases steadily as

also increases in a corresponding manner, so that the ratio of the 
water-requirement to the daily evaporation is approximately constant. 
Montgomery and Kiesselbach ° have shown that maize grown in a 
dry house and in a humid house varied in its water-requirement 
exactly in proportion to the relative evaporation-rates in the two 
houses. 

The water-requirement is not, however, always proportional to the 
evaporation. Other factors such as temperature may have a profound 
influence in determining the development of the plant. This may be 
illustrated by comparing the water-requirement of wheat and sorghum 
in Colorado and in Northern Texas (Table 11.).^ When the difference 
in evaporation is considered, sorghum is seen to have made a more 
efficient use of its water-supply in Texas than in Colorado, while the 
reverse is true in the case of wheat.

Influence of the Distribution of Rainfall on Farm Practice. 

The different distribution of the rainfall in the Intermountain district 
and the Great Plains has led to interesting differences in the farm 
practice of these regions. 

Spring wheat is not a successful crop in the Intermountain district 
for two reasons : (1) The land cannot be fitted for sowing until late in 
the season, owing to the spring rains ; and (2) the driest part of the 
season occurs when the spring wheat crop is maturing. A large acreage 
of winter wheat is, however, grown. In fact, the dry-farming activities 
of this section are devoted almost wholly to the growing of winter wheat. 
The stubble is. not usually ploughed until spring, the land being very 
dry and hard in the fall. The stubble also keeps the winter snows from 
drifting and thus holds the precipitation on the land. As soon as the

ment of Agriculture, Bureau of Plant Industry, Bulletin 284. p. 45 



270 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 

spring rains have ceased, the stubble and the early growth of weeds 
are turned under, and the land is kept fallow until the following 
autumn. The low rainfall during the summer makes it possible to 
destroy the weed-growth and maintain an efficient surface-mulch at 
a comparatively low cost. In the autumn, wheat is again sown. The 
crop makes a good part of its gi'owth while the temperature is cool 
and the evaporation low, and in addition to the stored moisture has the 
advantage of the seasonal precipitation during its growth period. 

One serious difficulty in dry-farming operations in regions of winter 
rainfall occurs in connection with the seeding of winter wheat on fallow 
land. The surface-mulch of the fallow is often dust-dry in the fall to 
a depth of 4 inches or more. If the farmer drills his grain in the 
dust, the seed remains inert until a rain occurs. If the first rain is 
insufficient in amount to soak through the dry mulch to the damp soil 
below, the seeds germinate, but the rootlets of the seedling plants do 
not reach the stored moisture below the intervening dry layer, and the 
plants soon die. On this account, farmers usually wait for fall rains 
before sowing wheat. If the seeding is thereby delayed until late in 
the fall, and freezing weather follows, the young plants are injured and 
weakened. And if this is followed by an ' open winter, ' so that the 
wheat plants are not protected by a covering of snow, ' winter killing ' 
is often very severe, and the crop is practically a failure. 

Drilling the wheat to a depth sufficient to place the seed in moist 
soil would appear to be a possible solution of this problem, but this is 
often found impracticable, and the seedling plants have gi'eat difficulty 
in forcing their leaves to the surface. It is possible that a solution of 
the difficulty may be found in a seed-drill which has recently been 
developed, which throws the dry surface-soil in ridges, and plants the 
grain in moist soil at moderate depths in the intervening furrows. This 
plan is not practicable in windy regions, for tHe furrows would soon 
fill with dry soil. 

In striking contrast with Intermountain practice, spring wheat is 
grown extensively in the Great Plains, especially in the central and 
northern part. The spring-sown crop escapes the dry fall and all 
danger from winter-killing, while the land, having been recently 
worked, is in better condition to absorb the summer rainfall. Inter- 
tilled crops are also grown to a much greater extent than in the 
Intermountain district, maize being especially popular in the noi'thern 
part of the Great Plains, and the non-saccharine sorghums (milo, kafir, 
sorgo) in the southern part. The intertilled crop has in many sections 
largely taken the place of fallow, spring wheat now being extensively 
grown on disked corn-land. 

Fallow, is used extensively in the Great Plains, but the experiments 
by the Office of Dry-Land Agriculture, under the direction of E. G. 
Chilcott,* have shown that alternate cropping and summer tillage in 
many sections is less profitable than simple three-year rotations, 
especially those in which spring wheat is grown on disked corn-land, and 
even less profitable than continuous cropping. Summer tillage is not

SO well adapted to a suinnier rainfall as to a winter precipitation, for the 
summer rains I'epeatedly pack the mulch, which necessitates frequent 
cultivation to keep the land in a receptive condition and to destroy 
the weeds v/hich spring up after each rain. Summer tillage, however, 
affords some insurance against total loss of a crop during a diy season, 
which means disaster to the farmer with work-animals and cows to feed, 
and this element of insurance will doubtless always be a factor with 
the small farmer, even if summer tillage does not give the greatest 
returns. 

Owing to the frequent high winds in the Plains, the blowing of the 
mulch on summer-tilled land sometimes becomes a serious problem. 
It is highly important in fallowing the Plains to keep the surface of 
the soil in a rough condition ; in other words, to maintain a clod-mulch 
on the fallow rather than a dust-mulch, a practice which is also 
advantageous in the absorption of rainfall. On lands subject to 
blowdng, the practice of cultivating in strips is sometimes followed. 
The strips are laid out at right angles to the prevailing winds, and 
alternating strips are planted to grain or an intertilled crop. Jardine ^ 
has i-ecently emphasised the value of the lister in checking blowing in 
extreme cases. This implement opens a broad shallow furrow, 
throwing the dirt on both sides. Groups of two or three furrows each 
are .listed at distances of from five to twenty rods across the field at 
right angles to the wind. The lister tends to form clods, while the 
disk harrow, except in moist ground, tends to pulverise the soil, and 
this must always be avoided in soils subject to blowing. 

Depth of Root Systevi in relation to Storage of Soil Moisture. 

The great depth to which the roots of many of our cultivated 
plants extend has a very important bearing on the practicability of 
storing moisture in the soil. Burr " has found that oats, spring 
wheat, barley, and corn growing on the loess soils of Eastern Nebraska 
use the water to a depth of 4 feet or more, while winter wheat 
feeds to a depth of 6 or 7 feet. Excavations made in winter- 
wheat plats in Utah showed the root system to extend to a depth of 
7 feet." 

In a soil which can store 6 per cent, of 'growth water,' there 
would be available in a section 6 feet in depth 600 tons of w-ater 
per acre, or enough for the production of thirteen bushels of wheat 
in the central Great Plains. i- For a root penetration of 4 feet, this 
amount would be reduced approximately one-third. 

When the system of alternate cropping and fallowing is employed, 
water seldom moves below the zone occupied by the roots of the 
wheat plant. This has taken place, however, at the Dickinson experi- 
mental farm in western North Dakota. The water which moves below 
the feeding zone is practically lost to the plant, and remains undisturbed

from year to year. An argument often advanced in favour of deep- 
ploughing is that the depth of root penetration is thereby increased. 
Tire futihty of this argument so far as dry-farm soils are concerned 
becomes evident when it is realised that the normal penetration of roots 
in the Intermountain and Great Plains soils is far below any depth 
that could possibly be reached with the plough. Deep ploughing may 
possibly increase the absorption-rate of rainfall when the precipitation- 
rate is so high as to saturate the surface soil temporarily, but this effect 
can also be secured by leaving the surface rough and corrugated when 
cultivating. Many of the field tests of the Office of Dry-Land Agricul- 
ture have failed to show any increase in yield from deep ploughing, 
an operation which means an added expense to an industry in which 
economy in labour must be rigidly exercised to show a reasonable 
profit. 

Loss of Water from Weeds. 

A relatively small propoi'tion of the total annual rainfall is con- 
served in the fallow. The maximum quantity of stored moisture 
available for the crop seldom exceeds 4 inches of rainfall in section^ 
where the annual rainfall ranges from ]3 to 18 inches. 
This low efficiency is due in part to loss from run-off, but mainly to 
surface evaporation and to loss through the transpiration of weeds. 
Numerous measurements have shown that a rainfall of less than one- 
half-inch does not contribute to the permanent store of moisture in 
the soil unless the surface soil is already wet from previous rains. 
If the rainfall penetrates the soil below a depth of 6 inches, its rate 
of loss due to evaporation is low. But if the fallow is weedy, the 
stored water is lost through the transpiration of the plants almost as 
rapidly as if the moist subsoil were freely exposed to the air. Tha 
water-requirement of weeds is fully as high as some of our most 
valuable crop plants. For example, pigweed (Amarannius retroflexus), 
tumble-weed {Amarantlixis gracizans), and Eussian thistle {Salsola 
jiestifer) have a water requirement as high as the millets and sorghums, 
while sunflower {Helianlhiis peliolarus) and lamb's quarters (Cheue- 
podmm album) rank higher than many of the legumes." The dry- 
farmer can, therefore, produce a valuable forage or grain crop with 
no greater expenditure of water per pound of dry matter than is lost 
through the weeds on his fallow. 

Determinations by W. W. Burr^' in Nebraska, E. W. Edwards '^ 
and J. G. Lill ^^ in Kansas, and C. B. Burmeister " in Texas, all 
unite in showing that the evaporation loss from land from which the 
weeds are sliced off with a hoe is but little greater than from culti- 
vated plants. In other words, cultivation is effective in conserving 
water mainly through the destruction of weeds rather than in the re- 
duction of surface evaporation. This is well illustrated by Dili's 
measurements at Gai'den City, Kansas, as shown in fig 3. The

moislure content of the mulched plat did not differ markedly from tlie 
plat on. which the weeds were kept sliced off with a sharp hoe; while 
the plat on which the weeds were allowed to grow was dried out to 
a depth of 3 feet. 

A striking example of the loss of moisture from ^^■eeds is also 
shown in experiments by P. V. Cardon, conducted at Nephi, Utah.^"^ 
Winter wheat was grown on four plats by the summer fallow system., 
one-half the plats being in wheat each year. Two plats were fall- 
ploughed each j'ear, and during the following summer, one plat was 
cultivated to destroy the weeds, while the other was left untouched 
except to clip the weeds in time to prevent the seeds maturing. In 
the autumn both plats were sown to winter wheat. The experiment 
was conducted for four years, and during this time the yield from the 
cultivated plat averaged four bushels more per acre than from the 
weedy plat. 

The loss of moisture in these plats as the season advanced, due to 
the demand made by the weeds, is illustrated in the accompanying 
graphs, fig. 4. That this loss is primarily due to the weed cover and 
not to direct evaporation is supported by the fact that in other experi- 
ments at this station spring-ploughed uncultivated fallow on which the 
weed-growth was slight was practically as effective as cultivated fallow 
in conserving moistm-e. The average moisture content (6 feet in 
depth) of the weedy Nephi plat was at the time of the spring sampling 
0'8 per cent, below the cultivated plat, and at the time of the Fall 
sampling 4^5 per cent, below the cultivated plat. This loss in moisture 
during the simimer is equivalent to 3'5 inches of rainfall stored in the 
soil. This amount of water is sufficient, according to the water- 
requirement measurements of Briggs and Shantz," to produce ten 
bushels of wheat per acre at Akron, Colorado, where the evaporation is 
the same as at Nephi. In 1911 the actual increase in yield of the 
cultivated plat over the weedy plat was eleven bushels per acre. 
During the other years the yield was reduced by winter killing, so that 
the water-supply was not the primary factor in determining production. 
Surely no more convincing proof is needed of the necessity of keeping 
fallow land free from weeds in regions where the moisture supply is 
of primary importance. 

Growth-water. 

It has long been known that a part of the soil-moisture is held so 
tenaciously that it is not available for the growth, of plants. Sachs 
in 1859 appears to have been the first to relcognise that the percentage 
of non-available moisture varies greatly with the type of soil. This is 
a matter of fundamental importance in the interpretation of soil- 
moistm-e observations, for the water unavailable for growth ranges 
from 1 per cent, or less in sand to 30 per cent, or more in the heaviest

types of clay.'* Obviously, then, the percentage of water in the soil 
that is available for the growth of plants, or the ' growth-water ' as 
Fuller^' has termed it, cannot be determined until this unavailable 
residue is known. 

Alway -° has used the hygroscopic coefficient, i.e., the percentage 
amount of water that a dry soil absorbs on exposure to a saturated 
atmosphere, to represent the unavailable portion. Briggs and Shantz -^ 
have measured the moisture-content at which plants undergo permanent 
wilting when gi'owing in a limited soil mass, protected from surface 
evaporation. By permanent wilting is meant a condition from which 
the plants cannot recover when exposed to a saturated atmosphere. ^^ 
The percentage of moisture remaining in the soil under such conditions 
has been termed the ' wilting coefficient ' of that particular soil, and 
has been found to vary slightly with the kind of plant used as an indi- 
cator. The ' wilting coefficient ' in connection with a total moisture 
determination provides a means for calculating the ' growth-water,' 
the latter being the surplus above the wilting coefficient. By the aid 
of such determinations it is possible to calculate the amount of stored 
growth-water — the bank-balance, so to speak, in the water account, 
against which the crop may draw. 

It is not necessary always to measure the wilting coefficient directly, 
since it can be calculated from other physical properties of soils that 
can be more readily measured. Thus the moisture equivalent, hygro- 
scopic coefficient, and mechanical composition have all been shown 
to bear a linear relationship to the wilting coefficient.-^ Of these 
indirect methods, that based on the moisture equivalent ^* is the most 
rapid and satisfactoiw. The latter represents the percentage of moisture 
remaining in the soil when brought into equilibrium with a centrifugal 
force 1,000 times that of gi'avity. The wilting coefficient is approxi- 
mately one-half the moisture equivalent. 

Where a small grain-crop has extended its root-system to a depth 
of 4 feet or more, the moisture-content of the second and third feet 
is sometimes reduced below the wilting coefficient. This is practically 
sure to occur if the crop is suffering for water, for plants are able to 
reduce the moisture-content far below the wilting coefficient while in a 
wilted condition, or during the ripening process. But it appears also 
to take place while the crop is still growing, provided the root-system 
is in contact with growth-water in some other part of the soil mass.-^

2- As the plant approaches a wilted condition its transpiration is reduced. Further- 
more, as soon as wilting occurs it is necessary to transfer the plant to a saturated 
atmosphere, in order to determine whether the observed wilting is temporary or per- 
manent. Consequently during the final stages of a wilting coefficient determination 
the transpiration rate is greatly reduced.

Fjg. 5. — Moisture conditions in spring wheat and fallow plats at Akron, Colorado, 
to a depth oi 6 feet. The dotted lines represent the wilting cccfficient for 
each foot-section. 



In other words, where the root-system is ah-eady estabhshed the 
crop is able to reduce tlie moisture-content below the wilting coefficient, 
and can use this to supplement the growth-water that it is drawing 
from lower levels. {Sec fig. 5, 1911.) On the other hand, crop-plants 



278 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 

show no tendency to send new roots into soil in which tlie moisture- 
content is reduced to the wilting coefficient. {See fig. 6, 1911.) 

An example of the application of the wilting coefficient to the inter- 
pretation of moisture determinations is shown in the accompanying 
measurements by W. M. Osborne -" at Akron, Colorado (fig. 5). The 
change in moisture during the season in each foot-section to a depth of 
6 feet is shown graphically by the solid lines. The dotted lines 
represent the wilting coefficient for each foot-section. The first chart 
(1911) represents the inoistm-e conditions under a crop of spring wheat 
during a dry season, the crop being practically a failure. It will be 
seen that in the spring there was available moisture in small amounts 
to a depth of 6 feet, the greater part being in the upper 3 feet. 
The crop had removed the growth-water from the first foot by June 1 ; 
from the second and third feet by June 15; from the fourth foot by 
July 15 ; while the fifth and sixth feet still contained a limited amount 
of growth-wat-er at harvest time, although the moisture had been 
reduced in each case. 

The second chart (1912) shows the moisture conditions in the 
same plat during the next summer while the land was in fallow. At 
the time the spring samples w^ere taken the moisture-content of the 
sui'face foot of soil was practically up to the field-carrying capacity of 
this soil. With the advent of the seasonal rains the surface foot began 
to deliver to the section below. It will be noted that the change in 
moisture-content does not take place simultaneously through the soil- 
mass, but is progressive from foot to foot, each section delivering water 
to the section below as it rises to its field-caiTying capacity. When 
the moisture supply is below a certain percentage, dependent upon 
the soil in question, capillary adjustment in that soil is very slow. 
_ Plants in order to avail themselves of all the growth-water must 
consequently develop a root-system which permeates the soil-mass 
from which water is being drawn. In other words, when the moisture 
supply is limited the capillary distribution becomes so slow as to be 
effective only through very small distances. Plants having a coarse 
root-system, such as maize, when used as indicator-plants, might be 
expected to give a somewhat higher wilting coefficient than plants 
with fine root-systems like the small gi'ains, and this has been observed 
to be the case.*' 

The first chart in fig. 6 represents the moisture conditions as 
measured by J. 0. Thysell -* in a barley plat at Dickinson, North 
Dakota, during the dry season of 1911. This plat is normally seeded 
to barley each year. Inspection of the chart will show that at the 
beginning of the season the moisture-content of the second and third 
feet was at the wilting coefficient, to which it had been reduced by 
the preceding crop. A good supply of growtk-water was present in 
the fourth, fifth, and sixth feet of the soil, but the roots were unable

In 1912 the crop was destroyed by hail, so that the plat was virtually 
in fallow during this season. The rainfall in 1912 was ample and the 
soil was well supplied with water in the spring of 1913, as shown 
in the second part of the chart. During this year a heavy crop of

llie soil in 1911, but unavnilable to tlie 1911 crop because the inter 
vening soil was reduced to the wilting coefficient before the root 
systein was established. It would be difficult to interpret thess 
moisture conditions without the aid of the wilting coefficient determina- 
tions, especially where the moisture-retentivity of the soil and sub- 
soil is not the same, as in the case of the Dickinson soils. 

The growth-water content at seedtime and harvest in two plats -at 
Akron, Colorado, is .shown graphically in fig. 7 for six years. These 
plats form part of the cultural experiments of the Office of Dry-Land 
Agriculture, and are continuously cropped to spring wheat, A being 
spring-ploughed and B fall-ploughed. The width of the shaded 
portion in each foot-section shows the amount of growth-water. It 
will be noted that the growth-water was in every instance practically 
exhausted at harvest-time, with the exception of the surface-foot, which 
in some instances had been moistened by rains near the harvest 
period. It also appears that at this station the time of ploughing has 
htlle influence on the soil moisture-content. 

Maintenance of the Fertilihj of Ihe Dry-Farm. 

The maintenance of fertility under a system of continuous grain- 
farming, such as is practised in many dry-farming sections, bids fan- 
to become a more and more serious problem as the years advance. 
The period of cultivation of much of the dry-farm land has been so 
short as to afford no information on this point. In any event, it is 
hardly a problem that can be taken up with the man who breaks the 
virgin land. His first concern is for bread, and his chief desire is to 
draw upon the resources of his land to its fullest cajiacity. It is only 
after a marked decrease in production has occurred that he will listen 
to measures designed to maintain the fertility of the soil. Happily, 
gi'ain-farming as practised on some of the oldest dry-farms in Utali 
does not yet appear to have diminished the productiveness of the soil. 
This is doulitless clue in part at least to the fact that the wheat has 
been cut with a header (or more recently with a combined harvester), 
which leaves most of the straw on the land. Stewart and Hirst"' 
have found that the humus and nitrogen content of the surface soil of 
the wheat lands farmed for ten years or more has not fallen below 
that of adjacent virgin soils. In an earlier investigation, Stewart '"' 
found that the oldest wheat lands in Utah, under cultivation for fourteen 
to forty-one years, either continuously or by summer-fallowing methods, 
had showed no loss in humus or nitrogen in the surface-foot. The second 
foot of the cultivated soils showed, however, a slightly lower nitrogen- 
content than the virgin land. The yield also appears to have been 
maintained. 

A wanton waste of organic matter occurs in many dry-farming 
sections in the northarn Great Plains and in California. The stubble 
is burned to make the ploughing easier and to destroy weed-seeds, and 
the straw-stacks are burned in the field because they are in the path 
of the ploughs. As the ploughing-season approaches, the horizon is

practised, live-stock kept, and the farm-manure used, the nitrogen 
content of tlae soil was maintained. This practice the dry-farmer of the 
Great Plains must eventually adopt as far as his conditions will permit, 
if a permanent agriculture is to he assured in these sec-tions. The 
American dry-farmer has much to learn from Australian practice in 
the use of stock, especially sheep, on the dry-farm. 

The Water-requirement of Different Dry-Farm Crops. 

A word must be said in regard to the importance of considering 
the water-requirement of crops grown on the dry-farm. Other things 
being equal, those crops which are most efficient in the use of water 
are obviously best adapted to dry-land conditions. The great success 
of millet, sorghum, and maize in American dry-farming is due in part 
at least to their remarkable efficiency in the use of water. The amount 
of water required for the production of a pound of dry matter of some 
strains of alfalfa is four times that required by millet, where the two 
crops are growing side by side. Different varieties of the same crop 
often exhibit wide differences in water-requirement. The following 
figui-es represent the range in water-requii'ement due to varietal differ 
ences as measured by Briggs and Shantz '^ in the Great Plains.

These wide crop and varietal differences in water-requirement 
suggest great possibilities in the development of strains for dry-land 
conditions. In fact, the measurement of the water-requirement affords 
a novel and promising method of attack in the breeding and selection 
of dry -land crops.

PliKSIDENT 'OF THE SECTION : 

rrofessor F. T. Trouton, M.A., Sc.D., F.E.S. 



Melbouene. 

Fin DAY, AUGUST 14. 

In the absence of the President, his Address was read by Professor 
A. W. Porter, F.R.S. :— 

We have lost sinee the last meeting of the Section several distinguished members 
who have in the past added so much to the usefulness of our discussions. These 
include Sir Robert Ball, who was one of our oldest attendants, and was President 
of the Section at the Manchester Meeting in 1887 : Professor Poynting, who was 
President of the Section at Dover in 1899 ; and Sir David Gill, who was 
President of the Association at Leicester in 1907. 

It seems appropriate at this meeting in the City of Melbourne to mention one 
who passed away from his scientific labours somewhat previous to the last meet- 
ing. I allude to W. Sutherland of 'this city, whose writings have thrown .so 
much light on Molecular Physics and whose scientific perspicacity was only 
equalled by his modesty. 

This meeting of the Briti.sh Association will be a memorable one as being 
indicative, as it were, of the scientific coming of age of Australia. Not that the 
maturity of Australian science was unknown to those best able to judge ; indeed 
the fact could not but be known abroad, for in England alone there are many 
workers in science hailing from Australia and New Zealand, who have enhanced 
science with their investigations and who hold many important scientific posts 
in that country. In short, one finds it best nowadays to ask of any young 
investigator if he comes from the Antipodes. 

This speaks well for the Universities and their staffs, who have so successfully 
set the example of scientific investigation to their pupils. 

Radio-activity and kindred phenomena seem to have attracted them most of 
late years, and it would perhaps have been appropriate to have shortly revieAved 
in this address our knowledge in these subjects, to which the sons of Australasia 
have so largely contributed. 

Twenty-five years ago FitzGerald and others were speculating on the possi- 
bility of unlocking and utilising the internal energy of the atom. Then came the 
epoch-making discovery of Becquerel, to be followed by the brilliant work of 
Rutherford and others showing us tliat no key was required to unlock this 
energy — the door lay open. 

We liave still facing us the analogous case of a hitherto untapped source of 
energy arising from our motion through the ether. All attempts, it is true, to 
realise this have failed, but nevertheless he would be a brave prophet who would 



286 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A. 

deny the possibility of tapping this energy despite the ingenious theories of 
relativity which have been put forward to explain matters away. There is no 
doubt but that up to the present nothing hopeful has been accomplished towards 
reaching this energy and there are grave difficulties in the way ; but ' Relativity ' 
is, as it were, merely trying to remove the lion in the path by laying down the 
general proposition that the existence of lions is an impossibility. The readiness 
with which the fundamental hypotheses of ' Relativity ' were accepted by many 
is characteristic of present-day Physics, or perhaps, more correctly speaking, 
is an exaggerated example of it. 

Such an acceptance as this could hardly be thought of as taking place half-a- 
century ago, when a purely dynamical basis was expected for the full explanation 
of all phenomena, and when facts were only iheld to be completely understood if 
amenable to such treatment; while, if not so, they were put temporarily into 
a kind of suspense account, waiting the time when the phenomenon would 
succumb to treatment based on dynamics. 

Many things, perhaps not the least among them radio-activity, have conspired 
to change all this and to produce an attitude of mind prepared to be content with 
a much less rigid basis than would have been required by the Natural Philo- 
sophers of a past generation. These were the sturdy Protestants of Science, to 
use an analogy, while we of the present day are much more catholic in our 
scientific beliefs, and in fact it would seem that nowadays to be used to anything 
is synonymous with understanding it. 

Leaving, however, these interesting questions, I will confine my remarks to a 
rather neglected corner of physics, namely, to the phenomena of Absorption and 
Adsorption of solutions. The term Adsorption was introduced to distinguish 
between Absorption which takes place throughout the mass of the absorbing 
material and those cases in which it takes place only over its surface. If, for 
instance, glass, powdered so as to provide a large surface, is introduced into a 
solution of a salt in water, we have in general some of the salt leaving the body 
of the solution and adhering in one form or other to the surface of the glass. It 
is to this the term Adsorption has been applied. Physicists have now begun to 
take up the question seriously, but it was to Biologists, and especially Physio- 
logical Chemists, that most of our knowledge of the subject in the past was due, 
the phenomenon being particularly attractive to them, seeing that so many of the 
processes they are interested in take place across surfaces. 

As far as investigations already made go the laws of Adsorption appear to be 
very complicated, and no doubt many of the conflicting experimental results 
which have been obtained are in part due to this, workers under somewhat 
different conditions obtaining apparently contradictory effects. 

On the whole, however, it may be said that the amount adsorbed increases 
with the strength of solution according to a simple power law, and diminishes 
with rise of temperature ; but there are many exceptions to these simple rules. 
For instance, in the case of certain sulphates and nitrates the amount adsorbed 
by the surface of, say, precipitated silica only increases up to a certain critical 
point as the strength of the solution is increased. Then further increase in the 
strength of the solution causes the surface to give up some of the salt it has 
already adsorbed, or the amount adsorbed is actually less now than that adsorbed 
from weaker solutions. Beyond this stage for still greater concentrations of the 
solutions the amount adsorbed goes on increasing as before the critical point was 
reached. 

There is some reason for thinking that there are two modes in which the salt 
is taken up or adsorbed by the solid surface. The first of them results from a 
simple strengthening of the solution in the surface layers; the second, which 
takes place with rather stronger concentrations, is a deposition in what is 
apparently analogous to the solid form. It would seem that the first reaches out 
from the solid surface to about lO-^ cm. — which is the order of the range of 
attraction of the particles of the solid substance. 

The cause of the diminution in the adsorption layer at a certain critical value 
of the concentration is difficult to understand. Something analogous has been 
observed by Lord Rayleigh in the thickness of layers of oil floating on the surface 
of water. As oil is supplied the thickness goes on increasing up to a certain 
point ; bevond this, on further addition of oil, the layer thins itself at some 



PKESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 287 

[jlaces and bccumes much thicker at others, intermediate tliicknesses to these 
being apparently unstable and unable to exist. As helping towards an explana- 
tion of the diminution in the adsorption layer, we may suppose that as the 
strength of the solution is increased from zero, the adsorption is at first merely 
an increased density of the solution in the surface layer. For some reason, 
after this has reached a certain limit, further addition of salt to the solution 
renders this mode of composition of the surface layers unstable, and there is a 
breaking up of the arrangement of the layer with a diminution in its amount. 
We may now suppose the second mode of deposition to begin to show its effect 
with a recovery in the amount of the surface layers and a further building up of 
the adsorption deposits. 

On account of passing through this point of instability the process is 
irreversible, so that the application of thermo-dynamics to the phenomenon of 
adsorption is necessarily greatly restricted in its usefulness. 

A possible cause of the instability in the adsorption layer wliich occurs at 
the critical point may be looked for in the alternations in the sign of the mutual 
forces between attracting particles of the kind suggested by Lord Kelvin and 
others. Within a certain distance apart — the molecular range — the particles of 
matter mutually attract one another, while at very close distances they obviously 
must repel, for two i^articles refuse to occupy the same space. At some inter- 
mediate distances the force must pass through zero value. It has for various 
reasons been thought that, in addition, the force has zero value at a second dis- 
tance lying between the first zero and the molecular range, with accompanying 
alternations in the sign of the force. Thus, starting from zero distance apart 
of the particles, the sign of the force is negative or repulsive ; then, as the dis- 
tance apart is supposed to increase, the force of repulsion diminishes, and after 
passing through zero value becomes positive or attractive ; next, as the distance 
is increased the force diminishes again, and after passing through a second zero 
becomes negative for a second time ; finally, the force on passing through a third 
zero becomes positive, and is then in the stage dealt with in capillary and other 
questions. 

As an instance of where these alternations of sign seem to be manifest, may 
be mentioned the case of certain crystals when split along cleavage planes. The 
split often runs along further than the position of the splitting instrument or 
inserted wedge seems to warrant. This would occur if the particles on either 
side of the cleavage plane were situated at the distance apart where the force 
between them was in the first attractive condition, for then, on increasing the 
distance between the particle.-* by means of the wedge, the force changes sign and 
becomes repulsive, thus helping the splitting to be propagated further out. 

Assuming that a repulsive force can supervene between the particles in the 
adsorption layer, through the particles becoming so crowded in places as to 
reduce their mutual distances to the stage when repulsion sets in, we might 
expect that an instability would be set up. 

As already stated, a rise in temperature reduces in general the amount 
adsorbed, but below the critical point the nitrates and sulphates are exceptional, 
for ri.se in temperature here increases the amount adsorbed from a given solution. 
This obviously necessitates that the isothermals cross one another at the critical 
point in an Adsorption-Concentration diagram. This may perhaps account for 
some observers finding that adsorption did not change with temperature. We 
have another exception to the simple laws of adsorption in the case of the alkali 
chlorides ; this exception occurs under certain conditions of temperature and 
strength of solution. The normal condensation into the surface layer is reversed 
and the salt is repelled into the general solution instead of being attracted by 
the surface. In other words, it is the turn of the other constituent of the 
solution, namely, the water, to be adsorbed. 

It is a very well known experiment in adsorption to run a solution such as 
that of permanganate of potash through a filter of sand, or, better, one of 
precipitated silica, so as to provide a very large surface. The first of the solution 
to come through the filter has practically lost all its salt owing to having been 
adsorbed by the surface of the sand. 

I was interested in finding a few months ago that Defoe, the author of 
' Robinson Crusoe,' in one of his other books, depicts a party of African travellers 



288 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A. 

lis being saved from thirst in a place where the water was charged with alkali 
by filtering the water through bags of sand. Whether this is a practical thing 
or not is doubtful, or even if it has ever been tried ; for it is only the first part of 
the liquid to come through the filter which is purified, and very soon the surface 
has taken up all the salt it can adsorb, and after that, of course, the solution 
comes through intact. It is interesting, however, to know that so long ago as 
Defoe's time the phenomenon of adsorption from salt solutions had been 
observed. It is not so well known that in the case of some salts under the cir- 
cumstances mentioned above, the first of the solution to come through the sand 
filter is stronger instead of weaker. This, as already mentioned, is because 
water, or at least a weaker solution, forms the adsorption layer. 

Most of the alkali chlorides as the temperature is raised show this anomalous 
adsorption, provided the strength of the solution is below a certain critical value 
differing for each temperature. For strengths of solution above these values 
the normal phenomenon takes place. 

No investigations seem to have been made on the effect of pressure on adsorp- 
tion. These data are much to be desired. 

The investigation of adsorption and absorption should throw light on Osmosis, 
as in the first place the phenomenon occurs across a surface necessarily covered 
with an adsorption layer, and in the second place, as we shall see, the final con- 
dition is an equilibrium between the absorption of water by the solution and that 
by the membrane. 

The study of the conditions of absorption of water throughout the mass of the 
colloidal substance of which osmotic membranes are made is of much interest. 
Little work has been done on the subject as yet, but what little has been done is 
very promising 

It is convenient to call the material of which a semi-permeable membrane is 
made the semi-permeable medium. The ideal semi-permeable medium will not 
absorb any salt from the solution, but only water, but such perfection is probably 
seldom to be met with. If a semi-permeable medium such as parchment paper 
be immersed in a solution, say, of sugar, less water is taken up or absorbed than 
is the case when the immersion is in pure water. The diminution in the amount 
absorbed is found to increase with the strength of the solution. It is at the 
same time found that the absorption or release of water by the semi-permeable 
medium according as the solution is made weaker or stronger is accompanied by 
a swelling or shrinkage greater than can be accounted for by the water taken up 
or rejected. 

The amount of water absorbed by a semi-permeable medium from a solution 
is found by experiment to depend upon the hydrostatic pressure. If the pressure 
be increased the amount of water absorbed by the semi-permeable medium is 
increased. It is always thus possible by the application of pressure to force the 
semi-permeable medium to take up from a given solution as much water as it 
takes up from pure water at atmospheric pressure. 

It is not possible for a mass of such a medium to be simultaneously in con- 
tact and in equilibrium with both pure water and with a solution all at one and 
the same pressure, seeing that the part of the medium in contact with the pure 
water would hold more water than that part in contact with the solution, and 
consequently diffusion would take place through the mass of the medium. 

If, however, the medium be arranged so as to separate the solution 
and the water, and provided the medium is capable of standing the necessary 
strain, it is possible to increase the pressure of the solution without increasing 
the pressure of the water on the other side. Thus the part of the medium which 
is in contact witli the solution is at a higher pressure than that part in contact 
with the pure solvent ; consequently the medium can be in equilibrium with both 
the solution and the solvent, for if the pressures are rightly adjusted the moisture 
throughout the medium is everywhere the same. 

The ordinary arrangement for showing osmotic pressure is a case such as we 
are considering, and equilibrium throughout the membrane is only obtained when 
the necessary difference in pressure exists between the two sides of the 
membrane. 

This condition would eventually be reached no matter Jiow thick the mem- 
brane was. It is sometimes helpful to think of the membrane as being very 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS, 289 

thick. It precludes any temptation to view molecules as shooting across from one 
liquid to the other thi-ough some kind of peepholes in the membrane. 

The advantage of a thin membrane in practice is simply that the necessary 
moisture is rapidly applied to the active surface, thus enabling the pressure on 
the side of the solution to rise quickly, but it has no effect on the ultimate 
equilibrium. 

As far as that goes, the semi-permeable membrane or saturated medium 
might be infinitely thick, or, in other words, there need be no receptacle or plate 
for holding the pure solvent outside the membrane at all. In fact, the function 
of the receptacle containing the pure solvent is only to keep the medium moist, 
and is no more or no less important than the vessel of water supplied to the 
gauze of the wet-bulb thermometer. It is merely to keep up the supply of water 
to the medium. 

The real field where the phenomenon of osmosis takes place is the surface of 
separation between the saturated semi-permeable medium and the solution. 
Imagine a large mass of colloidal substance saturated with water and having a 
cavity containing a solution. The pressure will now tend to rise in the cavity 
until it reaches the osmotic pressure — that is, until there is established an equi- 
librium of surface transfer of molecules from the solution into the medium and 
back from the medium into the solution. 

No doubt, the phenomenon as thus described occurs often in Nature. It is 
just possible that the high-pressure liquid cavities which mineralogists find in 
certain rock crystals have been formed in some such manner in the midst of a 
mass of semi-permeable medium; the pure solvent in this case being carbon 
dioxide and the medium colloidal silica, which has since changed into quartz 
crystal. 

In considering equilibrium between a saturated semi-permeable medium 
and a solution there seems to me to be a point whioh should be carefully con- 
sidered before being neglected in any complete theory. That is, the adsorption 
layer over the surface of the semi-permeable medium. We have seen that solu- 
tions are profoundly modified in the surface layers adjoining certain solids, 
through concentration or otherwise of the salts in the surface layer, so that the 
actual equilibrium of surface transfer of water molecules is not between the 
unmodified solution and the semi-permeable medium, but between the altered 
solution in the absorption layer and the saturated medium. Actual determina- 
tions of the adsorption by colloids are much wanted, so as to be able to be quite 
sure of what this correction amounts to or even if it exists. It may turn out to 
be zero. If there is adsorption, however, it may possibly help to account for part 
of the unexpectedly high values of the osmotic pressure observed at high con- 
centrations of the solution, the equilibrium being, as we have seen, between the 
^turated medium and a solution of greater concentration than the bulk of the 
liquid, namely, that of the adsorption layer. In addition, when above the 
critical adsorption point, there may be a deposit in the solid state. This may 
produce a kind of polarised equilibrium of surface transfer in which the molecules 
which discharge from the saturated medium remain unaltered in amount, but 
those which move back from the adsorption layer are reduced owing to this 
deposit, thus necessitating an increase in pressure for equilibrium. If either 
or both of these effects really exist, it would seem to require that the pressure 
should be higher for equilibrium of the molecular surface transfer than if there 
were no adsorption layer and the unaltered solution were to touch the medium, 
but at the same time it should be remembered that there is a second surface 
where equilibrium must also exist— that is, the surface of separation of the 
adsorption layer and the solution itself. It is just possible that the two together 
cancel each other's action. 

Quantitative determinations of absorption by solid media from solution are 
hard to carry out, but with a liquid medium are not so difficult. Ether con- 
stitutes an excellent semi-permeable medium for use with sugar solution, because 
it takes up or dissolves only a small quantity of water and no sugar. A series 
of experiments using these for medium and solution has shown (1) that the absorp- 
tion of water from a solution diminishes with the strength of the solution ; and 
(2) that the absorption of water for any given strength of solution increases with 
the pressure. This increase with pressure is somewhat more rapid than if it 

19M. u 



290 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A. 

were in proportion to the pressure. On the other hand, from pure water ether 
absorbs in excess of normal almost in proportion to the pressure. Certainly this 
is so up to 100 atmospheres. This would go to confirm the suggestion already 
made that the departure from proportionality in the osmotic pressure is attri- 
butable to absorption. 

By applying pressure ether can be thus made to take up the same quantity of 
water from any given solution as it takes up from pure water at atmospheric 
pressure. It is found by experiment that this pressure is the osmotic pressure 
proper to the solution in question. 

Decidedly the most interestmg fact connected with the whole question of 
osmotic pressure, the behaviour of vapour pressures from solution, and the 
equilibrium of molecular transfer of solutions with colloids, is that discovered 
by van 't Hoff, that the hydrostatic pressure in question is equal to what would 
be produced by a gas ihaving the same number of particles as those of the 
introduced salt. Take the case of a mass of colloid or semi-permeable medium 
placed in a vessel of water; the colloid when in equilibrium at atmospheric 
pressure holds what we will call the normal moisture. By increasing the pressure 
this moisture can be increased to any desired amount. Now, on introducing 
salt the moisture in the colloid can be reduced at will. The question is. What 
quantity of salt must be introduced just to bring back the amount of the 
moisture in the colloid to normal ? Here we get a gi'eat insight into the internal 
mechanism of the liquid state. The quantity of salt required turns out to be, 
approximately at least, that amount which if in the gaseous state would produce 
the pressure. So that normality can be either directly restored by removing the 
pressure or indirectly by introducuig salt in quantity which just takes up the 
applied pressure. That this is so naturally suggested that the salt, although 
compelled to remain within the confines of the liquid, nevertheless produces the 
same molecular bombardment as it would were it in the gaseous state, though of 
course the free path must be viewed as enormously restricted compared with that 
in the gaseous state. 

Many have felt a difficulty in accepting this view of a molecular bombard- 
ment occurring in the liquid state, but of recent years much light has been 
thrown on the subject of molecular movements in liquids, especially by Perrin's 
work, so that much of the basis of this difficulty may be fairly considered as now 
removed. 

Quite analogous to the reduction from the normal of the moisture held by a 
semi-permeable medium brought about by the addition of salt to the water, is 
the reduction in the vapour pressure arising from the presence of a salt in the 
water. The vapour pressure is likewise increased by the application of hydro- 
static pressure, which may be effected by means of an inert gas. In both cases 
the hydrostatic pressure which must be applied to bring back to normality is 
equal to that which the added salt would exert if it were in the state of vapour, 
or, in other words, the osmotic pressure. 

The two cases are really very similar. In both there is equal molecular transfer 
backwards and forwards across the bounding surface. In the one a transfer 
from that solution to the semi-permeable medium and back from it into the 
solution. In the other a transfer from the solution into the superambient vapour 
and back from it into the solution. 

The processes are very similar, namely, equal molecular transfer to and fro 
across the respective surfaces of separation. 

Thus we may in the case of osmotic equilibrium attribute the phenomenon 
with Callender to evaporation, but not evaporation in its restricted sense, from 
a free surface of liquid, but as we have seen from a saturated collodial surface 
into the solution. This process might perhaps be better referred to as molecular 
emigration, the term migration being already a familiar one in connection with 
liquid phenomena.

2. Mount StromJo Observatorij. By P. Baracchi. 

The Government of the Commonwealth, wishing to define a spot within the 
Federal Territory the meridian of which should be adopted as the Prime Meri- 
dian of Australia, to serve as the common longitude datum for all State surveys, 
decided to mark the spot by erecting upon it a small astronomical observatory 
which, if the selected site proved to be sufficiently good for the most delicate and 
important class of astronomical observation and research, was to be expanded 
and equipped as a modern observatory of the first order, including a department 
for the study of the sun. 

The site was selected in the year 1910 ; a concrete structure with an eighteen- 
foot dome was subsequently erected, and a nine-inch refractor by Grubb, equa- 
torially mounted, was installed in September 1911. 

With this instrument astronomical observations, visual, photographic and 
spectroscopic, were carried out during one week of each month in the year 1912 
and till April 1913, after which sufficient evidence was collected to show that the 
site was suitable for a first-class observatory. 

Since then this observatory has remained inoperative pending the decision of 
the Government as to its future. 

In this paper the site of the observatory, the instruments, and the work done 
were briefly described, with the object of placing sufficient information about this 
matter before the British Association to enable it to recommend to the Common- 
wealth Government the general lines on which this observatory should be 
enlarged and equipped, and what should be the programme of its future work. 



3. Proofs of {he Sun's Variahiltty. By C. G. Abbot. 

It has been shown by experiments of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observa- 
tory conducted simultaneously at Mount Wilson in California and Bassour in 
Algeria, in the years 1911 and 1912, that the values of the intensity of the solar 
radiation outside the atmosphere estimated by spectrobolometric observations at 
the two stations on the same days are, within the limits of error, identical. The 
measurements at the two stations agreed within an average deviation of about 
1 per cent. It appeared, however, that the values of the solar constant of 
radiation obtained deviated over a range of nearly 10 per cent, during the con- 
tinuance of the expeditions. This deviation was observed at both stations, 
so that if high values were obtained in California high values were obtained 
simultaneously in Algeria, and vice versa. Professor Turner has computed, from 
the observations, the coefficient of correlation between the results at the two 
stations. He finds this coefficient to be 52 per cent, plus or minus 7 per 
cent, if all the observations are used. Rejecting three observations of extreme 
doubtfulness, the correlation coefficient rises to 60 per cent. This furnishes very 
strong evidence of the variability of the sun, which appears to be irregular in 
period and irregular in amplitude, but may range over a course of 5 per cent, 
or even more within the lapse of a week. 

Measurements of the solar constant of radiation have been conducted on 
Mount Wilson in California by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory for 
about eight years, though unfortunately the observations have been confined to 
the months of summer and autumn, when the sky is favourable there for them. 
It is highly important that such work should be taken up at another station, or 
preferably at several other stations, where favourable conditions of the sky 
would be found in the other months of the year. 

When the monthly mean values of the solar constant as obtained on Mount 
Wilson are compared with the sun-spot numbers of Wolfer, it is found that 
increased sun-spot numbers correspond with increased values of the solar radia- 
tion and vice versa. Professor Turner has computed the correlation coefficient 
for these two variables as depending upon fifty months of observations, and 
finds this coefficient to be 5.3 per cent, plus or minus 7 per cent. Here also it i.^ 
seen that a strong proof of the variability of the sun's radiation exists. It 
appears therefore that the sun, besides varying from day to day in the manner 
shown by the combined Algerian and Mount Wilson observations, also varies 
from year to year in connection with the march of the sun-spot cycle.

In September 1913 a tower telescope, forming the image of the sun by the use 
of mirrors without lenses, and yielding an image of about 9 inches in 
diameter, was made ready in connection with the station of the Smithsonian 
Astrophysical Observatory on Mount Wilson. The image of the sun is caused 
to fall upon the slit of a spectrobolometer, which slit for this purpose is only 
about three-eighths of an inch in height. By stopping the clock of the telescope 
the solar image drifts centrally across the slit of the spectrobolometer, owing 
to the diurnal rotation of the earth. There is thus produced, by automatic 
registering of the indications of the bolometer, a curve of distribution of in- 
tensity along the diameter of the sun's disk. This curve takes the form of a 
letter U . The length of the straight sides of the \J may be taken as represent- 
ing the intensity of the solar radiation at the edge of the sun's disk, and the 
height of the U to the centre of the curve may be taken as representing the 
intensity of the radiation at the centre of the disk. Thus a contrast of the 
intensity of radiation along the diameter of the sun is made manifest. Obser- 
vations were made on nearly fifty days of the year 191-3 with this apparatus, and 
on each day the distribution of intensity at seven different wave-lengths of the 
spectrum between 3,700 Sngstroms and 10,000 Sngstroms was determined by 
making two curves at each wave-length. On the same days the solar constant 
of radiation was determined at Mount Wilson. 

Work with a similar object, but done in different ways, has been carried 
on by Vogel, Pickering, Langley, Very, Schwarzschild and Villager, and Abbot 
and Fowle. It is found by comparison of the distribution curves obtained at 
Mount Wilson in 1913 with others obtained by Abbot and Fowle in 1907, that a 
change of form of the distribution curve has occurred between these epochs. 
The contrast of brightness between the centre and edge of the sun in the year 
1907 was greater than the contrast found in the year 1913. This is verified at 
all wave-lengths, but the change of contrast is greater for short wave-lengths 
than for longer ones. 

It further appears, by comparison of results of one day with another in the 
year 1913, that a change of contrast of brightness is going on all the time, 
similar in irregularity of period and amplitude with the variation of the sun's 
total radiation which was foamd by comparison of IMonnt W^ilson and Bassour 
observations. When the daily values of the solar constant of radiation obtained 
in 1913 are compared with the distribution of brightness along the sun's 
diameter, it is seen that a close correspondence of variation occurs between the 
two. This daily variation is of such a nature that when the solar constant values 
increase the constant of brightness between the centre and edge of the sun 
diminishes. The result is contrary to that which was indicated by a few 
observations of Abbot and Fowle in the year 1908. It is believed on further 
examination that the results of Abbot and Fowle in 1908 were made erroneous 
by certain defects in the measurements of the solar constant of radiation on two 
or three days. The new results come from nearly fifty days of observation, and 
are quite definite in showing the connection between the variation of the radia- 
tion of the sun and the variation of brightness along the sun's diameter. 

It appears, however, that the correlation between solar constant values and 
contrast values between the years 1907 and 1913 is contrary in its sign to the 
correlation between these variables exhibited by the daily march of values for 
the year 1913. This may point to a greater complexity of the solar problem 
than was at first indicated by the results of Abbot and Fowle. It may be that 
the march of the sun-spot period attends an influence in one direction, while the 
march of short-period fluctuations of the solar radiation from day to day attends 
a change of contrast in the other direction. 



4. Discussion on the Present State of the Problem of Australian 
Longitudes. Opened by P. Baracchi. 

In Mr. Baracchi's paper were discussed the longitude values assigned to the 
two Australian meridians of Port Darwin and Southport (Queensland) ; these 
being, respectively, the terminals of the two chains of telegraphically deter- 
mined longitudes carried eastward from Greenwich via India, Singapore, and 



TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION A. 293 

Port Daiwiu, in one case, and westward through Canada and the Pacifiu Ucean 
to Southport (Queensland) in the other case. 

It was also shown that the connection between these two meridians obtained 
by means of the measured longitudinal arcs Port Darwin-Melbourne, Melbourne- 
Sydney, and Sydney-Southport (Queensland) completes a whole longitude circuit 
round the Earth, with a closing error of less than a hundred feet. 

The reality of such a small error was questioned, chiefly on the ground that 
larger discrepancies were found in the independent results of certain links which 
have been measured more than once. 

It was pointed out that in order to render the whole of this important longi- 
tude circuit homogeneous and reliable a re-measurement .should be made of the 
arcs Madras-Singapore, Singapore-Port Darwin, and Port Darwin-Southport 
(Queensland), adopting the highest refinements of modern practice and present 
instrumental means. 

The object of the paper was to enlist the sympathy of the British Association 
in this matter, and to obtain its advice as to the most practical and efficient plan 
of carrying out the work.

Joint Meeting with Section B (Chemistry). 

Discussion on the Structure of Atoms and Molecules. 

Sir Ernest Rutherford (abstract of remarks) : In recent times there ha.s 
been an accumulation of convincing evidence of the independent existence of 
the chemical atom. The atomic theory is no longer merely an hypothesis intro- 
duced to explain the laws of chemical combination ; we are able to detect and 
count the individual atoms. We can determine the actual mass of an atom in 
various ways, and know its value with considerable accuracy. The idea that the 
atom is an electrical structure received a great impetus by the detection of the 
electron by J. J. Thomson; and, moreover, the Zeeman effect showed that all 
atoms must contain electrons. The atomic character of negative electricity is 
well established; we always find the negative electron, however produced, 
carrying a definite charge. We have, unfortunately, not the same certainty 
with regard to the behaviour of positive electricity, for it cannot be obtained 
except associated with a mass comparable with that of a hydrogen atom. In 
J. J. Thomson's model of the atom the positive electricity was supposed 
(for mathematical reasons) to be distributed throughout a large sphere with the 
negative corpuscles moving inside it. This hypothesis has played a useful part 
in indicating possible lines of advance ; but it does not fit in with more recent 
discoveries, which point to a concentrated positive nucleus. 

We have now two powerful methods that aid us in determining the inner 
structure of the atom — the scattering of high-speed particles in transit through 
matter, and the vibrations of the interior parts of the atom. In C. T. R. 
Wilson's photographs of the tracks of the a particles through a gas we notice 
many sudden bends in the paths. In order to account for these deflections I 
have found it necessary to believe that there is a concentrated nucleus in the 
atom (having a certain number of units of charge), in which the main part of 
the mass resides; outside this there are a corresponding number of electrons. 
The whole dimensions of the nucleus are very small indeed compared with the 
distance of the outer electrons. From the scattering experiments it appears 
that the law of force right up to the nucleus is the inverse square law ; no 
other formula would give accordance with the observations. The radius of the 
nucleus is of the order 10-'" cm. in the case of gold, and for a lighter element 
it is smaller still. The approach of the a particle to the nucleus of the hydrogen 
atom when the latter is set into very swift motion is exceedingly close — a 
distance even less than the diameter of an electron. From this it is 
probable that the hydrogen nucleus is simply the positive electron with a large 
electrical mass due to the great concentration of the positive charge. Another 



294 TRA]!JSACTIONS OF SECTION A. 

fact that appears from the scattering experiments is that the number of elec- 
trons (outside the nucleus) is about half the atomic weight. There is now 
fairly good evidence that, if the elements are numbered in order of atomic 
weight, the numbers will actually express the charge on the nucleus. The rate 
of vibration of the inner parts of the nucleus can now be measured by means 
of the characteristic X-rays emitted. Each substance has several strong lines 
in its X-ray spectrum, and as we pass from element to element in order of 
atomic weight the frequencies of these change by regular jumps. H. G. J. 
Moseley has investigated all the known elements in this way, and he is even 
able to show at what points elements are missing, because at such points the 
X-ray frequencies make a double jump. In this way he has found that between 
aluminium and gold only three elements are now missing. It is deduced from 
these considerations that there is something more fundamental in the atom than 
its atomic weight, viz., the charge on the nucleus, and that this is the main 
factor which controls the frequency of the interior vibrations, the mass having 
only a slight influence. 

There are certain elements with identical chemical properties, but different 
atomic weights. Thus Eadium-B (atomic weight 214) and lead (207) are 
chemically inseparable and have the same y-ray spectrum. It is quite clear 
that some new conception is required to explain how the atoms, having the 
structure we have supposed, can hold together. N. Bohr has faced the diffi- 
culty by bringing in the idea of the quantum in a novel way. At all events, 
there is something going on in the atom which is inexplicable by the older 
mechanics. 

Professor Abmstrong : Although chemists must admire as well as welcome 
the bold attempt physicists are making to unravel the structure of the 
elementary atom, they cannot yet with advantage discuss the conclusions 
arrived at by their colleagues ; the arguments used are so novel and daring, the 
contentions so original, that at present they are not in a position to appreciate, 
still less to criticise them effectively ; in fact, the chemist's office at the 
moment must be mainly to point out the conditions that a theory must satisfy 
to meet his requirements. He has long been prepared to believe that the 
materials spoken of as elements may prove eventually to be compounds; indeed, 
the relationships between them are so similar to those manifest between carbon 
compounds, and of such a character, that it is almost necessary to believe in their 
composite nature ; but the views that are now advocated by physicists are 
entirely different from any conceptions that chemists have ever entertained and 
cannot easily be assimilated by them. Physicists, unfortunately, in the past 
have held aloof from chemists ; they have paid too little attention to their 
methods and to their results i the movement now in progress is therefore to be 
welcomed, as it must have the effect of leading the two parties in future to 
work together to a common end. Hence the value of the present discussion. 

It is doubtful if it be permissible at present to conclude that elements of 
different atomic weight may and do exist which are indistinguishable chemi- 
cally : the observations on which reliance is placed have been made with 
quantities of material far too small to permit of such an inference ; in the case 
of the rare earth elements, although very large quantities of material have been 
at the disposal of chemists, they have only slowly discovered differences by 
which they are enabled to distinguish and separate them. Though the special 
methods made use of by physicists are very powerful, they suffice only in 
certain cases and have little chemical significance ; when physicists resort to 
chemical methods the work becomes subject to ordinary criteria. 

The resemblance of the X-ray spectra of so many elements is undoubtedly 
most significant, but to conclude, on such evidence, that all but very few of 
the elements are discovered is scarcely justifiable ; it may well be that most of 
those that are known belong to a certain 'preferred ' type and that a particular 
series is nearly complete, the similarity of the spectra being perhaps due to the 
presence of a radicle common to the series, much as in the case of a series of 
related benzenoid compounds. In the case of carbon compounds, of the large 
number of series possible, it is well known that certain types are formed 
preferentially, being more stable or more readily produced than others. If the 
so-called elements are compound substances, it may well be that the occurrence

and prevalence of a certain type is determined in a somewhat similar way— 
that some one type has been preferred. 

Any theory of atomic structure to be satisfactory to chemists must take 
fully into account the peculiar valency relationships that are manifest among 
the elements, as the system of ' structural ' formulae now in vogue is based 
solely upon these. The system is admittedly one of extraordinary perfection 
and remarkably simple. In the case of organic compounds, the rules laid down 
have been found to be applicable and to suffice in so many thousands upon 
thousands of cases that it is impossible to doubt their general correctness; at 
most it will be necessary eventually to translate tliem directly into some new 
language. It should be pointed out, however, that so-called structural formulte 
are to be regarded as condensed symbolic expressions indicative of the general 
behaviour of the compoimds represented in terms of certain well-understood 
conventions, rather than as actual representations of structure. For example, 
it is customary to represent benzene by a regular hexagon, a symbol which is a 
complete expression of the chemical behaviour of the hydrocarbon. But the six 
carbon atoms are not to be thought of as arranged in a plane and in a ring in 
the manner depicted by the symbol; such an arrangement is impossible if the 
affinities of the carbon atom 'act tetrahedrally. The structure of benzene is 
rather to be represented by a model in which six carbon atoms (represented by 
six large spheres) are arranged three and three, in two superposed layers, union 
takingplace between an atom in one plane with a contiguous atom in the plane 
above, which in turn is united to that in the plane below — so that the atoms 
are connected in zigzag fashion ; and the six hydrogen atoms are to be thought 
of as severally united to the six carbon atoms in such manner that the hydrogen 
atom is always in a plane different from that which contains the carbon atom 
with which it is connected. If the ' atoms ' in such a model are squeezed down 
into one plane, the projection is practically identical with the ordinary ' centric ' 
symbol of benzene. The arrangement referred to is shown in the accompanying 
figures (see Plate). 

The fundamental assumption made by chemists, upon which their system 
of structural formulse is based, is that the hydrogen atom has unit valency— 
that it is incapable of acting as a linking element. The whole of the evidence 
available appears to be in favour of this view. The contention advanced 
recently by Sir J. J. Thomson, that hydrogen may occur as a triatomic molecule, 
H3, is therefore unacceptable ; until the existence of such a molecule has 
been proved up to the hilt it will be impossible for chemists to admit its 
existence. The artifice by which Sir Joseph Thomson has sought to reconcile 
his interpretations with those of chemists practically involves the representation 
of hydrogen as a dyad ; if this conclusion were accepted it would be necessary 
to double the valency of all other elements, a step which cannot be justified on 
chemical evidence. It is in cases such as these that a better understanding 
between chemists and physicists is required. 

The variation of valency is probably the most perplexing phenomenon in 
chemistry. It is doubtful if any element have a higher ' true ' or fundamental 
valency than carbon ; the view sometimes put forward that certain elements may 
function even as octads is based on evidence which in no way justifies such 
an assumption. Not only will it be necessary to account for the variation in 
valency from element to element but also for the fluctuations observed 
especially in the case of the non-metallic elements. The variation seems to be 
determined by some reciprocal relationship between the interacting elements, 
valency apparently being a dependent variable rather than an absolute pro- 
perty; thus, to quote examples, whilst the hydrocarbon, CR,. is non-existent 
and cannot exist per se, the corresponding oxide, carbonic oxide, CO, is not 
only stable but relatively inert, combining with other substances only under 
special conditions ; and the corresponding sulphur compound is so active that 
it cannot exist independently, but at once undergoes polymerisation with ex- 
plosive violence. Yet sulphuretted hydrogen occurs as a gas of simple mole- 
cular composition, whilst water, being a liquid of relatively high boiling-point. 
is presumably of considerable molecular complexity, so that it must be supposed 
that the fundamental molecule OHj is a highly active material. No theory of 



29G TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION A. 

atomic structure will be acceptable unless it can account for variations such as 
these. 

Besides considering variations in atomic properties such as have been 
referred to, it will be necessary also, in devising a theory of atomic structure, 
to take into account the fact that valency is a ' directed function.' The 
tetrahedron apparently is a complete embodiment of the properties of the 
carbon atom, in so far as these are due to directed forces, if the affinities of the 
atom be thought of as proceeding from the centre of mass to the four apices. 
Or if, instead of representing carbon by a sphere four times the volume of the 
unit sphere representing the hydrogen atom, four unit spheres be piled in 
tetrahedral form, the four hollows into which other similar spheres will fit 
are in positions representing the directions in which affinity acts. The great 
body of facts arrived at by studying optically active 'asymmetric' carbon 
compounds are all compatible with such modes of representing carbon : more- 
over, the hypothesis is the only one devised that sets the necessary limit to the 
number of isomerides possible. What is true of carbon is true apparently of 
other elements. But it is very noteworth,v that the affinity of carbon atoms 
for carbon atoms, as well as for those of many other elements, is extraordinarily 
strong in comparison with that of other elements for each other ; carbon has 
properties which are altogether peculiar. 

Fresh significance has been given to the problems of valency of late years 
owing to the introduction, by Barlow and Pope, of the conception that it is to 
be regarded as a function of the volume occupied by the atom. Assuming 
that the atoms are closely packed, they have succeeded to an extent which is 
altogether remarkable, by means of this hypothesis, in correlating crystalline 
form with molecular structure. Regarding the sphere within which the in- 
fluence of the hydrogen atom is exercised as unity, that of the dyad elements 
is twice, that of the triad three times, that of a tetrad element such as 
carbon four times, as great as that of the hydrogen atom. The halogens 
appear to occupy the same relative volume as hydrogen. A large body of evi- 
dence to this effect is to be found in a recent communication to the Royal 
Society (' Proc. R. Soc' A, vol. 90, p. Ill, 1914). Apparently, when an 
element such as an atom of halogen is introduced in place of hydrogen, the 
alteration in volume which attends the change is not simply due to the dis- 
placement effected by the new atom : the alteration in composition involves 
alterations in the spheres of influence of all the atoms in the molecule, so that 
their relative volumes remain the same though their actual volumes may vary. 

It is to be expected that many of the problems of molecular structure which 
in the past could not be considered, especially in the case of inorganic com- 
liounds, will now be amenable to treatment from the crystallographic side. 
The view originally put forward by Lavoisier and elaborated by Berzelius, that 
acids such as sulphuric acid are compounds of an acid oxide with ' water,' may 
be referred to as a case in point (see 'Proc. R. Soc' A, vol. 90, p. 73, 1914). 

In view of the production of helium in so many cases of ' atomic ' disrup- 
tion, it must not be forgotten that the problems of 'elementary' atomic struc- 
ture still require study on the chemical side. It is not to be supposed that they 
are no longer amenable to chemical treatment and that they are ripe for purely 
physical treatment. 

Professor Hicks : Professor Rutherford has approached the question chiefly 
from the side of radioactive phenomena, whilst Professor Armstrong has dealt 
with certain stereographic properties of the molecule which physicists must 
take account of in forming any theory of the structure of the atom itself. I 
propose to draw attention to certain aspects of the problem when approached 
from the spectroscopic side, /.c, from consideration of the atom as a configura- 
tion capable of emitting definite sets of free vibrations. Before doing so, 
however, I should like to offer some criticism with reference to a point raised 
by Professor Rutherford, viz., the actual value of the effective nuclear charge 
in any case. Moseley's law indicates that they are consecutive multiples for the 
consecutive elements in the periodic table, and they are known if that for one, 
say He, is known. What evidence we have seems to me rather to weigh in 
favour of He having an atomic number 4 in place of 2 which is assumed by 
Rutherford, Bohr, and Moseley himself. That it is at least 2 is clear from 



TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION A. 297 

the double charge on the a particle, but it does not follow when two of the 
movable electrons are freed that nine are left bound with the nucleus. The 
supposition that the atomic number for H is 1 and for He is 2, means that 
there are no intermediate elements between them. But there are several con- 
siderations which point to the existence of 2. (1) Nicliolson has given very 
weighty reasons for supposing that the lines observed in the corona, and in 
nebulae are due to two elements whose atomic weights lie between those of 
H and He, which he has called respectively Coronium and Nebulium. Their 
nuclear charges, however, are 4 and 5, which would make He 6. (2) Rydberg 
has proposed a theory of the constitution of the periodic table which has been 
remarkably justified in one respect by Moseley's measurements, in so far that 
it requires 32 elements between Kr and Ra-Em in place of 36 as hitherto 
supposed. The same reason which requires these 32 elements also requires 
2 between H and He. (3) In the July number of the ' Philosophical 
Magazine ' Rydberg has discussed Moseley's measurements of the frequencies 
of the Barkla K and L series, and finds that if N — the atomic number — be 
based on 4 for He, the frequencies of the lines can be represented by the follow- 
ing scheme : — 

K(a)andK(5) by P(N-3)2 P(N- 3 5)= 

L(a)andL(e) „ P(N-3x3)- P(N -3x3-5)2 

L(7)andL(8) „ P(N-4x3)= P(N-4x3-5)2 

but that such an arrangement is impossible if N be based on any other number 
than 4 for He. More exact numbers, however, are needed before these relations 
can be regarded as established. 

We already know certain definite facts as to the constitution of an atom. 
They are : — 

(1) All atoms contain electrons as a part of their constitution. Of these 
they can apparently lose a certain number without altering their chemical 
identity, whilst in the case of radioactive elements the loss of other sets 
changes them into different elements. We shall doubtless be justified in the 
assumption that the same law extends to all elements. 

(2) There exist also positively charged nuclei associated with the atomic 
mass, containing multiples of the fundamental electric charge, and the evidence 
tends to show that tlie chemical nature of the element is determined by this 
multiple. 

(3) In the case of a certain number of substances there are found associated 
magnetic doublets whose moments are multiples of a definite quantitv, called 
by Weiss the magneton. It appears legitimate to suppose that the same 
phenomenon may exist in other elements, though whether the magneton has an 
independent existence or is a consequence of electronic motion is an open ques- 
tion. If the latter, an explanation of the multiple quality will have to be 
sought for. 

Any theory of atomic structure must, then, be a theory of the way in which 
the atom is built up of these fundamental quantities. So far there are two 
types : (1) Thomson's theory of an extended positive nucleus within which the 
electrons revolve in Saturnian systems; (2) Rutherford's theory of an extremely 
small nucleus with electrons in planetary or Saturnian orbits. Neither of them, 
however, has shown the slightest aptitude in explaining the series laws of 
spectra. The actual structure must be a much more complicated one than is 
assumed in either. Unfortunately the complete mathematical treatment of the 
simplest case is one of extreme difficulty. We may, however, I believe, make 
one very important first step, viz., as to the direction in which to look for the 
source of the energy emitted in spectral radiations. This energy may arise 
either from small vibrations about a stable state or from change from one 
stable state to another. In both cases the stable states must be such as to 
lose no energy, and must therefore be in static equilibrium, or their relative 
motions must be such as to produce no change in an external field relative to 
itself — such as, for instance, a charged sphere moving with uniform velocity. 
In the first case the energy would be made up of extremely small amounts from 
all the atoms, and an increase in intensity would be due to increased ampli- 



298 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A. 

tudes. In the second case it is made up by relatively large amounts from a 
proportion only of the systems, and an increase would be due to a larger 
proportion of atoms changing from one system to another. In the first case, 
although the constancy of period follows as a matter of course, it is difficult 
to see how the conditions of Planck's quanta can be met, and that the ideas 
lying at the base of his theory are well founded there can be little doubt. 
In the second case the energy for each line is transferred in the same amount, 
and the constancy of the frequency follows at once from Planck's theory. 
These general considerations seem to point to the conclusion that the cause of 
spectral emission is change from one configuration to another of less internal 
energy. But there is experimental evidence pointing in the same direction. 
Stark has shown that the series lines in a spectrum are due to molecules which 
have lost one or more electrons. For instance, doublet series are due to 
molecules which have lost one electron, triplets two, &amp;c., and we should there- 
fore expect the energy emitted to be given out by their recombination to dlie 
neutral state. Since in general the larger proportion of spectral lines — both 
arc and spark — are either series or seem to be closely related to series lines, it 
would appear that change of state is one of the chief causes of radiation. 

A further consideration pointing in the same direction is afforded by the 
fact that the formulae to which series lines conform give the frequency itself, 
and not the square of the frequency, which latter is always the case when the 
forces of displacement are proportional to the displacements themselves. As 
Rayleig-h has pointed out, the former case requires forces proportional to the 
velocities, and hence suggests motion in magnetic fields. Now we' know these 
fields exist, and as a fact the only theory which reproduces Rydberg's formulae 
is that of Piitz, depending only on magnetic fields. Unfortunately electrostatic 
fields exist and must be taken account of. If we could conceive of shells of 
constant magnetic force produced by electric charges moving in such a way 
that the electric forces between the moving charges themselves are annulled, we 
should have made a first step towards forming a basis of a satisfactory theory. 
That such motions are possible is rendered probable from consideration of 
Maxwell's classical case of two uniformly charged parallel plates moving 
parallel to one another with the velocity of light. The great desideratum in 
the present state of the question is, not attempts at forming a complete theory, 
but mathematical discussions of as many simple cases as jiossible, in order to 
obtain a clearer comprehension of what such systems may be expected to 
explain. From this point of view the recent most suggestive paper of Conway 
on ' An Electromagnetic Hypothesis as to the Origin of Series Spectra ' ' is of the 
greatest value. We want more of a similar nature. 

Whilst, however, in all probability the greater portion of a spectrum is due 
to changes of configuration, it does not necessarily follow that lines related to 
the series are the only ones emitted. In fact, the high-frequency vibrations 
discovered by Barkla and measured quite recently by Moseley are clearly a case 
in point. Nicholson has determined recently the frequencies of small oscilla- 
tion of electrons revolving round positively charged nuclei on the basis of the 
Rutherford theory. More especially he finds that the sets of lines observed in 
the corona and in nebulae fit in very exactly for elements in which the nuclear 
charges are respectively 4 and 5, and the lines are due to neutral atoms 
and also to atoms which have lost or gained one or two or more electrons. The 
agreements are so close and so numerous as to leave little doubt of the general 
correctness of the theory. But the lines are certainly not connected in any way 
with the series type of line. Their appearance is probably due to the vast 
number of atoms in the corona and nebulae in the line of sight all emitting 
vibrations, whilst the absence of the series type may be due to the rarefaction 
of the gas causing comparatively few clianges from one configuration to another. 
Nicholson's theory stands alone as a first satisfactory theory of one type of 
spectra. Unfortunately this type contains so few examples that if they exist in 
other elements they have not been noticed. It affords considerable evidence 
that Rutherford's theory approximates to the actual case when the nuclear 
charge is a small multiple of the fundamental charge. Several attempts have 

' Phil. Mng. xxvi. p. 1010, December 1913, 



TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION A. 299 

been made to apply Planck's theory of radiation to the explanation of the laws 
of spectra. The most ingenious and suggestive is that of Bohr. It is based on 
the Rutherford atom, but throws no further light on the structure of the atom 
itself, as the mechanism of radiation is totally unexplained, and it is this 
which we are in search of. The most remarkable result is the derivation of the 
value of Rydberg's constant from known electric constants, and Planck's con- 
stant. This result has certainly caugilit the scientiiic imagination, and one feels 
convinced, especially on a first reading of his paper, that thei-e is some truth 
at the bottom of his theory. But Lindemann has pointed out, by consideration 
of dimensions, that a large number of theories would give values in which the 
various constants enter in the same way. In Bohr's theory the exactness of the 
numerical relation depends on an apparently arbitrary assumption as to the 
frequency of the energy emitted when an electron is combined. It is true that 
later he attempts to justify this by making his formula conform to certain 
observed properties of series. But with the introduction of this his value of 
Rydberg's constant ceases to be a direct deduction from his theory. Moreover, 
in doing so he assumes the frequency of an electron to be proportional to its 
angular velocity, which can only be the case for one electron — i.e., for an atom 
built on a planetary sj'stem, and not on a Saturnian, as is his. Nicholson has 
recently criticised the theory on other grounds, and as he is to take part in the 
discussion I will leave this point to him. From the spectral point of view the 
weightiest objection would seem to be that it is capable only of giving a 
formula of the Balmer type — which holds for hydrogen alone. In the best- 

N 

known series types, the P, S, and D depend on formulre of the type A-; r= 

■^ (m + M)-» 

The ti depend on atomic constants, and are always considerable for elements of 

large atomic weight. As the atomic weight diminishes we get the following 

general changes : — In P, ^u decreases to 1 ; in D it increases to 1 ; in S it 

approaches the value -5. In other words, for P and D the formulee approach a 

Balmer type. For H it is indistinguishable from Balmer's. For He, though 

approaching Balmer's, it is decisively not 1. As a fact, Bohr's theory does 

not represent any of the six known series of He, biit he postulates that certain 

lines hitherto allotted to H belong really to He. Moreover, he supposes He to 

have 2 electrons, whereas, as I have attempted to show above, the number 

is more probably 4. Fowler has recently presented a paper to the Royal 

Society in which he supports Bohr's allocation on observational grounds, but as 

it is not yet (August) published it is not possible to weigh the evidence. In 

concluding, I should like to say that although I have criticised certain parts of 

Bohr's theory adversely, no one can admire more its ingenuity and great 

suggestiveness. 

Mr. H. G. J. MosELEY explained the results of his classification of elements 

by their X-ray spectra. The frequency of the principal line in the X-ray 

spectrum is represented very closely by the formula 

7i=K (N-B) 

where K and B are constants, and N an integer increasing by a unit as we pass 
from element to element up the periodic table. If we take this atomic number 
N as ordinate, and the square root of the principal frequency as abscissa, the 
different elements will therefore give points lying approximately on a straight 
line. The secondary frequencies will at the same time give points on other 
straight lines. The order of the elements determined by N is nearly that of 
increasing atomic weight ; there are one or. two exceptions, and in such cases the 
order given by N, and not the atomic weight, is evidently the correct order cor- 
responding to chemical properties. For example, the atomic weight gives the 
order CI, K, A, whereas the X-ray frequency gives the order CI, A, K. The 
latter is the order required by the periodic table. There are between aluminium 
and gold four missing elements, indicated by the double jump of N required to 
make the formula fit. These correspond generally to gaps indicated also by the 
periodic law. 

Professor Nicholsox : I prefer not to introduce new difficulties, which would 
only make the discussion too long, and will therefore confine my remarks to 



300 TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION A. 

those points on which mj' opinion has been invited by Professor Hicks. 
Firstly, with regard to Bohr's theory, such criticisms as I have made are in the 
main mathematical, and therefore unsuitable for a joint discussion between 
physicists and chemists. But I can give a statement of the present position 
of the theory as it appears to me. When Bohr's theory is applied to a single 
nucleus of strength e or 2e, with a single rotating electron, it is remarkably 
successful in its deduction of the hydrogen series spectrum and of the Pickering 
series which it ascribes to helium. Its most striking success is, I think, not 
the very accurate deduction of the universal constant of spectra, but its appli- 
cation by Professor Fowler in his Bakerian lecture to a determination of the 
mass of an electron, on the supposition that the Pickering series comes from 
helium. The accuracy of this value cannot be ignored. But analysis shows 
that it is quite impossible to go further, and to derive the usual helium 
spectrum. I mean that in order to do so we must abandon at least one of 
Bohr's premises which is vital to the deduction of the hydrogen formula. 
This fact is capable of rigorous demonstration, as is also the fact that, under 
the inverse square law, which Sir Ernest Rutherford has shown experimentally 
to be valid, Rydberg's constant is not a feature of more complex atoms on this 
theory. 

There is also an experimental difficulty. Whatever its origin, the Pickering 
series should be accompanied by an ultra-violet one in the Schumann region. 
This series has been found by Professor Lyman in the hydrogen spectrum, 
whereas helium appears to have no Schumann spectrum. Professor Lyman is 
repeating these experiments, in view of their importance, but the balance of 
experimental evidence is against Bohr's theory at present. 

I am inclined to agree with Mr. Moseley that my nebular and coronal 
elements may not be chemical elements in the ordinary sense. This opinion, 
that they are sub-elements, or bases of ordinary elements, will be found in my 
papers. Bourget, Buissoii, and Fabry's experiments, described in the 
' Comptes Rendus,' show that these substances have the atomic weights which 
I calculated theoretically from their spectra, so that their existence appears 
to be real. Moreover, as in my papers, ordinary elements with series spectra 
can apparently only be formed from them by an alteration in the nucleus which 
does not affect its total charge. Evidence is accumulating to show that the 
imclear structure may play an important part in series spectra, and therefore 
I am not inclined to agree with Professor Rutherford that the nucleus of a 
hydrogen atom is necessarily the positive electron. It seems to be more 
complicated. But with everything else in his admirable opening address I 
must express a general agreement. I must finally agree with Mr. Moseley that 
any ultimate atomic theory must involve Planck's /;. In my own papers this 
was regarded as an angular momentum, as subsequently also by Bohr. The 
necessity for it is easily seen. For we only have one dynamical relation between 
the radius of the atom and the angular velocity of its electrons. Without 
the introduction of some new universal constant such as h no atom has any- 
thing in its nature which compels a definite size, and definite unchanging 
properties. 

Professor H. Bassett said that, as the number of elements which came 
before neon seemed of considerable importance in connection with the 
theoretical treatment of the constitution of the atom, it might be worth while 
considering whether the periodic law gave any hints on the matter. It was 
well known that Lothar Meyer's atomic volume curve clearly demonsfrated 
that, although the properties of the elements were periodic functions of their 
atomic weights, the periodicity was not of such a simple character as at first 
supposed by Newlands. Leaving out hydrogen for the moment, it was found 
that there were two short periods of eight elements each, beginning with neon 
and argon, and ending with fluorine and chlorine respectively, followed by two 
long periods of 18 elements — ^that was to say, of (2x8) -1-2 elements. These two 
long periods were followed by one very much longer period and a portion of a 
second. Unfortunately this very long period was so far incompletely known, 
and it was not certain how many elements it contained; but this much could 
be said, namely, that it contained approximately twice as many elements as 
one of the long periods, and possibly 33 elements, which would be (2x18) -1-2 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A. 301 

elements. Now, going back to the region in which hydrogen was situated, one 
was tempted to suggest that this gas was the only known representative of an 
extra short period of three elements. Doubling this number and adding two 
one obtained eight — the number of elements in each of the known short periods. 
Doubling eight and adding two one obtained eighteen — the number of elements 
in each of the long periods, and so on. Although such treatment of the matter 
might appear like playing with figures, it seemed to the speaker of some interest. 

Professor Kerr Grant summarised the difficulty as to the stability of a 
system consisting of one nucleus and one electron. It was difficult, too, to 
account for the non-magnetic character of the hydrogen atom with this struc- 
ture. Magnetism, however, depended probably more on molecular than on 
atomic structure. 

Sir E. Rutherford (replying) said that the chemical inseparability of certain 
isotopes was, indeed, derived from experiments with small quantities, but the 
methods used were very delicate. The separation of Radium D from lead was 
a most important problem; there seems evidence that different leads exist, 
having different atomic weights. The difficulty of stability is common to all 
theories- of the atom; but what it points to is that there is something wrong 
with the theory of electromagnetic radiation — not of the atom.

By Professor W. M. Hicks, F.R.S. 

Weiss has proved the existence of elementary magnetic magnets — or their 
equivalent — as a constituent of the atoms of matter. These magnetons should 
act as very effective scatterers of a and /3 rays, but the mathematical difficulties 
of a complete discussion of the scattering by a single electron are probably 
extremely great. The particular case where the electrons move in an equatorial 
plane of the magneton admits, however, of a complete mathematical solution, 
and may be useful as throwing some light on the nature of the scattering to be 
expected. It is essentially a question of the orbits of charged particles coming 
from an infinite distance, and in the paper the nature and distribution of these 
are explained. Incidentally also a theory of combined electrons appears.

Discussion on Antarctic Meteorology. Opened by G. C. Simpson, B.Sc. 

1. A brief resume was given of the general circulation in the atmosphere 
over the Southern Hemisphere as taught by : 

(a) the text-books. 

(h) Dr. Lockyer in his paper ' Southern Hemisphere Surface Air Circulation.' 

(f) Professor Meinardus in his discussion of the result of the 'Gauss' 
•Antarctic Expedition. 

Dr. Lockyer suggests an intense anticyclone over the Antarctic Continent, 
from which cold air feeds into a series of large cyclones circulating the southern 
ocean and having their centres near to 60° S. The cyclones are supposed to be 
so large that while their southern extremities sweep over the edge of the 
Antarctic Continent their northern extremities reach to latitude 40° S., and so 
dominate the weather of Tasmania and New Zealand, and to some extent that 
of South Australia. 

Professor ]\Ieinardus's scheme also includes a series of cyclones travelling 
from west to east over the southern ocean; but he gives strong reasons against 
the presence of an anticyclone over the southern continent. His chief objection 
to such an anticyclone is that anticyclonic conditions are accompanied by an 
excess of evaporation over precipitation ; hence it would be impossible to account 
for the excess of precipitation which gives rise to the large glaciers and snow- 
fields which discharge the known large quantities of ice. 

2. The simultaneous observations made at Cape Evans, Cape Adare, and 
Framheim were then considered to inve.'^tigate the processes which are at work 
in the Eoss Sea area. Diagrams showing the mean temperature distribution 
both horizontally and vertically were examined, and the curves of barometric 
pressure and wind at the different stations compared. The chief con- 
clusions of the investigation are as follows : The high south-easterly winds— 
commonly called blizzards— are not caused by cyclones passing into the 
Eoss Sea, but are the result of the large differences of temperature 
which exist in the lower atmosphere over the Barrier and the Eoss Sea. The 
cloud observations show that air feeds into the Antarctic at high levels, and 
passes north again in the blizzards. Meinardus's objection that in such a 
circulation of air precipitation would not exceed the evaporation was shown 
not to hold, because of the great cooling of the air due to radiation. The air 
while sinking loses so much heat by radiation that, when forcibly made to rise 
in the blizzards, saturation is reached at a much lower level than that at which 
the air entered. Thus anticyclonic conditions are consistent with an excess of 
precipitation. 

3. The existence of a belt of cyclones between the Antarctic Continent and 
Australia was then considered. Curves on which barometer and wind obser- 
vations made at the ' Gauss ' winter quarters are plotted were shown. From 
them it was seen that during the passage of deep waves of pressure there 
is practically no variation of the wind direction at that station. In most 
cases the wiiid blows a gale from the east both while the barometer falls rapidly 
and while it makes an equally rapid recovery. At present it appears quite impos- 
sible to reconcile the wind" and barometer observations with any system of 
circulation of wind about a centre of low pressure moving from the west to the 
east. Further the simultaneous barometer observations at Melbourne, the Bluff 
(New Zealand), and Cape Adare were examined without finding any certain 
indication of the same cyclone affecting the northern and southern stations. 

4. The monthly departures from normal of pressure at Cape Evans were 
compared with corresponding values for stations in Australasia, and an important 
negative correlation was found. 

5. In conclusion the importance of a permanent meteorological station on 
tlie Antarctic Continent was urged.

3. The Action of the Juice of Euphorbia peplus on a PJiotographlc 
Plate. By J. M. Petrie and H. G. Chapman. 

The dried milky juice of Euphorbia -pcplu.s acts on a sensitive photographic 
plate in the dark. If a photographic plate, separated by a space of 3 mm., is 
exposed for fourteen days to the dried juice spread in the form of letters on 
glass, sharp images of the letters appear as positive impressions on the plate on 
development in the ordinary way. Faint images are formed by exposures for 
such short periods as twenty-four hours, and deeper impressions, but still sharp 
and well-defined, by exposures up to thirty-one days. The impressions on the 
plate are more marked when the separation is diminished to 1 mm., and no 
impression appears when the separation is increased to 12 mm. The images are 
characteristically well defined, though there is slight diffusion around each letter. 

If a piece of black paper, impervious to light, be inserted between the letters 
and the plate, the images appear as well defined as when the paper is absent. 
The intervention of paraflfined tissue paper fails to prevent the appearance of the 
image on the plate. Images are seen when thin aluminium foil and gold leaf are 
used to separate the plate from the letters. The impression can be obtained 
through thin sheet glass. When a strong current of air is passed between the 
letters and the plate during the exposure, the image appears sharp and no 
evidence of diffusion in the direction of the current can be made out. 

On examining the dried juice with a sulphide screen no scintillation of 
particles can be seen. On testing the dried juice in a gold leaf electroscope 
there is no apparent increase in the rate of discharge of ionised gases. With a 
sensitive electrometer no action of the dried juice on ionised air could be 
detected. 

On heating the dried juice, the photographic action is not diminished after 
several hours' heating to 200° C. When charred to a black mass the juice has a 
diminished action on the plate, and when incinerated to a white ash the ash 
retains a feeble action. 

This photographic action has been noted with all specimens of Euphorbia 
peplus e.xamined by us from many localities, some at least a hundred miles apart. 
The dried juice retains its action unchanged, so that the original sample, dried 
and mounted five years ago, is as active as ever. 

The juices of many other species of Euphorbia, and of other plants with 
similar latex-bearing tubes, have no comparable action on the photographic plate.

The work summarised herein is a continuation of an investigation by Porter 
and Keen '■ on the diffraction of light by particles comparable with the wave- 
length. In that work the scattering was produced by a sulphur suspension, and 
observations were restricted to the transmitted light. In the present paper the 
degree of polarisation has been determined (by means of a double-image prism 
and nicol) for the light scattered in different directions; and suspensions of 
silver and copper have been investigated as well as suspensions of sulphur. The 
metallic suspensions were made by the method of Pieroni,^ which we have found 
to give stable suspensions. 

The results for sulphur particles show a good general agreement with the 
theoretical values calculated by Lord Rayleigh,' but exact comparison is not 
possible owing to the difficulty of determining the size of the particles. In the 
ease of the silver particles comparison with theory is easier, because the total 
amount of silver present can be so readily determined chemically, the number 
of particles per unit volume can be counted, and thence their size can be 
calculated. Measurements of the size were also made by Perrin's method, i.e., 
by counting the number of particles in each of two layers a small vertical 
distance apart, and attributing the difference (as in an atmosphere of gas) to 
the total weight of particles in the intervening space. Both methods give 
practically the same results. 

Complete curves have been obtained for the polarisation for different-sized 
particles in different directions. Mention will be made here only of the direction 
of maximum polarisation for silver suspensions for light of wave-length 550^/*.

According to J. J. Thomson/ the direction of maximum polarisation for 
perfectly conducting particles should make 120° with the incident light. From 
the above table it appears that for very small particles this angle is 90°, as it 
would be for dielectric particles (a fact which we find was previously observed 
by Professor R. ThrelfalP), but that it increases as the diameter of the particle 
increases to a value above the theoretical limit. 

Measurements were also made of the electrical conductivity of the sus- 
pensions. Since the average distance between the particles was about 100 times 
their diameter, Maxwell's theory of the conductivity of compound media is 
applicable. The conductivity was measured in every case for concentrations 
containing the same amount of silver and other bodies per unit volume, but 
differing only in the size of the particles. In these circumstances the con- 
ductances should be the same unless there is a difference in the conductivity of 
the silver particles. It will be seen that the conductivity of the mixture in- 
creases as the particles increase in size. It would seem, therefore, that the 
anomalous behaviour of the silver is due to a real change in resistance with size, 
and is not simply a consequence of the fact that Thomson's theory is limited to 
the cases for which the conductivity is sufficiently large. 

No numerical calculation has previously been made for large particles. By 
transferring Thomson's equations so as to express the result in terms of the same 
functions which have been calculated by Lord Rayleigh for fairly large values 
of the argument, his work becomes available for the present problem ; and one 
of us (E. T. P.) has calculated the degree of polarisation of the light scattered 

in different directions for perfectly conducting particles for which '- 

A 

= unity, when \ = wave-length of the light. The maximum polarisation corre- 
sponds to an angle for about 108°. The value indicated by our experiments 
lies between 110° and 120°, but further experiments are necessary to fix it more 
exactly. 

It is not difficult to suggest a reason for the diminution of the conductivity 
with size. Separated molecules, as in a vapour, are jierf ectly non-conducting ; 
we conclude that there are then no free electrons. Aggregation of molecules 
of silver as in a solid gives rise to free electrons (and consequent conductivity) 
owing to the mutual action of the molecules upon one another. In small particles 
the number of free electrons may be proportionately less than for silver in mass. 

It must not be forgotten, however, that a colloid particle in its medium is 
surrounded by a double layer consisting of polarised molecules of the medium, 
and it is quite piossible that it is this polarised layer of a dielectric medium 
which modifies the optical properties of the silver.

the fundamental equation f{x) = 0. 

The coefficient of 6"-i in the number R(e) we call its principal coefficient. The 
orders of coincidence of such number relative to the prime yi will be integral multiples 
of certain numbers l/i^,, . . ., Ifv,, where c,, . . ., c,. are factors of »,, . . ., n,. 
respectively. We consider the aggregate of numbers R(e) possessing an assigned 
set of orders of coincidence relative to p. The necessary and sufiicient condition 
that the principal coefficient in the aggregate be integral is that the assigned orders 
of coincidence have a certain set of values. This particular set of orders of co- 
incidence defines adjointness relative to the prime ^j with regard to the fundamental 
equation. 

If we start out from a sufficiently general rational form R(6) with its coefficients 
represented in padio form and impose on it the conditions requisite in order that it 
may possess a certain set of orders of coincidence relative to the prime p, these con- 
ditions take the form of a succession of independent congruences relative to the 
prime p imposed on the coefficients of the powers of p in the jj-adic coefficients of 
the powers of 6. We find a formula for the number of these conditions. We also 
assign sets of orders of coincidence t,"", . . . t^;'1 corresponding to all primes 

p, tliese orders of coincidence being with the exception of a finite number among 
them. Such a system of orders of coincidence we call a basis of coincidences. We 
define complementary adjoint bases of coincidences and derive the analogue of the 
complementary theorem in the tlieory of the algebraic functions.

The equation of the Limagon is taken in the form r = a (1-f e cos 6), a will be

The LimaQon is symmetrical about the x- axis ; so therefore is its evolute. 

(1) When e = 0, the Limajon is a circle ; the evolute is a point, the centre of the 
circle. 

(2) When i - e &gt; 0, the evolute is a closed curve with four cusps pointing outwards. 
These cusps are D,(e/, e'^Vj), D",(e ^-eW/), C.,{c,0), C',(c',0). All four lie on the 
circle y'^-\-(x~c) {x—c') = 0. As e increases, this at first star-like figure grows larger, 
the total height approaches VSfi as e approaches ^, the breadth (parallel to the 
X- axis) increases indefinitely.

circle of infinite radius ; the x- axis may be regarded as two coincident asymptotes. 

(4) When 1 &gt; e &gt; |, there are two asymptotes making equal angles with the x- axis. 
As e increases from J to 1 the angle between the asymptotes increases from 0° to 180°, 
their intersection, V, moves from { — cc, 0) to the origin; the cusp C precedes V 
from(— cc, 0) to (0, 0); the distance D D' increases to a maximum 4 v'3/9 when 
e = V{2/3), and then dwindles to 0. 

(5) When c = 1, the Limafon is a cardioid, the evolute is also a cardioid; it passes 
through the origin, its cusp C is at (2/3, 0) ; the three cusps C, D, D', coincident at 
the origin, become a simple point on the cardioid. 

(6) When e&gt; 1, the cusps D, D' have disappeared, the cusps C, C point inwards, 
the curve is closed, the shape of the curve does not change much as e increases, the 
distance C C diminishes from 2/3 to i, the total height (parallel to the y- axis) increases 
from 1/3/2 to 1, the breadth, now less than the height, diminishes from 3/4 to 1/ \/2. 

(7) When c = oo, the evolute is altogether at infinity; the difference c— c' is 
found to be finite and equal to J, likewise the height, 1 , the breadth, 1/ •\''2 ; the position 
of the breadth, y V2, above and below C C enable an illustrative figure to be drawn. 
It is symmetrical about its central ordinate.

The theory of modules of polynomials is still only in its infancy, although

Generale des Equations Algebriques,' par M. Bezout, de I'Academie Eoyale des 



TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION A. 311 

Sciences, m.dcc.lxxix. Its status and importance were made apparent by 
Kronecker's theory of Divisor Systems. 

The central problem (of which no satisfactory solution has yet been given) 
is to find one or several ways of expressing the complete conditions that a 
polynomial F must satisfy in order that it may be capable of taking the form 

F = XiFi + X2F2+ . . . +XkFi, 

where F,, Fj, . . . , Fk are given polynomials (in general non-homogeneous) in 
n variables a;,, x,, . . . , a;", and X,, X^, . . . , Xt are any polynomials in the 
same variables, not given. The whole system of polynomials F is called a 
module (of polynomials), and is regarded as a single entity or class, and is 
symbolised by a letter M. Each F is called a member of M, and the set of 
polynomials F,, F,, . . . , Fa; is called a basis of M. 

A module M is considered from its two conjugate aspects, viz. (i) its content 
as represented by its members, and (ii) its content as represented by its modular 
'equations, i.e., the linear equations which are identically satisfied by the 
coefficients of each and every member F of M. (ii) has received little attention 
hitherto. Either (i) or (ii) gives a complete representation of the module; but 
the difiSculty is to obtain (ii) from (i) and vice versa. In combination (i) and (ii) 
give a very complete view of a module and afford together a simple answer to 
most general questions. Thus the members of the G.C.M. of any number of 
modules consist of all the members of all the modules: the modular equations 
of tlie L.C.M. of any number of modules consist of all the modular equations 
of all the modules ; the members of the product MM' of two modules M and 
M' can be obtained at once from the members of M and M' ; and the modular 
equations of a residual M/M' can be obtained at once from the modular 
equations of M and the members of M'. 

The most important types of modules were considered ; these are the unmixed 
module, prime module (corresponding to a prime number in arithmetic), primary 
module (corresponding to a power of a prime in arithmetic), simple module (that 
is, a module containing one point only), module of the principal class, perfect 
module, and closed module. The method of obtaining the modular equations 
from a basis of the module was discussed, and also the resolution of a module 
into primary modules.

Brisbane. 
FBI DAY, AUGUST 22. 



Professor E. W. Brown, F.R.S., Vice-President of the Section, delivered the 
following Address : — 

To one who has spent many years over the solution of a problem which is 
somewhat isolated from the more general questions of his subject, it is a satisfac- 
tion to have this opportunity for presenting the problem as a whole instead of in 
the piecemeal fashion which is necessary when there are many separate features 
to be worked out. In doing so, I shall try to avoid the more technical details of 
my subject as well as the temptation to enter into closely reasoned arguments, 
confining myself mainly to the results which have been obtained and to the 
conclusions which may be drawn from them. 

In setting forth the present status of the problem, another side of it gives one 
a sense of pleasure. When a comparison between the work of the lunar theorist 
and that of the observer has to be made, it is necessary to take into consideration 
the facts and results obtained by astronomers for purposes not directly connected 
with the moon : the motions of the earth and planets, the position of the observer, 
the accuracy of star catalogues, the errors of the instruments used for the 
measurement of the places of celestial objects, the personality of the observers — 



312 TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION A. 

all these have to be considered ; in fact, almost every one of the departments of 
the astronomy of position must be drawn upon to furnish necessary data. The 
time has now arrived when it may perhaps be possible to repay in some measure 
the debt thus contracted by furnishing to the astronomer, and perhaps also to the 
student of geodesy and, if I may coin a word, of selenodesy, some results which 
can be deduced more accurately from a study of the moon's motion than in any 
other way. A long-continued exploration with few companions which ultimately 
leads to territories where other workers have already blazed paths gives the 
impression of having emerged from the thick jungle into open country. The 
explorer can once more join forces with his brother astronomers. He can 
judge his own results more justly and have them judged by otliers. If, 
then, an excuse be needed for overstepping the limits which seem, by silent 
consent, to have been imposed on those who devote themselves to lunar problems, 
it consists in a desire to show that these limits are not necessary and that a study 
of the motion of the moon can be of value and can contribute its share to the 
common funds of astronomy. 

The history of the motion of the moon has been for more than two centuries 
a struggle between the theorists and the observers. Ever since the publication 
of the ' Principia ' and the enunciation of the law of gravitation by Isaac 
Newton, a constant effort has been maintained to prove that the moon, like the 
other bodies of the solar system, obeyed this law to its farthest consequences. 
While the theory was being advanced, the observers were continually improving 
their instruments and their methods of observing, with the additional advantage 
that their efforts had a cumulative effect : the longer the time covered by their 
observations, the more exact was the knowledge obtained. The theorist lacked 
the latter advantage : if he started anew he could only use the better instru- 
ments for analysis provided by the mathematician. He was always trying to 
forge a plate of armour which the observer with a gun whose power was increas- 
ing with the time could not penetrate. In the struggle the victory rarely failed 
to rest with the observer. Within the last decade we theorists have made 
another attempt to forge a new plate out of the old mat/;rials ; whether we have 
substantially gained the victory must rest pai'tly on the evidence I have to place 
before you to-day and partly on what the observer can produce in the near future. 

There are three well-defined periods in the history of the subject as far as a 
complete development of the moon's motion is concerned. From the publication 
of the ' Princi]3ia ' in 1687, when Newton laid down the broad outlines, until the 
middle of the eighteenth century, but little progress was made. It seems to have 
required over half-a-century for analysis by symbols to advance sufficiently far 
for extensive applications to the problems of celestial mechanics. Clairaut and 
d'Alembert both succeeded in rescuing the problem from the geometrical form 
into which Newton had cast it and in reducing it to analysis by the methods of 
the calculus. They were followed by Leonard Euler, who in my opinion is the 
greate.st of all the successors of Isaac Newton as a lunar theorist. He initiated 
practically every method which has been used since his time, and his criticisms 
show that he had a good insight into their relative advantages. A long roll of 
names follows in this period. It was closed by the publication of the theories of 
Delaunay and Hansen and the tables of the latter, shortly after the middle of 
tlie nineteenth century. From then to the end of the century the published 
memoirs deal with special parts of the theory or with its more general aspects, 
but no complete development appeared which could supersede the results of 
Hansen. 

My own theory, which was completed a few years ago, is rather the fulfilment 
to the utmost of the ideas of others than a new mode of finding the moon's 
motion. Its object was severely practical — ^to find in the most accurate way and 
by the shortest path the complete effect of the law of gravitation applied to the 
moon. It is a development of Hill's classic memoir of 1877. Hill in his turn 
was indebted to some extent to Euler. His indebtedness would have been 
greater had he been aware of a little-known paper of the latter, ' Sur la Variation 
de la Lune,' in which the orbit, now called the variation orbit, is obtained, and 
its advantages set forth in the words : ' Quelque chimerique cette question j'ose 
assurer que, si Ton reussissoit a en trouver une isolution parfaite on ne trouveroit 
presque plus de difficulte pour determiner le vrai mouvement de la Lune reelle. 



TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION A. 313 

Cette question est done de la derniere importance et il sera tonjours bon d'en 
approfondir toutes les dilKcultes, avant qu'on en puisse espei'er une solution 
complete.' 

In the final results of my work the development aims to include the gravita- 
tional action of every particle of matter which can have a sensible effect on the 
moon's motion, so that any differences which appear between theory and observa- 
tion may not be set down to want of accuracy in the completeness with which 
the theory is carried out. Every known force capable of calculation is included. 

So much for the theory. Gravitation, however, is only a law of force : we 
need the initial position, speed, and direction of motion. To get this with 
sufficient accuracy no single set of observations will serve ; the new theory must 
be compared with as great a number of these as pos.&lt;!ible. To do this directly 
from the theory is far too long a task, and, moreover, it is not necessary. In the 
past every observation has been compared with the place shown in the ' Nautical 
Almanac ' and the small differences between them have been recorded from day 
to day. By taking many of these differences and reducing them so as to 
correspond with differences at one date, the position of the moon at that date 
can be found with far greater accuracy than could be obtained through any one 
observation. At tlie Greenwich Observatory the moon has been observed and 
recorded regularly since 1750. With some 120 observations a year, there are 
about 20,000 available for comparison, quite apart from shorter series at other 
observatories. Unfortunately these observations are compared with incorrect 
theories, and, in the early days, the observers were not able to find out, with the 
accuracy required to-day, the errors of their instruments or the places of the 
stars with which the moon was compared. But we have means of correcting the 
observations, so that they can be freed from many of the errors present in the 
results which were published at the time the observations were made. We can 
also correct the older theories. They can be compared with the new theory and 
the differences calculated : these differences need not even be applied to the 
separate observations, but only to the observations combined into properly chosen 
groups. Thus the labour involved in making use of the earlier observations is 
much less than might appear at first sight. 

For the past eighteen months I have been engaged in this work of finding the 
differences between the old theories and my own, as well as in correcting those 
observations v.'hich were made at times before the resources of the astronomer 
had reached their present stage of perfection. I have not dealt with the observa- 
tions from the start : other workers, notably Airy in the last century and Cowell 
in this, Jiave done the greater part of the labour. My share was mainly to 
carry theirs a stage further by adopting the latest theory and the best modern 
practice for the reduction of the observations. In this way a much closer agree- 
ment between theory and observation has been obtained, and the initial position 
and velocity of the moon at a given date are now known with an accuracy com- 
parable with that of the theory. I shall shortly return to this problem and 
exhibit this degree of accuracy by means of some diagrams which will be thrown 
on the screen. 

I have .spoken of the determination of these initial values as if it con- 
stituted a problem separate from the theory. Theoretically it is so, but prac- 
tically the two must go together. The increase in accuracy of the theory 
has gone on successively with increase in accuracy of the determination of 
these constants. We do not find, with a new theorj', the new constants from 
the start, but corrections to the previously adopted values of these constants. 
In fact, all the problems of which I am talking are so much inter-related that 
it is only justifiable to separate them for the purposes of exposition. 

Let us suppose that the theory and these constants have been found in 
numerical form, so that the position of the moon is shown by means of 
expressions which contain nothing unknown but the time. To find' the moon's 
place at any date we have then only to insert that date and to perform the 
necessary numerical calculations. This is not done directly, on account of the 
labour involved. What are known as ' Tables of the Moon's Motion ' are 
formed. These tables constitute an intermediate step between the theory and 
the positions of the moon which are printed in the ' Nautical Almanac' 
Their sole use and necessity is the abbreviation of the work of calculation

required to predict tlie moon's place from the theoretical values which have 
been found. Fot this reason, the problem of producing efficient tables is not 
properly scientific : it is mainly economic. Nevertheless, I have found it 
as interesting and absorbing as any problem which involves masses of calcula- 
tion is to those who are naturally fond of dealing with arithmetical work. 
My chief assistant, Mr. H. B. Hedrick, has employed his valuable experi- 
ence in helping me to devise new ways of arranging the tables and making 
them simple for use. 

A table is mainly a device by which calculations which are continually 
recurring are performed once for all time, so that those who need to make 
such calculations can read off the results from the table. In the case of the 
moon, the tables go in pairs. Each term in the moon's motion depends on an 
angle, and this angle depends on the date. One table gives the value of the 
angle at any date (a very little calculation enables the computer to find this), 
and the second table gives the value of the term for that angle. As the 
same angles are continually recurring, the second table will serve for all time. 

We can, however, do better than construct one table for each tei'm. The 
same angle can be made to serve for several terms and consequently one table 
may be constructed so as to include all of them. In other words, instead 
of looking out five numbers for five separate terms, the computer looks out 
one number which gives him the sum of the five terms. The more terms 
we can put into a single table the less work for the astronomer who wants 
the place of the moon, and therefore the more efficient the tables. A still 
better device is a single table which depends on two angles, known as a 
double-entry table; many more terms can usually be included in this than in a 
single-entry table. The double interpolation on each such table is avoided 
by having one angle the same for many double-entry tables and interpolating 
for that angle on the sum of the numbers extracted from the tables. 

The problem of fitting the terms into the smallest number of tables is a 
problem in combinations — something like a mixture of a game at chess and a 
picture-puzzle, but unlike the latter in the fact that the intention is to produce 
ease and simplicity instead of difficulty. This work of arrangement is now 
completed and, in fact, about five-sixths of the calculations necessary to form 
the tables are done ; over one-third of the copy is ready for the printer, 
but, owing to the large mass of the matter, it will take from two to three 
years to put it through the press. The cost of performing the calculations 
and printing the work has been met from a fixnd specially set aside for the 
purpose by Yale University. 

A few .=itatistics will perhaps give an idea of our work. Hansen has 
300 terms in his three co-ordinates, and these are so grouped that about a 
hundred tables are used in finding a complete place of the moon. We have 
included over 1,000 terms in about 120 tables, so that there are on the average 
about eight terms per table. [In one of our tables we have been able to 
include no less than forty terms.] Each table is made as extensive as possible 
in order that the interpolations — the bane of all such calculations — shall be 
easy. The great majority of them involve multiplications by numbers less 
than 100. There are less than ten tables which will involve multiplications by 
numbers between 100 and 1,000 and none greater than the latter number. The 
computer who is set to work to find the longitude, latitude, and parallax of the 
moon will not need a table of logarithms from the beginning to the end of 
his work. The reason for this is that all multiplications by three figures or 
less can be done by Crelle's well-known tables or by a computing machine. 
But Mr. Hedrick has devised a table for interpolation to three places which 
is more rapid and easy than either of these aids. It is, of course, of use 
generally for all such calculations, and arrangements are now being made for 
the preparation and publication of his tables. The actual work of finding the 
place of the moon from the new lunar tables will, I believe, not take more 
time — perhaps less — than from Hansen's tables, as soon as the computer has 
made himself familiar with them. Fortunately for him, it is not necessary 
to understand the details of their construction : he need only know the rules 
foT using them. 

I am now going to show by means of some diagrams the deviations of the 



TRANSACTIOKS OF SECTION A. 315 

moon from its theoretical orbit, in which, of course, errors of observation are 
included. The first two slides exhibit the average deviation of the moon from 
its computed place for the past century and a half in longitude, i The averages 
are taken over periods of 414 days and each point of the continuous line 
shows one such average. The dots are the results obtained by Newconib from 
occupations ; the averages for the first century are taken over periods of 
several years, and in the last sixty years over every year. In both cases the 
same theory and the same values of the constants have been used. Only 
one empirical term has been taken out— the long-period fluctuation found by 
Newcomb having a period of 270 years and a co-efficient of 13". I shall show 
the deviations with this term included, in a moment. 

The first point to which attention should be drawn is the agreement of the 
results deduced from the Greenwich meridian observations and those deduced 
from occultations gathered from observatories all over the world. There can be 
no doubt, that the fluctuations are real and not due to errors of observation. 
A considerable difference appears about 1820, for which I have not been able to 
account, but I have reasons for thinking that the difference is mainly due to 
errors in the occultations rather than in the meridian values. In the last sixty 
years the differences become comparatively small, and the character of the 
deviation of the moon from its theoretical orbit is well marked. This deviation 
is obviously of a periodic character, but attempts to analyse it into one or two 
periodic terms have not met with success; the number of terms required for 
the purpose is too great to allow one to feel that they have a real existence, 
and that they would combine to represent the motion in the future. The 
straight line character of the deviations is a rather marked peculiarity of the 
curves. 

The actual deviations on a smaller scale are shown in the next slide; the 
great empirical term has here been restored and is shown by a broken line. 
The continuous line represents the Greenwich meridian observations; the dots 
are Newcomb's results for the occultations before 1750, the date at which the 
meridian observations begin. With a very slight amount of smoothing, 
especially since 1850, this diagram may be considered to show the actual 
deviations of the moon from its theoretical orbit. 

The next slide shows the average values of the eccentricity and of the 
position of the perigee. ^ The deviations are those from the values which I have 
obtained. It is obvious at once that there is little or nothing systematic about 
them; they may be put down almost entirely to errors of observation. The 
diminishing magnitude of the deviations as time goes on is good evidence for 
this ; the accuracy of the observations has steadily increased. The coefficient 
of the term on which the eccentricity depends is found witli a probable error of 
0"-02, and the portion from 1750 to 1850 gives a value for it which agrees with 
that deduced from the portion 1850 to 1901 within O/'-Ol. The eccentricity is 
the constant which is now known with the highest degree of accuracy of any 
of those in the moon's motion. For the perigee there was a difference from 
tlie theoretical motion which would have caused the horizontal average in the 
curve to be tilted up one end over 2" above that at the other end. I have taken 
this out, ascribing it to a wrong value for the earth's ellipticity; the point will 
be again referred to later. The actual value obtained from the observations 
themselves has been used in the diagram, so that the deviations shown are 
deviations from the observed value. 

The next slide shows the deviations of the mean inclination and the motion 
of the node, as well as of the mean latitude from the values deduced from 
the observations.' In these cases the observations only run from 1847 to 1901. 
It did not seem worth while to extend them back to 1750 for it is evident 
that the errors are mainly accidental, and the mean results agreed so closely 
with those obtained by Newcomb from occultations that little would have been

gained by the use of the much less accurate observations made before 1847. 
The theoretical motion of the node differs from its observed value by a 
quantity which would have tilted up one end of the zero line about 0/I-5 above 
the other ; the hypothesis adopted in the case of the perigee will account for 
the difference. 

The mean latitude curve is interesting. It should represent the mean 
deviations of the moon's centre from the ecliptic ; but it actually represents the 
deviations from a plane O'f-5 below the ecliptic. A similar deviation was found 
by Newcomb. Certain periodic terms have also been taken out. The explana- 
tion of these terms will be referred to directly. 

The net result of this work is a determination of the constants of eccen- 
tricity, inclination, and of the positions of the perigee and node with practical 
certainty. The motions of the perigee and node here agree with their theoretical 
values when the new value of the earth's ellipticity is used. The only out- 
standing parts requiring explanation are the deviations in the mean longitude. 
If inquiry is made as to the degree of accuracy which the usual statement of the 
gravitation law involves, it may be said that the index which the inverse 
square law contains does not differ from 2 by a fraction greater than 
1/400,000,000. This is deduced from the agreement between the observed and 
theoretical motions of the perigee when we attribute the mean of the differences 
found for this motion and for that of the node to a defective value of the 
ellipticity of the earth. 

I have mentioned the mean deviation of the latitude of the moon from the 
ecliptic. There are also j)eriodic terms with the mean longitude as argument 
occurring both in the latitude and the longitude. My explanation of these was 
anticipated by Professor Bakhuysen by a few weeks. The term in longitude had 
been found from two series of Greenwich observations, one of 28 and the other 
of 21 years, by van Steenwijk, and Professor Bakhuysen, putting this with the 
deviations of the mean latitude found by Hansen and himself, attributed them 
to systematic irregularities of the moon's limbs. 

What I have done is to find (1) the deviation of the mean latitude for 
64 years, (2) a periodic term in latitude from observations covering 55 years, 
and (3) a periodic term in longitude from observations covering 150 years, 
the period being that of the mean longitude. Further, if to these be added 
Newcomb's deviations of the mean latitude derived («) from immersions and 
(h) from emersions, we have a series of five separate determinations — separate 
because the occultations are derived from parts of the limb not wholly the same 
as those used in meridian observations. Now all these give a consistent shape 
to the moon's limb referred to its centre of mass. This shape agrees qualita- 
tively with that which may be deduced from Franz's figure. 

I throw on the screen two diagrammatic representations * of these irregu- 
larities obtained by Dr. F. Hayn from a long series of actual measures of the 
heights and depths of the lunar formations. The next slide shows the 
systematic character more clearly. It is from a paper by Franz. ^ It does not 
show the character of the heights and depths at the limb, but we may judge 
of these from the general character of the high and low areas of the portions 
which have been measured and which extend near to the limbs. I think there 
can be little doubt that this explanation of these small terms is correct, and if 
so it supplies a satisfactory cause for a number of puzzling inequalities. 

The most interesting feature of this result is the general shape of the 
moon's limb relative to the centre of mass and its relation to the principle of 
isostasy. Here we see with some definiteness that the edge of the southern 
limb in general is further from the moon's centre of mass than the northern. 
Hence we must conclude that the density at least of the crust of the former is 
less than that of the latter, in accordance with the principle mentiQned. The 
analogy to the figure of the earth with its marked land and sea hemispheres is 
perhaps worth pointing out, but the higher ground in the moon is mainly on the 
south of its equator, while that on the earth is north. Unfortunately we know 
nothing about the other face of the moon. Nevertheless it seems worth while 
to direct the attention of geologists to facts which may ultimately liave some

cosmogonic applications. The astronomical difficulties are immediate : different 
corrections for meridian observations in latitude, in longitude, on Mosting A, 
for oecultations and for the photographic method, will be required. 

I next turn to a question, the cliief interest of which is geodetic rather than 
astronomical. I have mentioned that a certain value of the earth's ellipticity 
will make the observed motions of the perigee and node agree with their 
theoretical values. This value is 1/293-7 ±-3. Now Helmert's value obtained 
from gravity determinations is 1/298-3. The conference of ' Nautical Almanac' 
Directors in 1911 adopted 1/297. There is thus a considerable discrepancy. 
Other evidence, however, can be brought forward. Not long ago a series of 
simultaneous observations at the Cape and Greenwich Observatories was made 
in order to obtain a new value of the moon's parallax. After five years' work 
a hundred simultaneous pairs were obtained, the discussion of which give 
evidence of their excellence. Mr. Crommelin, of the Greenwich Observatory, 
who undertook this discussion, determined the ellipticity of the earth by a com- 
parison between the theoretical and observed values of the parallax. He found 
an ellipticity l/294-4±l-5 closely agreeing with that which I have obtained. 
Finally, Col. Clarke's value obtained from geodetic measures was 1/293-5. We 
have thus three quite different determinations ranging round 1/294 to set 
against a fourth determination of 1/298. The term in the latitude of the moon 
which has often been used for this purpose is of little value on account of the 
coefficient being also dependent on the value of the obliquity of the ecliptic ; 
such evidence as it presents is rather in favour of the larger value. I omit 
Hill's value, obtained from gravity determinations, because it is obviously too 
large. 

Here, then, is a definite issue. To satisfy the observations of the moon in at 
least three different parts, a value near 1/294 must be used; while the value 
most carefully found from gravity determinations is 1/298. As far as astronomy 
is concerned, the moon is the only body for which a correct value of this constant 
is important, and it would seem inadvisable to use a value which will cause a 
disagreement between theory and observation in at least three different ways. It 
is a question whether the conference value should not be changed with the 
advent of the new lunar tables. 

In looking forward to future determinations of this constant, it seems to be 
quite possible that direct observations of the moon's parallax are likely to furnish 
at least as accurate a value of the earth's shape as any other method. This can 
be done, I believe, much better by the Harvard photographic method than by 
meridian observations. Two identical instruments are advisable for the best 
results, one placed in the northern and the other in the southern hemisphere from 
60° to 90° apart in latitude and as nearly as possible on the same meridian. On 
nights which are fine at both stations, from fifteen to twenty pairs of plates could 
be obtained. In a few months it is probable that some 400 pairs might be 
obtained. These should furnish a value for the parallax with a probable error 
of about 0"-02 and a value for the ellipticity within .half a unit of the denominator 
294. It would be still more interesting if the two instruments could be set up on 
meridians in different parts of the earth. The Cape and a northern observatory, 
Upsala for example, would furnish one arc ; Harvard and Ariquipa or Santiago 
another. If it were possible to connect by triangulation Australia with the 
Asiatic continent, a third could be obtained near the meridian of Brisbane. Or, 
accepting the observed parallax and the earth's ellipticity, we could find by 
observation the lengths of long arcs on the earth's surface with high accuracy. 

In any case, I believe that the time must shortly come when the photographic 
method of finding the moon's place should be taken up more extensively, whether 
it be used for the determination of the moon's parallax and the earth's ellipticity 
or not. The Greenwich meridian observations have been and continue to be a 
wonderful storehouse for long series of observations of the positions of the sun, 
moon, planets, and stars. In the United States, Harvard Observatory has 
adopted the plan of securing continuous photographic records of the sky with 
particular reference to photometric work. Under Professor Pickering it will 
also continue the photographic record of the moon's position as long as arrange- 
ments can be made to measure the plates and compute the moon's position from 
them. 



318 TRANSACTIOKS OF SECTION A. 

In spite of the fact that Harvard Observatory has undertaken to continue for 
the present the work of photographing the moon's position, I believe that this 
method should find a permanent home in a national observatory. It has already 
shown itself capable of producing the accuracy which the best modern observa- 
tions of Greenwich can furnish, and no higher praise need be given. If this home 
could be found in the southern hemisphere, and more particularly in Australia, 
other advantages would accrue. 

But we should look for more than this. In an observatory whose first duty 
might be the securing of the best daily records of the sky, the positions of the 
sun, stars, planets, a couple of plates of the moon on every night when she is 
visible would be a small matter. What is needed is an organisation so_ con- 
structed as to be out of the reach of changing governmental policy with a 
permanent appropriation and a staff of the highest character removed from all 
political influences. It could render immense service to astronomers, not only in 
the Empire but all over the world. The pride which every Englishman feels who 
has to work with the records of the past furnished by Greenwich would in course 
of time arise from the work of a similar establishment elsewhere. Those of us 
who live in a community which, reckoning by the age of nations, is new, know 
that, in order to achieve objects which are not material, sacrifices must be made; 
but we also knov7 that such sacrifices are beneficial, not only in themselves, but 
as exerting an indirect influence in promoting the cause of higher education and 
of scientific progress in every direction. In saying this I am not advocating the 
cause of the few, but of the majority; the least practical investigations of yester- 
day are continually becoming of the greatest practical value to-day. 

No address before this section is complete without some speculation and a 
glance towards the future. I shall indulge in both to some small extent before 
closing. I have shown you what the outstanding residuals in the moon's motion 
are : they consist mainly of long-period fluctuations in the mean longitude. I 
have not mentioned the secular changes because the evidence for them does not 
rest on modern observations but on ancient eclipses, and these are matters too 
debatable to discuss in the limited time allotted to me for this address. It may 
be said, however, that the only secular motion which is capable of being deter- 
mined from the modern observations and is not affected by the discussion of 
ancient eclipses — namely, the secular motion of the perigee — agrees with its 
theoretical value well within the probable error. With this remark I pass to the 
empirical terms. 

These unexplained differences between theory and observation may be 
separated into two parts. First, Newcomb's term of period between 250 and 300 
years and coefficient 13", and, second, the fluctuations which appear to have an 
approximate period of 60 to 70 years. The former appears to be more important 
than the latter, but from the investigator's point of view it is less so. The force 
depends on the degree of inclination of the curve to the zero line or on the 
curvature, according to the hypothesis made. In either case the shorter period 
term is much more striking, and, as I have pointed out on several occasions, it is 
much more likely to lead to the sources of these terms than the longer period. 
It is also, at least for the last sixty years, much better determined from observa- 
tion, and is not likely to be confounded with unknown secular changes. 

Various hypotheses have been advanced within the last few years to account 
for these terms. Some of them postulate matter not directly observed or matter 
with unknown constants ; others, deviations of the Newtonian law from its 
exact expression ; still others, non-gravitational forces. M. St. Blancat " 
examines a variety of cases of intramercurial planets and arrives at the conclusion 
that such matter, if it exists, must have a mass comparable with that of Mercury. 
Some time ago I examined the same hypothesis and arrived at similar results. 
The smallest planet with density four times that of water, which would produce 
the long inequality, must have a disc of nearly 2" in its transit across the sun 
and a still larger planet would be necessary to produce the shorter period terms. 
But observational attempts, particularly those made by Perrine and Campbell, 
have always failed to detect any such planet, and Professor Campbell is of the 
opinion that a body with so large a disc could hardly have been overlooked. If

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A. 319 

we fall back on a swarm instead of a single body, we replace one difficulty by 
two. The light from such a swarm would bo greater than that from a single 
body, and would therefore make detection more likely. If the swarm were more 
diffused we encounter the difficulty that it would not be held together by its 
own attraction, and would therefore soon scatter into a ring; such a ring 
cannot give periodic changes of the kind required. 

The shading of gravitation by interposing matter, e.g. at the time of 
eclipses, has been examined by Bottlinger.' For one reason alone, I believe this 
is very doubtful. It is difficult to see how new periodicities can be produced ; 
the periods should be combinations of those already present in the moon's 
motion. The sixty to seventy years' fluctuation stands out in this respect 
because its period is not anywhere near any period present in the moon's 
motion or any probable combination of the moon's periods. Indeed 
Dr. Bottlinger's curve shows this : there is no trace of the fluctuation. 

Some four years ago I examined^ a number of hypotheses. The motions of the 
magnetic field of the earth and of postulated fields on the moon had to be 
rejected, mainly because they caused impossible increases in the mean motion 
of the perigee. An equatorial ellipticity of the sim's mass, combined with a 
rotation period very nearly one month in length, appeared to be the best of 
these hypotheses. The obvious objections to it are, first, that such an ellip- 
ticity, small as it can bo (about 1/20,000), is difficult to understand on physical 
grounds, and, second, that the rotation period of the nucleus which might be 
supposed to possess this elliptic shape in the sun's equator is a quantity which 
is so doubtful that it furnishes no help from observation, although the observed 
jjeriods are well within the required limits. Dr. Hale's discovery of the 
magnetic field of the sun is of interest in this connection. Such a field, of 
non-uniform strength, and rotating with the sun, is mathematically exactly 
equivalent to an equatorial ellipticity of the sun's mass, so that the hypothesis 
might stand from the mathematical point of view, the expression of the 
symbols in words being alone different. 

The last-published hypothesis is that of Professor Turner, ^ who assumes 
that the Leonids have finite mass and that a big swarm of them periodically 
disturbs the moon as the orbits of the earth and the swarm intersect. I had 
examined this myself last summer, but rejected it because, although it 
explained the straight line appearance of the curve of fluctuations, one of the 
most important of the changes of direction in this curve was not accounted 
for. We have the further difficulty that continual encounters with the earth 
will spread the swarm along its orbit, so that the swarm with this idea 
should be a late arrival and its periodic effect on the moon's motion of 
diminishing amplitude ; with respect to the latter, the observed amplitude 
seems rather to have increased. 

The main objection to all these ideas consists in the fact that they stand 
alone : there is as yet little or no collateral evidence from other sources. 
The difficulty, in fact, is not that of finding an hypothesis to fit the facts, 
but of selecting one out of many. The last hypothesis which I shall mention 
is one which is less definite than the others, but which does appear to have 
some other evidence in its favour. 

The magnetic forces, mentioned above, were changes in the directions of 
assumed magnetic fields. If we assume changes in the intensities of the fields 
themselves, we avoid the difficulties of altering portions of the moon's motion 
other than that of the mean motion. We know that the earth's magnetic 
field varies and that the sun has such a field, and there is no inherent impro- 
bability in attributing similar fields to the moon and the planets. If we 
assume that variations in the strength of these fields arise in the sun and are 
communicated to the other bodies of the solar system, we should expect fluctua- 
tions having the same period and of the same or opposite phase but differing in 
magnitude. It therefore becomes of interest to search for fluctuations in 
the motions of the planets similar to that found in the moon's orbit. The 
material in available form for this purpose is rather scanty ; it needs to be

a long series of observations reduced on a uniform plan. The best I know 
is in Newcomb's 'Astronomical Constants.' He gives there the material for 
the earth arranged in groups of a few years at a time. The results for 
Mercury, given for another purpose, can also be extracted from the same 
place. For Venus and Mars, Newcomb unfortunately only printed the normal 
equations from which he deduces the constants of the orbit. 

On the screen is shown a slide (see below) which exhibits the results for the 
Earth and Mercury compared with those for the moon. In the uppermost 
curve are reproduced the minor fluctuations of the moon shown earlier ; the 
second curve contains those of the earth's longitude; the third, those of 
Mercury's longitude. [By accident the mean motion correction has been left 
in the Earth curve; the zero line is therefore inclined instead of being

horizontal.] It will be noticed that the scales are diffei'ent and that the 
Earth curve is reversed. In spite of the fact that the probable errors of the 
results in the second and third curves are not much less than their diver- 
gencies from a straight line, I think that the correlation exhibited is of some 
significance. If it is, we have here a force whose period, if period in the 
strict sense it has, is the same as that of the effect : the latter is not then 
a resonance from combination with another period. We must therefore look 
for some kind of a surge spreading through the solar system and affecting 
planets and satellites the same way but to different degrees. 

The lowest curve is an old friend, that of Wolf's sunsj)ot frequency, put 
there, not for that reason, but because the known connection for the last sixty 
years between sunspot frequency and prevalence of magnetic disturbance

eiiiibles us with fair probability to extend tlio latter back iu 1750. Witli sume 
change of jihase the periods of high and low maxima correspond nearly with 
the fluctuations above. The eleven-year oscillation is naturally eliminated 
from the group results for the Earth and Mercury. One might expect it to 
be present in the lunar curve, but owing to its' shorter period we should 
probably not obtain a coefficient of over half-a-second. Notwithstanding this 
fact, it is a valid objection to the hypothesis that there is no evidence of it 
In the moon's motion. Eeasons may exist for this : but until the mechanism 
of the action can be made more definite it is hardly worth while to belabour 
the point. 

The hypothesis presents many difficulties. Even if one is disposed to admit 
provisionally a correlation between the four curves — and this is open to con- 
siderable doubt — it is difficult to understand how, under the electron theory 
of magnetic storms, the motions of moon and planets can be sensibly affected. 
I am perhaps catching at straws in attempting to relate two such different 
phenomena with one another, but when we are in the presence of anomalies 
which show points of resemblance and which lack the property of analysis 
into strict periodic sequences some latitude may be permissible. 

In conclusion, what, it may well be asked, is the future of the lunar theory 
now that the gravitational effects appear to have been considered in such 
detail that further numerical work in the theory is not likely to advance our 
knowledge very materially ? What good purpose is to be served by continuous 
observation of the moon and comparison with the theory ? I believe that the 
answer lies mainly in the investigation of the fluctuations already mentioned. 
I have not referred to other periodic terms which have been found because 
the observational evidence for their real existence rests on foundations much 
less secure. These need to be examined more carefully, and this examination 
must, I think, depend mainly on future observations rather than on the records 
of the past. Only by the greatest care in making the observations and in 
eliminating systematic and other errors from them can these matters be fully 
elucidated. If this can be achieved and if the new theory and tables serve, 
as they should, to eliminate all the known effects of gravitation, we shall 
be in a position to investigate with some confidence the other forces which 
seem to be at work in the solar system and at which we can now only guess. 
A.'isistance should be afforded by observations of the sun and planets, but 
tlie moon is nearest to us and is, chiefly on that account, the best instrument 
for their detection. Doubtless other investigations will arise in tlie future. 
But the solution of the known problems is still to be sought, and the laying 
(if the coping stone on the edifice reared tlirough the last two centuries can- 
not be a simple matter. Even our abler successors will hardly exclaim, with 
Hotspur, 

' By heaven, methinks, it were an easy leap 
To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon.' 

They, like ns and our predecessors, must go through long and careful investi- 
gations to find out the new truths before they have solved our difficulties, and 
in their turn they will discover new problems to solve for (hose who follow

President or the Section. — Professor William J. Pope, M A., 

LL.D., P.E.S. 



Melbouene. 

FBIDAY, AUGUST 14. 

The President delivered the following Address : — 

The British Association has been firmly established as one of the institutions 
of our Empire for more tlian half a century past. The powerful hold which 
it has acquired probably arises from the welcome which every worker in science 
extends to an occasional cessation of his ordinary routine— a respite during 
which the details of the specific inquiry in hand may bo temporarily cast aside, 
and replaced by leisurely discussion with colleagues on the broader issues of 
scientific progress. 

The investigator, continually occupied with his own problems and faced with 
an ever-increasing mass of technical literature, ordinarily finds little time for 
reflection upon tho real meaning of his work; he secures, in general, far too 
I'cw opportunities of considering in a philosophical sort of way the past, present, 
and future of his own particular branch of scientific activity. It is not difficult 
to form a fairly accurate survey of the position to which Chemistry had attained 
a generation ago, perhaps even a few years ago; probably no intellect at 
present existing could pronounce judgment upon the present position of our 
science iu terms which would commend themselves to the historian of the 
twenty-first century. Doubtless even one equipped with a complete knowledge 
of all that lias been achieved, stauding on the very frontier of scientific advance 
and peering into the surrounding darkness, would be quite incompetent to 
make any adequate forecast of the conquests which will be made by chemical 
and physical science during tho next fifty years. At the same time, chemical 
history tells us that progress is tire result in large measure of imperfect attempts 
to appreciate the present and to forecast the future. I therefore propose to lay 
before you a sketch of the present position of certain branches of chemical 
knowledge and to discuss the directions in which progress is to be sought; none 
of us dare cherish the conviction that his views on such matters are correct, but 
everyone desirous of contributing towards the development of his science must 
attempt an appreciation of this kind. The importance to the worker and to 
the subject of free ventilation and discussion of the point of view taken by the 
individual can scarcely be over-estimated. 

The two sciences of Chemistry and Physics were at one time included as 
parts of the larger subject entitled Natural Philosophy, but in the early part 
of the nineteenth century they drew apart. Under the stimulus of Dalton's 
atomic theory, Chemistry developed into a study of the interior of the molecule, 
and, as a result of the complication of the observed phenomena, progressed from 
stage to stage as a closely reasoned mass of observed facts and logical con- 
clusions. Physics, less entangled in its infancy with numbers of experimental 
data which apparently did not admit of quantitative correlation, was developed 
largely as a branch of applied mathematics; such achievements of the formal 



TRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 323 

Physics of the last century as tlie mathematical theory of light and t]ie kinetic 
theory of gases are monuments to the powers of tlie human intellect. 

The path of Chemistry, as an application of iiure logical argument to the 
interpretation of complex masses of observations, thus gradually diverged from 
that taken by Physics as the mathematical treatment of less involved experi- 
mental data, although both subjects derived their impetus to development from 
the speculations of genius. 

It is interesting to note, however, that during recent years the two sciences, 
which were so sharply distinguished twenty years ago as to lead to mutual 
misunderstandings, are now converging. Many purely chemical questions have 
received such full quantitative study that the results are susceptible to attack 
by the methods of the mathematical physicist; on the other hand, the intense 
complication perceived during the fuller examination of many physical problems 
has led to their interpretation by the logical argument of the chemist because 
the traditional mathematical mode of attack of the physicist has proved power- 
less to deal with the intricacies exhibited by the observed facts. 

The progress of Chemistry during the last century has been mainly the result 
of the co-ordination of observed facts in accordance with a series of hypotheses 
each closely related in point of time to the one preceding it. The atomic theory, 
as it was enunciated by Dalton in 180.3, was a great impetus to chemical investi- 
gation, but proved insufficient to embrace all the known facts; it was supple- 
mented in 181.3 by Avogadro's theorem — that equal volumes of gases contain the 
same numbers of molecules at the same temperature and pressui-e. These two 
important theoretical developments led to the association of a definite physical 
meaning with the idea of molecular coviposition, but ultimately proved 
insufficient for the interpretation of the ever-increasing mass of chemical know- 
ledge collected under their stimulus. A further great impetus followed the 
introduction by Frankland and Kekule, in 1852 onwards, of the idea of valency 
and the mode of building up constitutional formulae; the conception of molecular 
constitution thus arose as a refinement on the Daltonian notion of molecular 
composition. In course of time the theoretical scheme once more proved 
insufficient to accommodate the accumulated facts, until, in 1874, van 't Hoff 
and Le Bel demonstrated the all-important part which molecular configuration 
plays in the interpretation of certain classes of phenomena known to the 
organic Chemist. 

During the early days of chemical science — those of Dalton's time and perhaps 
also those of Frankland and Kekule — we can believe that chemical theory may 
have lacked the physical reality which it now seems to us to present; the 
attitude of our predecessors towards the theoretical interpretation of their 
observations was rather that described by Plato : ' as when men in a dark 
cavern judge of external objects by the shadows which they cast into the 
cavern.'' In the writings of the most clear-sighted of our forerunners we can 
detect an underlying suspicion of a possibility that, at some time or other, the 
theory by means of which chemical observations are held together may undergo 
an entire reconstruction; a very few years ago Ostwald made a determined 
attempt to treat our science without the aid of the molecular hypothesis, and 
indeed suggested the desirability of giving the Daltonian atomic theory decent 
burial. 

The last ten years or so has seen a change in this attitude. The development 
of Organic Chemistry has revealed so complete a correspondence between the 
indications of the conception of molecular constitution and configuration and 
the observed facts, and recent work on the existence of the molecule, largely 
in connection with colloids, with radioactivity, and with crystal structure, is so 
free from ambiguity, that persistence of doubt seems unreasonable. _ Probably 
most chemists are prepared to regard the present doctrine of chemical consti- 
tution and configuration as proven; although they may turn a dim vision 
towards the next great development, they have few misgivings as to the stability 
of the position which has already been attained. 

Let us consider how far the study of Organic Cliemistry has hitherto led us ; 
we may pass over the gigantic achievements of those who in past generations 
determined constitution and performed syntheses, thus making the subject 
one of the most perfect examples of scientific classification which exist, and turn

to the question of molecular configuration. In 1815 Biot observed that certain 
liquid organic substances deflect the plane of polarisation of a transmitted ray 
of light either to the right or to the left ; half-a-century later Pasteur and 
Paterno pointed the obvious conclusion, namely, that the right- or left-handed 
deviation thus exerted must be due to a corresponding right- or left-handedness 
in the configuration of the chemical molecule. A scheme representing such right- 
or left-handedness, or enantiomorphism, was first enunciated by van 't Hoff and 
Le Bel upon the basis of the previously established doctrine of chemical con- 
stitution ; briefly stated, the idea suggested was that the methane molecule, CH^, 
was not to be regarded as extended in a plane in the manner represented by the 
Frankland-Kekule constitutional formula, but as built up symmetrically in three- 
dimensional space. The carbon atom of the methane molecule thus occupies the 
centre of a regular tetrahedron, of which the apices are replaced by the four 
hydrogen atoms. A methane derivative, in which one carbon is separately 
attached to four different univalent atoms or radicles of the type CXYZW, 
should thus exist in two enantiomorphous configurations, one exhibiting right- 
and the other left-handedness. The inventors of this daringly mechanistic inter- 
pretation of the far less concrete constitutional formula; were able to interpret 
immediately a large number of known facts, previously incomprehensible, by 
means of their extension of the Frankland-Kekule view of constitution. They 
showed that every substance then known, which in the liquid state exhibited 
so-called optical activity, could be regarded as a derivative of methane in which 
the methane carbon atom was attached to four different univalent atoms or 
groups of atoms ; a methane carbon atom so associated is termed an asymmetric 
carbon atom. It is of interest to note that the van 't Hoff-Le Bel deduction 
resulted from the discussion of the behaviour of organic substances of some 
molecular complexity ; the optically active substances then known were 
mo.stly the products of animal or vegetable life, and among them none occurs 
which contains less than three carbon atoms in the molecule. Lactic acid, 
CH3 . CH(OH) . CO . OH, is practically the most simple optically active sub- 
stance of natural occurrence; it contains twelve atoms in the molecule, and it has 
only recently been found possible to associate optical activity with a much 
more simply constituted substance, namely, chloriodomethanesulphonic acid 
CHCII . SO3H, the molecule of which contains less than 5 per cent, of carbon 
and only nine atoms, four more than the minimum number, five, which 
theoretically can give rise to optical activity.^ 

The working out of the practical consequences of the doctrine of the tetra- 
hedral configuration of the methane carbon atom by von Baeyer, Emil Fischer, 
and Wislicenus is now a matter of ihistory ; the acquisition of masses of experi- 
mental data, broad in principle and minute in detail, placed the van 't Hoff- 
Le Bel hypothesis beyond dispute. The rapid growth of Organic Chemistry as 
a classified subject contrasted strongly with that of Inorganic Chemistry, in 
which the collection of a great variety of detailed knowledge incapable of far- 
reaching logical correlation formed the most striking feature ; in fact, the exten- 
sion of the conclusion, proven in the case of carbon compounds, that the 
Frankland-Kekule constitutional formulae must be translated into terms of three- 
dimensional space, to compounds of elements other than carbon, did not imme- 
diately follow the application of the theory to this element. Twenty years ago, 
indeed, the idea prevailed that carbon compounds differed radically from those 
of other elements, and we were not prepared to transfer theoretical conclusions 
from the organic to the inorganic side of our subject. In 1891, however, Le Bel 
stated that he had found optical activity associated with asymmetry of a 
quinquevalent nitrogen atom ; although the experimental work upon which this 
conclusion was founded is now known to be incorrect,^ the conception thus put 
forward was important, as suggesting that the notion of space-configuration could 
not be restricted logically to methane derivatives. When it was proved in 1899 
that benzylphenylallylmethylammonium iodide could exist in a right- and left- 
handed configuration, it became necessary to admit that the spacial arrangement

PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 325 

The demonstration that optical activity, or enantiomorphism, of molecular con- 
figuration is associated not only with the presence of an asymmetric quadrivalent 
carbon atom, but also with that of a nitrogen atom attached to five different 
radicles, was the result of an improvement of technique in connection with the 
study of optical activity; previously the resolution into optically active compo- 
nents of a potentially optically active basic substance had been attempted with 
the aid of naturally occiirring optically active weak acids of the general type of 
(/-tartaric acid. The application of the strong d- and Z-bromocamphorsulphonic 
acids and the d- and Z-camphorsulphonic acids to such purposes rendered 
possible the isolation of the optically active substances containing no asymmetric 
atom other than one of quinquevalent nitrogen. The resolution of asymmetric 
quaternary ammonium salts of the kind indicated was rapidly followed by the 
preparation of optically active substances in which the enantiomorphism is asso- 
ciated with the presence of an asymmetric sulphur, selenium, tin, phosphorus, or 
silicon atom ; compounds of the following constitutions were thus obtained in 
optically active modifications : —

In all this work, and amongst all the varied classes of optically active com- 
pounds prepared, it was in every instance possible to indicate one particular 
quadrivalent or quinquevalent atom in the molecule which is separately attached 
t(j four or five different atoms or radicles: the enantiomorphism of molecular con- 
figuration may be detected, in fact, by the observation that such an a.symmetric 
atom is present. It must, however, be insisted that the observed optical activity 
is tlio result of the enantiomorphism of the molecular configuration ; tlie asym- 
metry of a particular atom is not to be regarded as the cause of the optical 
activity but merely as a convenient geometrical sign of molecular enantio- 
morphism. In 187-1 van 't Hoff realised that molecular enantiomorphism and 
optical activity might conceivably exist without the presence of an asymmetric 
carbon atom, and suggested that compounds of the type

no carbon atom which is attached to four different groups, but a study of tlie 
solid model representing the molecular configuration built up in accordance with 
the van 't Hoff-Wislicenus conclusions reveals the enantiomorphism. 

It is of some importance to note that the configurations assigned to such 
optically active substances as have been mentioned above, on the basis of the 
experimental evidence, are of as symmetrical a character as the conditions 
permit; the Kekule formula for methane, CH,,, in which all five atoms lie in 
the same plane, is not of so highly symmetrical a character as the van 't Hoff- 
Le Bel configuration in which the four hydrogen atoms are situate at the apices 
of a regular tetrahedron described about the carbon atom as centre. Some 
influence seems to be operative which tends to distribute the component radicles 
in an unsymmetrical molecule in as symmetrical a manner as possible; recent 
work indicates, however, that this is not always true. During the past few 
years Mills and Bain * have shown that the synthetic substapce of the constitution

can be resolved into optically active modifications. The conclusion is thus 
forced upon us that the trivalent nitrogen atom in such compounds is not 
environed in the most symmetrical manner possible by the surrounding com- 
ponents of the molecule; the experimental verification which the conclusions of 
Hantzsch and Werner, concerning the isomerism of the oximes, thus derive, 
constitutes the first really direct evidence justifying their acceptance. 

Quite recently, and by the application largely of the optically active powerful 
sulphonic acids derived from camphor, Werner has made another great advance 
in connection with the subject of optical activity. He has obtained a number 
of complex compounds of chromium, cobalt, iron, and rhodium in optically active 
modifications. 

The foregoing brief statement probably suffices to indicate the progress 
which has been made during the last twenty years in demonstrating that the 
atoms or radicles associated in the chemical molecule do not lie in one plane 
but are disposed about certain constituent atoms in three-dimensional space ; 
careful study of the present stage of progress shows that we must attribute to 
molecular configuration, as determined by modern chemical methods, a very 
real significance. It can no longer be supposed to possess the purely diagram- 
matic character which attached to the Frankland-Kekule constitutional formulae ; 
it seems to be proved that the men who developed the doctrine of valency were 
not merely pursuing an empirical mode of classification, capable of various modes 
of physical interpretation, but were devising the main scheme of a correct 
mechanical model of the chemical universe. 

The development of a branch of science such as that now under discussion 
is, to a considerable extent, an artistic pursuit; it calls for the exercise of 
manipulative skill, of a knowledge of materials, and of originality of conception, 
which probably originate in intuition and empiricism, but must be applied with 
scientific acumen and logical judgment. For reasons of this kind many gaps 
occur in our present knowledge of the subject; although so many important 
conclusions find an unshakable foundation on facts relating to optical activity, 
we have as yet no clear idea as to why substances of enantiomorphous molecular 
configuration exhibit optical activity. Great masses of quantitative data 
referring to optical activity have been accumulated; something has been done 
towards their correlation by Armstrong, Frankland, Pidcard, Lowry, and 
others, but we still await from the mathematical physicist a theory of optical 
activity comparable in quantitative completeness to the electro-magnetic theory 
of light. Until we get such a theory it seems unlikely that much further 
progress will be made in interpreting quantitative determinations of rotation 
constants. 

That aspect of stereochemistry which has just been so briefly reviewed 
represents a .situation which has been attained during the natural development 

■Trans. Chem. Soc, 1910, 97, 18G0. 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 327 

of Organic Chemistry by methods which have now become traditional ; progress 
has been made by the application of slrictly logical methods of interpretation 
to masses of experimental data, and each new conclusion has been checked and 
verified by the accumulation of fresh contributions in the laboratory. The 
snreness of the methods adopted could not fail to lead to the intrusion of 
stereochemistry into adjacent fields of scientific activity; bio-chemistry, the 
study of the chemical processes occurring in living organisms, is already largely 
dominated by stereochemistry, and the certainty with which stereochemistry has 
inspired ns as to the reality of the molecular constitution of matter is exerting 
a powerful influence in other branches of natural science. Quite possibly, 
however, the acquaintance which every chemist possesses of the great progress 
already made upon one particular set of lines is to some extent an obstacle 
to liis appreciation of new directions in which further great stereochemical 
advances may be anticipated. 

A little reflection will show that the study of the relation between the 
crystalline form and chemical constitution or configuration of substances in 
general may confidently be expected to lead to important extensions of our 
knowledge of tlie manner in which the atoms are arranged in molecular com- 
plexes. The earlier ci'ystallographic work of the nineteenth century led to the 
conclusion that each substance affects some particular crystalline form, that the 
regular external crystalline shape is an expression of the internal stiucturo of 
tlie crystal, and that a determination of the simpler properties — geometrical, 
optical, and the like — of a crystalline material constitutes a mode ol^ com])lctely 
characterising the substance. Later work during the last century demonstrated 
tliat the properties of crystalline substances are in entire harmony with a simple 
assiimjition as to tlie manner in which the units or particles of the material 
are arranged ; the assumption is that the arrangement is a geometrically 
' homogeneous ' one, namely, an arrangement in which similar units are uni- 
formly repeated throughout the structure, corresponding points presenting every- 
where a similar environment. The assumption of homogeneity of structure 
imposes a definite limitation upon the kinds of arrangement which are possible 
in crystals; it leads to the inquiry as to how many types of homogeneous 
arrangement of points in space are possible, and to the identification of these 
types with the known classes of crystal symmetry. The final conclusion has 
been attained that there are 230 geometrically homogeneous modes of distributing 
units, or points representing material particles, throughout space; these, the 
so-called 230 homogeneous ' point-systems.' fall into the thirty-two types of 
.symmetry exhibited by crystalline solids. The solution of the purely geometrical 
problem here involved was commenced by Frankenheim in 1830, and finally 
completed by Barlow in 1894; it brings us face to face with the much larger 
stereochemical problem — that of determining what the units are which become 
homogeneously arranged in the crystal, why they become so arranged, and in 
what way a connection can be established between chemical constitution and 
crystal structure. 

Since the conception of homogeneity of structure alone is clearly insufficient 
for the interpretation of the more advanced problem, some further assumption 
mu.st be made as a foundation for any really comprehensive attempt to collate 
the quantities of isolated facts bearing upon the subject. Of the many assump- 
tions which have been made in this connection only one, which may now be 
stated, has as yet proved fruitful in the sense that it serves to correlate large 
numbers of known experimental facts, and that it indicates the way to the 
discovery of fresh facts. The assumi^tion is that each atom in a crystalline 
structure acts as a centre of operation of two opposing forces : [a) a repellent 
force, attributable to the kinetic energy of the atom, and {b) an attractive 
force, both forces, like gravity, being governed by some inverse distance law. 
Such an assumption forms an essential part of the classical work of Clerk 
Maxwell and van der Waals on the kinetic theory of gases and liquids. Its 
application to solid crystalline substances, where it must be applied in con- 
junction with the principle of structural homogeneity, was made by Barlow 
and myself in 1906. 

The operation of the assumption just stated is readily visualised by con- 
sidering the simplest possible case, that, namely, of a crystalline element each 



o: 



are 



28 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B. 

molecule of which consists of but one atom and in wliich all the atoms .1 
similar. Consideration of this kind of case shows that the set of identically 
similar centres of attracting and opposing forces will be in equilibrium when 
one particular simple condition is fulfilled ; the condition is that, with a given 
density of packing of the centres, the distance separating nearest centres is a 
maximum. Two homogeneous arrangements of points fulfil this condition, and 
these exhibit the symmetry of the cubic and the hexagonal crystalline systems. 

Since the nature of the two arrangements of points is not easily realised by 
mere inspection, the systems must be presented in some alternative form for 
the purpose of more clearly demonstrating their properties; this is done con- 
veniently by imagining each point in either arrangement to swell as a sphere 
until contact is made with the neighbouring points. The two arrangements then 
become those shown in Figs. 1 and 2, and are distinguished as the cubic and 
the hexagonal closest-packed assemblages of equal spheres; they differ from 
all other homogeneous arrangements in presenting maximum closeness of packing 
of the component spheres. The equilibrium condition previously remarked — 
that, with a given density of distribution of the force centres "in space, the 
distance separating nearest centres is a maximum — is revealed in the assemblages 
of spheres as the condition that the spheres are arranged with the maximum 
closeness of packing. 

A further step is yet necessary. Each point in the arrangements considered 
is regarded as the mean centre of an atom of the crystalline element, but the 
assumption originally made states nothing about the magnitude of the atom 
itself ; it is therefore convenient to regard the whole of the available space as 
filled by the atoms, without interstices. This is conveniently done by imagininiT; 
tangent planes drawn at each contact of sphere witK sphere, so partitioning 
the available space into plane-sided polyhedra, each of which may be described 
as the domain of one component atom. The twelve-sided polyhedra thus 
derived from the cubic and the hexagonal assemblages represent the solid areas 
throughout which each atom exercises a predominant influence in establishing 
the equilibrium arrangement. 

The two assemblages can now be described in a quantitative manner by 
stating the symmetry and also the relative dimensions of each. The cubic 
assemblage exhibits symmetry identical with that of the cube or the regular 
octahedron, a symmetry characteristic of so-called holohedral cubic crystals ; 
the relative dimensions in different directions are defined by the symmetry. 
The assemblage can, in fact, be referred to three axes parallel to the edges of a 
cube, and as these directions are obviously similar in a cube, their ratios are of the 
form, a : b : c = l : 1:1. Tliis expression indicates that if the assemblage, sup- 
posed indefinitely extended through space, is moved by a unit distance in either 
of the three rectangular directions a, b, and c, the effect, as examined from any 
jioint, is as if the assemblage had not been moved at all. 

The symmetry of the hexagonal assemblage is identical with that of a 
liexagonal prism or of a double hexagonal pyramid, and is that characteristic 
of the so-called holohedral, hexagonal, crystalline system ; the relative dimen- 
sions are no longer defined entirely by the symmetry, and are conveniently stated 
as the ratio of the diameter, a, of the prism or pyramid, to the height, c, of 
the pyramid. The ratio, a : c, for the assemblage of spheres under discussion 
can be calculated ; it assumes two forms, corresponding to two modes of selecting 
alternative principal diameters of the prism as unit. The alternative ratios are : 

a : c = l : 1-6330 or a : c = l : 1-4142. 

This somewhat lengthy theoretical discussion has now reached a stage at 
which it can be applied to the observed facts; the accompanying table (Table I.) 
states the mode in which crystalline substances of different degrees of molecular 
complexity distribute themselves amongst the various crystal systems. Of the 
elements which have been crystallographically examined, 50 per cent, are cubic, 
whilst a further 35 per cent, are hexagonal : and consideration of the data for 
these latter shows that they exhibit approximately the axial ratios characteristic of 
the hexagonal closest-packed assemblage; thus magnesium shows a : c = l : 1-6242, 
and arsenic the ratio a : c = l : 1-4025.

Whilst the crystal structure of some 85 per cent, of the crystalline elements 
seems to be in general agreement with the simple assumption of equilibrium 
which has been made, the divergence presented by about 15 per cent, of the 
elements still awaits explanation. The previous discussion applies to the 
theoretically simple case of a monoatomic element; many of the elements are, 
however, certainly polyatomic. Imagine, therefore, that in the crystal structure, 
agreeing with the cubic or hexagonal arrangement just described, the similar 
atoms are grouped to form complex molecules, each containing two or more 
atoms ; the geometrical effect of this grouping, if any, should be, first, to 
degrade the symmetry of the structure, and, secondly, to slightly alter its 
relative dimensions. It would therefore be expected that if the elements which 
are neither cubic nor hexagonal owe their departure from those systems to 
molecular aggregation, the crystal dimensions should approximate closely to those 
of the two ideal assemblages ; this is, indeed, found to be the case. Monosymmetric 
sulphur, for instance, exhibits the axial ratios, rt : i : c = 0-9958 : 1 : 0-9988, 
/? = 95° 46'; the relative dimensions in the three directions, a, b, and c, are 
almost the same as in the cubic system, and the angle between the directions 
a and c is ^6 = 95° 46', instead of 90°. This substance has nearly the dimensions 
of a cubic crystal, and is obviously ' pseudo-cubic ' ; the same is true of all other 
elements which depart from true cubic or hexagonal symmetry. 

The crystalline forms presented by the elements are consequently in accordance 
with the assumption that the crystal structures are equilibrium arrangements of 
the component atoms of the two kinds described. It is also indicated that 
aggregation of the atoms to form molecular complexes is responsible for the 
departure from simple cubic or hexagonal symmetry; in this connection it is 
interesting to note that the strongly coloured elements depart most widely from 
these two systems. Thus, the colourless modifications of carbon and phosphorus 
are cubic, whilst the black graphite is monosymmetric and the red phosphorus is 
orthorhombic in crystal form ; this is in accordance with the general view that 
colour is the result of some particular kind of molecular aggregation. 

Although so much general correspondence of a quantitative character is to be 
observed between the observed facts and the anticipations developed from the 
equilibrium assumption, it has become evident during the last year or two that 
the conception formed as to the nature of the equilibrium which determines the 
arrangement of the atoms in a crystalline element is of too simple a character. 
In 1912 Laue showed that on passing a narrow pencil of X-rays through a crystal 
plate the emergent rays were capable of forming a regular, geometrical pattern of 
spots upon a photographic plate placed to receive the emergent beam ; the pattern 
of spots thus produced was in agreement with the symmetry of the direction in 
the crystal plate in which the beam was passed. This discovery was developed 
and very considerably extended by Bragg, who was able to show that an X-ray 



330 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B. 

beam undergoes reflection at the surface of a crystal plate. The interpretation 
of the novel results indicates that the homogeneous crystal structure acts upon 
the X-ray beam much as a solid diffraction grating might be expected to do, and 
that each deflected transmitted ray is a reflection from one set of parallel planes 
of atoms in the crystal. 

The experimental and theoretical study of the X-ray effects has been prose- 
cuted with brilliant success by W. H. and" VV. L. Bragg, the result being that a 
method is now available which makes it possible to determine, with very great 
probability, the actual arrangement of the constituent atoms in crystal structure. 
Sufficient time has not yet elapsed for the thorough exploitation of this new 
and fruitful field of research, but many data are available already for com- 
parison with the conclusions drawn from the consideration of the equilibria 
possible in crj'stal structures ; it is found that the two methods do not at once lead 
to identical conclusions. Thus, in accordance with the first method, the structure 
of the diamond would be indicated as some slight modification of the cubic 
closest-packed assemblage of equal spheres, the modification consisting in the 
main of a grouping of sets of atoms which leads to the partial cubic symmetry 
which the diamond apparently exhibits ; one particular mode of grouping which 
leads to the required result consists in supposing the carbon atoms formed into 
sets of four, tetrahedrally arranged, two oppositely orientated sets of .such tetra- 
hedral groups being distinguished. If each of these tetrahedral groups be 
replaced by a single point situated at the group-centre, the structure which the 
Bragg experiments indicate for the diamond is obtained. 

The simple geometrical relationship which thus exists between the two sug- 
gested structures for diamond raises a suspicion that the particular form in which 
the assumption of equilibrium is stated requires qualification : that possibly the 
domain of the carbon atom when packed with others, as in the diamond, does 
not become converted into a rhombic dodecahedron, but into a polyhedron roughly 
tetrahedral in shape. 

Leaving this particular point for the moment and turning again to Table T., 
it is seen that the binary compounds, like the elements, also tend to crystallise in 
the cubic or hexagonal systems ; the axial ratios of the hexagonal binary com- 
pounds approximate very closely to the value, a : c — 1 :1'6330, calculated for the 
closest-packed, hexagonal assemblage of equal spheres. The values of c/a for 
all the known cases are : BeO-1-6365, ZnO-1-6077, ZnS-1-6350, CdS-1-6218, 
and Agl- 1-6392. 

Assemblages representing the crystal structures of the cubic and hexagonal 
binary compounds may be derived from the two closest-packed assemblages of 
similar spheres already described, by homogeneously replacing one half of the 
spheres by different ones of the same size. The degrees of symmetry presented 
by these arrangements are not so high as those of the unsubstituted assemblages; 
this is in accordance with the fact that the crystals themselves have not the full 
.symmetry of the holohedral cubic or hexagonal system. Thus, on warming a 
hexagonal crystal of silver iodide, one end of the principal axis c becomes 
positivelj', and the other negatively, electrified. The axis c is thus a polar axis, 
having different properties at its two ends; this axis will be found to be polar in 
the model. Again, when hexagonal silver iodide is heated to 145°, it changes 
its crystalline form and becomes cubic ; this so-called polymorphous change can 
be imitated in the hexagonal model by slightly shifting each pair of layers of 
spheres in the assemblage. 

A very close agreement thus exists between the properties of the assemblages 
deduced and the observed properties of those binary compounds which crystallise 
in the cubic or hexagonal systems. The remaining 12 per cent, or so are not, in 
general, pseudo-cubic or pseudo-hexagonal, and it is noteworthy that they com- 
prise those binary compounds in which the two component elements have not the 
same lowest valency ; amongst them arc the substances of the compositions, 
PbO, FeAs, HgO, AsS, and CuO. 

On comparing the structures of the binai-y crystalline compounds indicated by 
the foregoing method of consideration with those deduced by the Braggs, dis- 
crepancies are again obvious ; again, however, the former assemblage is converted 
into the latter by replacing groups of spheres by their group-centres. The rela- 
tion thus rendered apparent is once more a suggestion that the type of equilibrium 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 331 

conditions originally assumed is too simple. It will be seen, however, tliat 
the Bragg results furnish a proof of one part of the assumption made concerning 
equilibrium, namely, that each component atom operates separately; the dis- 
cussion of the properties of crystals on the assumption that the crystal structure 
may be regarded as built up of similar mass-points, due to the mathematical 
physicists of the last century, therefore requires to be reopened. Thus, the 
Bragg structure of rock-salt is represented by dividing space into equal cubes by 
three sets of parallel planes and replacing the cube corners encountered along the 
directions of the cube edges by chlorine and sodium atoms alternately ; each 
chlorine atom then has six sodium atoms as its nearest and equally distant neigh- 
bours. With which of the latter the one chlorine atom is associated to form a 
molecule of sodium chloride is not apparent from the nature of the crystal 
structure. 

Time need not be now occupied with the further discussion of the crystalline 
structure of simple substances ; until the discovery of the X-ray effects thus 
briefly described, no direct method of determining those structures was available, 
and, in view of the paucity of the experimental data, only the possibilities of 
arrangement could be considered in the light of the Barlow-Pope mode of treat- 
ment. It will, however, be useful to review some of the results which accrue 
from this latter method of regarding the problem of crystal structure in general. 

Taking the general standpoint, which is also in accordance with the Bragg 
results, that each component atom of a crystalline structure has a separate 
spacial existence, and premising that the atomic domains are close-packed in the 
assemblage in accordance with some particular type of equilibrium law, it 
becomes obvious that crystalline structure presents a volume problem. The law 
arrived at after a careful investigation of the subject — the so-called law of 
valency volumes — states that in a crystalline sti-ucture, the component atoms 
occupy domains approximately proportional in volume to the numbers represent- 
ing the fundamental valencies of the elements concerned ; the student of the 
subject of molecular volumes will hardly accept this conclusion without con- 
vincing evidence of its correctness — it indicates, for instance, that in crystalline 
potassium sulphate, if the atomic volume of potassium is taken as miity, those of 
sulphur and oxygen each have the value two. Many different lines of crystal- 
lograpliic argument converge, however, to this law, and, if the latter is in the 
end found to be incorrect, it at least represents something fundamental which still 
awaits enunciation in a more generally acceptable form. A few illustrative 
instances may be quoted. 

If valency be a volume property, the relation should be revealed in the 
compositions of chemical substances, especially those of composite character. 
The sum of the valencies in potassium sulphate, K^SO.,, is 12, and in ammonium 
sulphate, (NHJ.SO^, 24, just twice the number; the two substances are so closely 
related that they crystallise together to form ' solid solutions ' (isomorphous 
mixtures). Similarly, in the alums, such as K,SO,-|-AJ,(SO,,)3-t-24H,0, the 
valencies are 12H-36-f96; the sum of the valencies of the water present, 96, is 
just twice that, 48, of those exhibited by the metallic sulphates. Similar 
curious numerical relationships occur in each of the well-defined series of double 
salts. 

Again, if the valency volume law hold for two substances of different crystal- 
line form, such as orthorhombic rubidium nitrate, RbNO^, and rhombohedral 
sodium nitrate, NaNOj, the metal, the nitrogen and the oxygen in each com- 
pound sliould have the respective atomic volumes, 1, 3, and 2. As the sub- 
stances differ in density the absolute values of the atomic volumes of nitrogen and 
oxygen will differ in the two substances as examined at the same temperature ; 
the ratios of the atomic volumes in either compound should, however, be as 
stated. Considering this conclusion in conjunction with the fact that these 
crystalline compounds represent symmetrically constructed assemblages, it would 
seem that the relative dimensions of the one crystal structure should be traceable 
in those of the other. Orthorhombic rubidium nitrate exhibits the axial ratios, 
a : h : c = l'7336 : 1 : 0-710G, three rectangular co-ordinates, a, b, and c, being 
used as the directions of reference; rhombohedral sodium nitrate exhibits 
n : c=\ : 08276, the co-ordinates being three axes, a, making angles of 120° in 
one plane, and a fourth axis c, perpendicular to a. On converting the axial 



332 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B. 

system of sodium nitrate into a simple set of rectangular axes similar to those 
used for rubidium nitrate, the value, a : c = l : 0-8276, becomes 

G: 6 : c= 1-7320: 1:0-7151. 

These values approximate very closely to those obtained by direct measure- 
ment of the orthorhombic rubidium salt. It seems difficult to avoid the con- 
clusion that the two dissimilar crystalline structures are built up by the arrange- 
ment of layers or blocks of the same relative dimensions in two different ways, 
the molecule of sodium nitrate, NaNOj, possessing practically the same relative 
dimensions as that of rubidium nitrate, RbNO^ ; this, of course, is in disaccord 
with the classic conception of atomic volume, but agrees entirely with the valency 
volume law. 

Another remarkable body of evidence is found in the interpretation of many 
morphotropic relationships between organic and inorganic substances which have 
been long recognised but have hitherto eluded interpretation. The description 
of one or two cases will make the bearing of the law of valency volumes clear in 
this connection.

The ratio cjb is approximately the same in the two cases and general 
similarity exists between the two crystalline substances. It will be observed 
that the values of a/6 are very nearly in the ratio of the sums of the valencies, 
W, making up the two molecular complexes, namely, 60:74 = 100:123. This 
and similar cases may be more conveniently discussed with the aid of the so- 
called equivalence parameters; these are the edge lengths, x, y, and z, of a 
parallelepipedon of which the volume is W, the sum of the valencies in the 
molecule, and of which the linear and angular dimensions express the crystal- 
lographic axial ratios. Thus, for orthorhombic substance, xyz = W, and 
X : y : z=a -.b-.c; the equivalence parameters of the two substances under dis- 
cussion are given in the table, and it will be seen that whilst y and 2 are almost 
identical for the two, the z values differ considerably. This correspondence 
indicates clearly that in passing from camphoric anhydride to the acetone com- 
pound of the acid the mass added to the molecular complex, H„0-|-l/2 (CH3)2C0, 
occupies a volume proportional to the number of valency units which it 
contributes to the structure. 

A very remarkable relation has been long recognised between the crystalline 
forms of the three minerals chondrodite, Mg,,(SiOJ„, 2Mg(F,0H), humite, 
Mg-,(SiO,)„ 2Mg(F,0H), and clinohumite, Mg,(SiOJ,,, 2Mg(F,0H) ; the crystal- 
line forms are referable to three rectangular directions, a, b, and c, and the 
ratio a : 6 is practically the same for all three minerals. The relationship is at 
once elucidated by the law of valency volumes in a simple manner. In the 
molecules of the three substances the sums of the valencies of the constituent 
atoms are respectively 34, 48, and 62 ; it follows from the law that these numbers 
arc proportional to the relative volumes of the several molecules. The ratios, 
(I : b : c, being known, the dimensions can be calculated of solid rectangular 
blocks having these volumes and having edge lengths j)roportional to the axial 
ratios, a : b : c. The equivalence parameters, x, y, and z, thus calculated are 
H'iven in Table III. ; the fir.st observation of importance to be made is that the 
c&lt;(uivalence parameters, x and y, remain practically constant throughout tlic 
scries of three minerals. 

It will be seen that ohojidrodite and humite, .'uul humite and clinohumite, 
differ in molecular tomposition by the quantity, Mg,(SiO,) : tlicy foiiii a series

is left. This is the composition of the mineral prolectite, and the increment, 
MgjfSiOj), is the composition of the mineral forsterite. 

If the law of valency volumes be correct the equivalence parameters of 
forsterite should be the a; and y of the first three minerals, and a value z which 
is the difference between the s values of chondrodite and humite, or of humite 
and clinohumite; furtlier, prolectite should have x and y values identical with 
those of the other four minerals and a z value which is the difference of the 
z values of chondrodite and forsterite. It is thus possible to calculate the 
equivalence parameters of forsterite and prolectite without u.sing data deter- 
mined on these two minerals, and to compare the values so obtained with those 
calculated from the observed axial ratios of forsterite and prolectite. All the 
values referred to are given in Table III., and it will be obvious that the agree- 
ment between the calculated and the observed equivalence parameters is very- 
close ; as this agreement could not occur without the operation of the law of 
valency volumes, which was deduced from entirely different data, strong con- 
firmation of the accuracy of the law is provided.

The several illustrations of the operation of the law of valency volumes have 
been quoted in detail for the purpose of showing how difficult it is to avoid the 
conclusion that this deduction represents some physical reality. It may be 
traced in ^ onnection with quantitative data of other kinds ; during the last 
few years it has been very successfully applied by Le Bas to the interpretation of 
the molecular volumes of liquid substances. 

From what has been already said it will be seen that the great problem as 
to the relation between crystal structure and chemical constitution, of which 
the solution seems imminent, is a stereochemical one ; assemblages must be built 
up in accordance with the principle of homogeneity and in some form of close- 
packing, in which each component atom of a chemical molecule is represented 
as the sole occupant of some specific solid area. The properties of these 
assemblages must also be in agreement with tlie crystallographic measurements 
and the X-ray photographs yielded by the substances represented. 

A brief indication may be given of what has been already effected in this 
connection. The normal paraflSn hydrocarbons of the general composition 
CnHan+'j consist of a chain of the composition (CH2)n, to each end of which 
one hydrogen atom is attached ; in accordance with the principles already 
indicated, a close-packed assemblage of the empirical composition CH, can be 
constructed from carbon and hydrogen spheres of the respective volumes 4 and 
1, of such a nature that it can be divided by planes into blocks, each made 
up of strings of the composition (CH„)n, or .CH, .CH, .... CH. . CH,. At each 
plane of cleavage of the assemblage hydrogen spheres can be inserted in appro- 
priate numbers so tliat close-packing is restored when the cleavage faces are 
brought together again; the assemblage will then have the composition 
H . (CH.,)n . H, and may be geometrically partitioned into units each representing 
one molecular complex of a normal paraflin. It is noteworthy that these units 
exhibit the configurations indicated by the van 't Hoff-Le Bel conception for 
the normal paraffins. Other assemblages can be constructed which represent 
in a similar manner the secondary and tertiary paraffins, and all these 
assemblages are of one particular geometrical type, that which corresponds to 
the chemical behaviour characteristic of the paraffins. In these as.semblages 



331 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION U. 

replacements may be effected so as to introduce new geometrical features of 
arrangement corresponding to the i)resence in the molecule of an ethylenic or 
an acetylenic bond, and thus other classes of hydrocarbons can be represented 
in accordance with the conception of close-packing; the process can he extended 
to the polymethylene and aromatic hydrocarbons and to their substitution 
derivatives, and throughout a close correspondence is observed between the 
numbers of isomerides possible, with their constitutions and configurations, and 
the experimental facts. 

Many considerations indicate the fruitfulness of the mode of regarding 
organic substances just briefly sketched; one may be more particularly specified. 
An assemblage representative of benzene has been suggested which accords with 
the crystalline form and chemical properties of the hydrocarbon, and can be 
geometrically partitioned into units, each representing a single molecule. The 
equivalence parameters of the substance are 

x:y: 2 = 3-101 : 3-480 : 2-780. 

The dimension y is twice the diameter of a carbon sphere, and that of z slightly 
less than the sum of the diameters of a carbon and a hydrogen sphere. Now 
a dimension approximating closely to the z value for benzene can be found 
amongst the equivalence parameters of large numbers of aromatic compounds, 
indicating that in these crystalline substances the benzene complexes are stacked 
one upon the other so as to preserve the z dimension, but that the columns so 
formed are pushed apart in the derivatives to an extent sufficient to admit of 
the entrance, in close-packing, of the substituting radicles. A few cases of 
this kind were quoted by Barlow and myself, and many others were discovered 
by Jerusalem ; ^ quite recently the subject has been subjected to a very thorough 
quantitative examination by Armstrong, Colgate, and Rodd.' The exhaustive 
nature of the experimental work of these latter authors and the care with which 
their conclusions are drawn leave little room for doubt as to the accuracy 
of their main contention, namely, that the crystallographic method affords 
material from which the stereochemical configurations of aromatic substances 
can be deduced. 

If crystallography is to be used as a tool in the service of stereochemistry 
in anything like the way which has been briefly sketched in this address, a 
number of important results should accrue. We have seen that in the structure 
assigned to rock-salt, each sodium atom is identically related to six chlorine 
atoms ; only when the crystal is disintegrated by solution in water does the 
necessity arise for a choice to be made, the sodium atom then selecting one 
particular chlorine atom as a mate. Even then the sodium chloride molecule 
present in solution appears to spend the greater part of its time in dissociation, 
namely, in the act of changing its partner. There is thus in the theory of 
crystal structure something which bears a superficial relationship to electrolytic 
dissociation, and the further study of this aspect of the subject may be fruitful. 

Again, the solid crystalline structures which we have attempted to build 
up present, as one essential feature, the property that they can be partitioned 
geometrically into unit cells, each composed of one molecule of the substance ; 
thus, the rock-salt structure can be partitioned into cells each representing the 
molecule NaCl. In this instance, the partitioning can be performed in a variety 
of ways corresponding to the allocation of one particular sodium atom to 
either of six chlorine atoms; the alternative modes of partitioning lead to the 
production of molecular units of' identical configuration. In many cases, how- 
ever, alternative methods of geometrically partitioning the assemblage represent- 
ing the crystalline structure do not yield units of the same configuration; thus, 
the assemblage representing phloxoglucinol can be geometrically partitioned in 
two distinct ways. Each of these gives a unit of the composition C(;H|,0„ but 
the configuration of the unit of the one partitioning corresponds to the chemical 
structure of the 1:3: 5-trihydroxybenzene,

whilst tho other exhibits the structure of the symmetrical triketohexamethylene, 

SCO . CH./" 

A new suggestion is thus made to the effect that tautomerism consists in the 
possibility of geometrically partitioning the close-packed assemblage in two or 
more alternative ways, each giving molecular units of the same composition but 
of different constitutions. The idea that in the occurrence of tautomerism 
some component atom wanders from one position to another in the molecule 
is thus rejected; the change in constitution arises from the transference of atoms 
as between two or more molecules. As the older conceptions of the mechanism 
of tautomerism do not provide a satisfactory explanation of the experimental 
facts, the suggestion now made is perhaps worthy of consideration. 

The new line of work has many bearings upon the subject of chemical change; 
thus, tho assemblage which is assigned to acetylene (or methylacetylene) is con- 
vertible, by synmietrical distortion, into that representing benzene (or the 
1:3: 5-trimcthylbenzeue, mesitylene). Further, the great change in chemical 
behaviour which accompanies many types of chemical substitution is possibly 
connected with the manner in which the actual atomic volumes are affected by 
the replacement; on converting benaene, in which the atomic volumes of carbon 
and hydrogen are as 4:1, into bromobenzene, a considerable increase in 
molecular volume occurs. The atomic volumes of carbon and hydrogen still, 
presumably, preserve the 4 : 1 ratio, and the volume appropriated by the entering 
bromine atom is approximately the same as that occupied by each hydrogen 
atom already present; the actual atomic volumes of carbon and hydrogen must 
thus be supposed to have increased during the production of bromobenzene. It 
can hardly be supposed that this fundamental volume change, even apart from 
a distortion of the aromatic ring arising from slight inequality of hydrogen and 
bromine atomic domains in the molecule, could occur without the exhibition 
of considerable differences in chemical properties as between benzene and 
bromobenzene. 

Whatever view may bo taken as to the accuracy of the conclusions concerning 
the relation between crystal structure and chemical constitution which are 
briefly discussed in the present Address, no critic will be disposed to doubt 
that wide developments in chemical science will result from the cultivation of 
crystal study ; it seems clear that any satisfactory theory of the solid state 
nmst be largely crystallographic in character. The chief hindrance to progress 
at present consists in the lack of chemists trained in modern crystallograpliic 
niethods ; in my own comitry tho only school in which chemical students were 
trained in Crystallography, dissociated from Mineralogy, was founded by 
Dr. Henry E. Armstrong and Sir Henry A. Miers in 1886. After doing a vast 
amount of valuable educational work this school has recently been allowed 
to become extinct. 

In a Presidential Address to the Mineralogical Society in 1888, Mr. Lazarus 
Fletcher remarked that ' a knowledge of the elements of Crystallography, includ- 
ing the mechanics of crystal measurements, ought to be made a sine qua non for 
a degree in Chemistry at every University.' Twenty-five years later we find 
that no European University has applied this principle, and in consequence the 
chemical crystallographer has the greatest difficulty in making himself intelligible 
to his purely chemical colleagues. May I, in concluding, express the hope that 
the Colonial Universities, less fettered by tradition than their older sisters, may 
lead in the work of placing the subject of crystal structure in its legitimate 
position as one of the most important branches of modern Physical Chemistry ?

1. Residual Affinity and Co-ordination. By Professor Gilbert T. 
MoEGAN and Henry Webster Moss. 

The molecular structures now known as co-ordination compomids owe their 
.stability not merely to the forces (principal valency and residual affinity) 



336 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B. 

eniaiialing from the central atom, but also to the mutual attractions exerted on 
one another by the co-ordinating or associating radicals or groups. It is pre- 
cisely those radicals or groups possessing considerable residual affinity which 
function most frequently in the formation of co-ordinated complexes. The 
general tendency to form hydrated and ammoniated metallic salts is to be 
attributed in the main to the capacity for association exhibited by water and 
ammonia molecules respectively. 

The phenomenon of co-ordination may be compared with the formation of fog 
in moist air containing minute dust-particles, and it is even more closely akin to 
the formation of the large ions of the atmosphere by the association of small 
ions with uncharged invisible water-drops. 

The size of the atomic volume of the central element has a threefold influ- 
ence on the stability of co-ordination compounds. First, if the atomic volume 
is small, the residual affinity of the atom is exerted 'in a more concentrated 
form. Secondly, the co-ordinating molecules or radicals can approach nearer 
to the centre of the central atom when its volume is small and therefore nearer 
to one another so that their mutual attractions become more effective. Thirdly, 
as the dimens'ions of the co-ordinating molecules or radicals are of molecular or 
atomic magnitude, these segregating units will fill more completely the available 
space round an atom of small volume than that round an atom occupying a 
larger sphere. This filling up of the available space also conduces to stability, 
as is manifested by many stereoisomeric compounds. 

The number and arrangement of the associating units have also an important 
bearing on the stability of the co-ordination complex. It is obvious that the 
most stable system will be that in which there is a symmetrical distribution of 
the forces interacting between the associating units, a condition which is 
attained by taking such a number of units that they can be arranged .symmetri- 
cally over the surface of a sphere. This problem has but few solutions, inas- 
much as there are only five regular solids, the tetrahedron, octahedron, cube, 
icosahedron, and dodecahedron, with four, six, eight, twelve, and twenty vertices 
re.spectively. These integers will be the co-ordination numbers corresponding 
with the theoretically possible most stable systems. Molecular aggregations exist 
corresponding with four of these arrangements — that is, with all possible cases 
except that of the dodecahedron. There are also examples of less symmetric 
arrangements which become stable in certain circumstances. 

In addition to the centric co-ordination complexes with associating units 
arranged round a central atom, it is highly probable that co-ordination some- 
times leads to cyclic arrangements, as, for example, in the following instances :■ — 
The basic glucinuni acetate, butyrate, &amp;c., the dichloride and dibromide of 
molybdenum, and the reduction products of the pentahalides of columbium and 
tantalum. 

As an example of the application of the co-ordination theory to compounds 
of technical importance may be cited the case of the lakes of acidic colouring- 
matters developed in mordant dyeing. The simplest of these are the iron, 
chromium, and cobalt lakes of the o;-^/(o-quinoneoximc dyes, which are 
undoubtedly internally co-ordinated compounds.

1. .4 New Method for Ihe Dcterniinatioji of Vapour Pressures and an 
Examination of a Source of Error in certain. Dynamical MctJiods. 
By F. H. Campbell, M.Sc. 

Since none of the accepted methods is suitable for the determination of the 
vapour pressure of a binary mixture of a volatile with a non-volatile liquid a 
new metJiod has been devised for the purpose. 

The principle used is that of allowing a liquid saturated with a suitable gas, 
usually hydrogen, to evaporate into an enclosed space filled with the same gas at 
the same temperature and pressure, the latter being appro.ximately atmospheric. 
The extra pressure exerted by the vapour is measured by means of an open 
mercury manometer after the \olume has been restored to its original value by 
means of a levelling vessel. The method can be applied to volatile organic liquids 
of many kinds, since they come into contact with glass and mercury only. The 
liquid is enclosed in a glass tube projecting through a rubber stopper, which 
closes an opening at the bottom of the vessel, the stopper being protected from 
the action of the liquid by a layer of mercury. When the apparatus has reached 
the temperature of the constant temperature bath in which it is immersed, the 
tube, previously deeply scratched, is broken by gentle sideways pressure on the 
projecting end. Saturation of the gas by the vapour is hastened by gently 
shaking the ap])aratus. 

Experiments have been made with the following liquids and gases : Methyl 
alcohol, ethyl alcoliol, diethyl ether, carbon disulpliide, chloroform and water, 
evaporating into carbon dioxide, air, hydrogen, and, in the case of chloroform, 
nitrogen in addition. In every case the values obtained, though very con- 
cordant, are lower than the most reliable results obtained by the ordinary static 
method. The magnitude of the error evidently de|)ends on the solubility of tlie 
particular gas in the particular liquid as it diminishes in each case, except that 
of water, in the order carbon dioxide, air, liydrogen. Witli water at 00° C. 
the results obtained with air and hydrogen are practically identical. Tlie 
error wjieii hydrogen is used is generally less than 1 per cent., and it is con- 
sidered that tiie agreement is sufficient, as with mixtures the ratio between the 
observed inessuie of tlie solution and that of the pure volatile solvent is to be 
considered. With air the errors are from 3 to 6 per cent., and it is concluded 
that methods depending on the saturation of a current of a gas passing througli 
or over solution and pure solvent must therefore involve more or less error from 
this cause, a fact which does not seem to have been appreciated in tlie past. 
Perman (' Proc. Roy. Soc' 1903, 72, 72) and Krauskopf ('J. Phys. Chem.' 
1910, 14, 489) obtained satisfactmy results with water, although tliose of 
Regnault ('Ann. Chim. Phys.' 1845 (3), 15, 129) and Tammann (' Wied. Ann.' 
1888, 23, 322), w;hieh are lower than those obtained by tlie static method, are 
brought into satisfactory agreement with these upon the author's assumption, 
which indicates that the errors introduced by the presence of a dissolved gas 
are negligible under certain conditions. 



2. A New Method for determining the Specific Heals of Liquids. 
Bij Ernst Johannes Hartung, B.Sc 

The method described, which was suggested by Professor Orme Masson, is 
a modification of the mixture method for determining specific heats. The 
principle consists in measuring the lowering in temperature of a known amount 
of the particular liquid on the introduction of a definite weight of dry ice 
contained in a thin glass bulb. The calorimeter is a thin glass vessel of about 
one hundred cubic centimetres capacity, and is supported inside a silvered Dewar 
tube. A well-fitting rubber stopper closes the mouth of this tube, making the 
apparatus airtight. Tlirough the stopper is fitted a Beikmann thermometer 
and also a thin glass stirring rod, the lower end of which is suitably shaped to 
receive the small ice-bulb. A third hole, lined with glass and closed with a 

1914. z 



338 TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION B. 

well-fitting glass stopi^er, passes through the rubber stopper and serves for the 
introduction of the ice-bulb. This last consists of a sm^U sealed thin glass 
cylindrical bulb, containing a definite weight of distilled water and also as much 
silver gauze as possible. The last ensures rapid heat conduction, and makes 
the bulb heavy enough to sink in dense liquids. The bulb is suspended by a 
fine platinum wire. 

The liquid to be experimented with is introduced into the calorimeter by 
means of a standardisation pipette, and the apparatus is closed until constant 
temperature is attained. The ice-bulb has meanwhile been frozen in a mercury 
bath supported in an ordinary freezing-point apparatus. When the tempera- 
ture of the mercury is constant at from —3° to —4°, the bulb is removed by 
its suspension and rapidly introduced into the lower part of the stirring rod in 
the calorimeter. The liquid is then stirred by hand until constant temperature 
is again attained, which usually requires about three minutes. Eadiation cor- 
rections are then aijplied and the specific heat of the liquid calculated, the heat 
capacity of the ice-bulb being accurately known. The experiments should be 
performed in a room regulated to constant temperature. 

The advantages claimed for the method are its simplicity, its rapidity, and 
its accuracy. Experiments with water at 25'"^ C. gave consistent results agreeing 
to within 0*4 per cent. When ether was used, it was found necessary to coat the 
rubber stopper with tinfoil in order to protect it. The results with ether at 
25° C. agreed to within 1'4 per cent, (the vapour pressure of ether at this tem- 
perature is 545 mm.). The specific heats of several sulphuric-acid- water mixtures 
were also measured and compared with the classical results of J. Thomsen. The 
average divergence was less than one per cent. Further measurements with 
different liquids are now in progress. 

The apparatus de.scribed is not suitable for a viscous liquid (such as 
glycerine) owing to inefficient stirring. By having another liquid than water 
in the carrier-bulb, the scope of the method can probably be extended. 



3. Tlie Influence of W'eaiher Conditions upon the Amounts of Nitric Acid 
and of Nitrous Acid in the Eainfall near Melbourne, Australia. By 
V. G. Andeeson. 

Daily determinations of the amounts of nitric acid and of nitrous acid in 
tlie rainfall at Canterbury, near Melbourne, have been made since November 1, 
1012. The results to February 28, 1914, when correlated with meteorological 
data for Melbourne and daily isobaric charts of Australia, reveal the existence 
of a relation between weather conditions and the amounts of nitrogen acids in 
rain-water. 

The concentration of nitric acid reached a maximum in summer, a minimum 
in winter, and an intermediate position during autumn and spring. The 
concentration of nitrous acid reached a maximum in winter, and a minimum 
in summer. The ratio of nitric nitrogen to nitrous nitrogen was highest in 
summer and lowest in winter. On many occasions during winter the ratio was 
approximately as 1 : 1. A relation between atmospheric temperature and this 
ratio was noted. Its nature was shown by plotting the mean minimum tem- 
perature of each month with the mean monthly ratios, the curve being of the 
same type as those which express changes of chemical velocity with temperature. 
The ratio is doubled tor equal increments of temperature. From the results it 
would appear that in rain-water nitric and nitrous acids are formed in equal 
molecular proportions, and that, if the ratio could be determined instantly, or 
before any change could ensue, it would invariably be as 1 : 1. In cold weather 
the velocity is retarded to such an extent that little change occurs even after 
comparatively long periods ; hence the increased amounts of nitrous acid formd 
in winter. In hot weather, the velocity being greatly increased, the residual 
amounts of nitrous acid are very small," nearly all having been converted into 
nitric acid. The facts point to atmospheric nitrogen peroxide as the source of 
nitric and nitrous acids in rain-water, as this gas reacts with water, forming 
these acids in' equal molecular proportions.

In a graph ploftefl with daily rnnrentrations nf total (nitrio plus nitrons) 
nitrogen as ahscissw^ and with rainfall as ordinatos, the, points are found to 
arrange themselves into a series of rectangular hyperbolfe. Further, each group 
of points lying alon,g a particular curve is found to correspond with falls of rain 
occurring during one particular type of weather. From this it follows that for 
a particular type of weather (1) the concentration of oxidised nitrogen varies 
inversely as the rainfall ; (2) the product of the concentration and the rainfall is 
constant ; (3) the total weight per unit area of oxidised nitrogen precipitated 
with rain falling during twenty-four hours is constant. In brief, the amount 
of oxidised nitrogen per acre carried down by rain falling on any day is a 
function of the type of weather, and, within certain limits, is independent of 
the amount of rainfall. These facts may be explained by assuming that for 
each type of weather there exists in the air a definite concentration of nitrogen 
peroxide, and that this soluble gas is completely washed out of the air by tho 
first portions of a shower : any further rain falling through the now purified 
air not increasing the amount of oxidised nitrogen in the rain-water, but, by 
dilution, decreasing the concentration. 

Nine well-defined recurring types of weather have been investigated. These 
may be classified into three groups, as follows : (1) Antarctic types; (2) Tropical 
types;. (3) Divided control (Antarctic and Tropical) types. The accompanying 
table shows the number of examples of each type investigated, together with 
the oxidised nitrogen constant in pounds per thousand acres, for each type.

4. A Comparison of tJie Phenomena of the Occlusion of Hydrogoi by 
Palhdiuni and by Charcoal. By Dr. A. Holt. 

When all the known facts concerning the occlusion of hydrogen by palladium 
and by charcoal are examined and compared, it appears that, in the case of 
charcoal, absorption and surface condensation, without chemical action, occurs, 
but with palladium the evidence is in favour of the formation of a compound 
in addition to surface condensation. In both cases there is evidence that allo- 
tropes of the occluding solids exist, one allotrope occluding gas with far greater 
aviditv than the other.-

1. Non-Aroviatic Diazoniiim Salts. By Professor Gilbert T. Morgan 

and Joseph Eeilly. 

The diazotisabilitj' of an organic primary amine is in all probability con- 
nected with the presence in the ba.sic molecule of an unsaturated group, for it 
ha.s not yet been found possible to diazotise the salt of any primary base having 
its amino-group attached directly either to a fully saturated radical or to a com- 
pletely hydrogenised ring. 

It is, liowever, not essential that the unsaturated radical should be aromatic 
or homocyclic in character, and certain non-aromatic amines are known to 
possess in varying degrees the property of diazotisability. This property has 
been demonstrated in the case of the following heterocyclic bases not merely by 
detecting the presence of diazo-compounds in solution, but also by the isolation of 
the diazonium salts. 

4-Amino-l-phenyl 2 : 3-dimethylpyrazolone (4-amino-antipyrine) wheii diazo- 
tised with ethyl nitrite in hydrochloric acid furnishes a well-defined crystallis- 
able diazonium hydiochloride (C,, H,, O N^ C1).,HC1 from which the crystal- 
line di.hromate ((!„ H,, O iSi ^)X'i\P,; aurichloride (C,, H,, O NJAuCl, and 
platinichloride (C*,, H,, NJ.PtClj of normal composition have been prepared. 

4-Amino-3 : 5-dimethylpyrazole, a base containing no aromatic substituent 
whatever, gave rise to a remarkably stable colourless diazonium chloride, crystal- 
lising with great facility, and permanent under ordinary atmospheric conditions. 
Although tlie parent base forms a dihydrochloride, (1, H,, N,. 2H("'l, one of the 
salt-forming centres di.sappears in diazotisation, the diazonium chloride 
(',, ri, N, t'l corresponding in composition with the salt of a monacidic base. 

Tlie replacement of the diazonium group liy a triazo-radical restores this 
suppressed salt-forming &lt;entre, the product, 4-triazo-3 : 5-dimethyl-pyrazole being 
a basic compound which has the remaikable property of developing character- 
istic colorations with phenols in alkaline solutions. 

Aminometliyltriazole can be diazotised in nitric-acid solution without loss of 
diazo-nitrogen, although in hydrochloric acid effervescence is copious even at 
0° C. 

The diazotisability of wool is usually attributed to the presence in this 
material of aromatic amino- groups ; but in view of the foregoing results it 
appears possible that the interaction of wool and nitrous acid may be due in 
part to the presence of heterocyclic rings comparable with those of the pyrazole, 
triazole, or thiazole sei'ies. 



2. The Sijnlhesis of Isoquinoliiip AJluiloids. By Professor R. Eobinson. 

Many pseudo- bases of isoquinoline type — for example, cotarnine, liydra- 
stinine, berberine, isoquinoline methyl hydroxide — readily undergo condensa- 
tions with the most varied classes of organic substances, and the greater 
number of these reactions can be generalised in the scheme : —

,CHOH-NMe— -)- HE ^ — CH— NMe— + H.,0 

The interest of these condensations is very much enhanced by the fact that 
they yield substances closely allied in constitution to the naturally occurring 
isoquinoline alkaloids, and for instance cotarnine (I) with meconine (II) gave a 
small yield of a-gnoscopine (III) resolvable by means of rf-bromocamphor- 
sulphonic acid into rZ-narcotine and Z-narcotine, the latter proving identical with 
the natural base occurring in opium. Cotarnine and nitromeconine react "with 
great facility and give rise to a nitro- base from which by elimination of the

nitro- group a stereoisomeric ^-gnoscopine is obtained, and this is convertible to 
a-gnoscopine by prolonged heating with aqueous alcohol. By similar methods a 
stereoisomeride of hydrastine has been synthesised. These condensations also 
open up a method of synthesis of phenanthrene alkaloids (morphine group), and

it is along these lines that further work is being prosecuted. Up to the present 
an isomeride of apomorphine dimethyl ether is the only example of the applica- 
tion of the process. It is probable that the mechanism of the pseudo- base 
condensation involves the stages

a view which receives support from the remarkable rapidity of the reactions and 
from the observation that they occur with greatest readiness in ionising solvents. 
It is also considered extremely probable that such condensations have an 
important role in the synthesis of alkaloids in plants.

It is hoped that this substance will form a suitable starting-point for a 
synthesis of dicentrine. On reduction by stannous chloride these bases yield 
amino ketones, which can then be further reduced to fully saturated bases by 
means of amalgamated zinc and hydrochloric acid. Several bases similar to the 
above have been prepared.

The colouring matter.s of Diuzona viridis and Syutcthys Hebridicus have 
been sliowii to be due to a green body very similar to chlorophyl, and a purple 
substance which appears to be a dibroraindigo. This purple compound is only 
found on the surface of the Ascidian Colony, and it is concluded that it acts as 
an oxygen carrier, since when the organism is alive and healthy it is not pro- 
duced. Under these conditions it would be maintained as the colourless leuco 
body, but "with the death of the colony changes in metabolism take place and 
oxidation produces the colour. The green pigment is very possibly due to a 
.symbiotic alga. These jjigments have been compared with those obtained from 
different .species of Murcx and from Bonellia.

7. Tlie Use of Waste Gases of Combustion for Fire Extinctive and 
Fumigating Purposes. By Dr. G. Hakkee. 

The experiments of Clowes and Feilman on the extinctive properties of 
flames have shown that the Hames of ordinary substances are extinguished 
when the oxygen in the atmosphere is reduced to about 15 per cent. The 
extinction of solid material, as for example ignited coal, requires a lower per- 
centage of oxygen, and takes time owing to the need for a cooling effect. Flue 
gas from ordinary boilers burning coal or coke does not generally contain more 
tlian 9 or 10 per cent, of oxygen, and if pumped into a space so as to displace 
tlic air will render the atmosphere fire-extinctive and will also be destructive to 
rats and other vermin. For practical purposes the flue gas must be cleaned and 
cooled before use, and formaldehyde vapours are sometimes added to it. 
Several installations making use of this process are now in operation.

'J. The Inversion of Cane-sugar by Acids in Water-alcohol Solutiinis. 
By Geokge J. Burrows, B.Sc. 

The rates of inversion of cane-sugar by hydrochloric acid and sulphuric acid 
have been determined in water-alcohol solutions up to 75 per cent, alcohol. 
In both cases a minimum velocity has been found for a solution containing 
about 50 per cent, alcohol by volume. From the results obtained it is evident 
that the velocity of inversion is not proportional to the concentration of hydrogen 
ions in such a series of solvents. The similarity between the curve representing 
the variation of the inversion velocity with the composition of the solvent and 
the viscosity curve for these mixtures led the author to conclude that the rate 
of catalysis by acids is a function of the fluidity of the medium. 

The results for the inversion velocity show that the latter is not directly 



&gt; TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION B. 343 

proportional to the fluidity of the solvent. It was assumed that the effect of 
fluidity on catalysis is similar to its effect on ionic mobility as determined by 
electrical conductivity. Hence by dividing the inversion velocity by the con- 
ductivity of the acid in the particular solvent the result obtained expres.ses the 
activity of the catalytic ion in this medium. In this way it was found that tlia 
activity was far greater in 70 per cent, alcohol than in water. 

It was therefore concluded that catalytic hydrolysis is retarded by the 
addition of water in the same way as esterification and other similar cntalytic 
reactions.

The Cyanogenetic Plants of Neiv South Wales. 
By J.\MRS M. Petrir, T).Sc. 

Of the plants growing in New South Wales, over a thousand species have 
been e.xamined for lij-drocyanic acid and cyanogenetic glucosides. Sixty of tliese 
gave positive results with sodium picrate paper. These include forty-four species 
native to New South Wales in seventeen Natural Orders. 

Some plants, well known to be cyanophoric in Europe, when grown in this 
State have never given any reaction, although tested in all seasons. 

Only a few were found to evolve free hydrocyanic acid, naturally, but all 
.showed the presence of a glucoside and enzyme. 

When the natural enzymes in these plants were killed by boiling water, the 
reaction to sodium picrate paper ceased; if tlien a few drops of emulsin, pre- 
pared from sweet almonds, were added, positive reactions were again obtained, 
showing that in all cases the glucosides present in the plants were capable of 
being hydrolysed by emulsin. 

Of the sixty species stated, twenty are grasses, and these include eleven 
species indigenous to this State. The Sorcihvm viilgare examined by Dunstan 
and Henry was found to lose its glucoside when fourteen inches high, while the 
Australian-grown plant retains it when four feet high, and mature. Both 
glucoside and enzyme slowly disappear with air-drying. 

One hundred and fifty species of grasses were tested systematically for 
seasonal variations, and some were found to give neigative results at particular 
seasons. Two species of grasses alone evolved free hydrocyanic acid, and only 
one of these is available for grazing. This is the only one, except the sorghums, 
which has been associated with fatalities among stock. 

Among the non-cyanogenetic grasses, thirty-three species contained emulsin- 
like enzvmes.

The President delivered the following Address at Sydney, on Friday, 
August 21 : — 

Exactly eighty-three years from the day of our arrival at Sydney, Edward 
Suess was born in London. Thus the day, as much as the circumstances of our 
meeting so far from home, serves to remind us of one who was great enough 
to recognise the fact that geological evidence from any part of the world has 
the same value as that obtained in the little continent which has been the most 
prolific in the products of nomenclature and the most productive in text-books. 

Since the days of Charles Lyell no geologist has been so conspicuously suc- 
cessful in analysing the accumulated mass of evidence, in bringing together the 
essential facts from all lands, and in compensating for the local excesses of 
literature. Only those of us who, by long absence from Europe, have felt the 
full disad\antages of having to express our tlioughts in alien terminology can 
appreciate the real value of Suess's great work. His death since our last meeting 
makes a conspicuous mark in the history of geological science. 

A meeting of the British As.sbciation in Australia brings home forcibly to the 
members of Section C the fact that British Imperial geology is really ' the 
science of the Earth ' ; partly for this reason one feels inclined to get outside 
the science and take a survey of some of its suburbs. Not many of them have 
been left untraversed by my distinguished predecessors in this chair ; but there 
has been of recent years a tendency to avoid the inner Earth, which has rightly 
been described as ' the inalienable playground of the imagination,' and conse- 
quently, therefore, common land to the geologist as well as the gebdesi.st, 
pliysicist, and mathematician. 

The geologist who looks below the purely superficial phenomena of the crust 
is generally regarded as straying beyond his province; but the desire to see the 
birth-certificate of some of the strange and often unacceptable ' causes ' which 
the mathematical physicist offers us is a pardonable form of curiosity. Our 
ideas regarding intratelluric conditions are even proving to be of economic 
value, one of the most recent and imexpected re.sults of the kird being that just 
established by Baron von Elotvos in Hungary,' whose predictions now bid fair 
to outstrip those of the ' diviner ' ! Having noticed the low gravity values over 
the great cores of rock-salt in the Transylvanian ' Schlier,' he finds similar 
defects of gravity in the .same region over certain of the Sarmatian and Pontian 
domes, which probably owe their shape to subterranean salt-plugs and are now 
found to be great storehouses of natural gas, which, with or without liquid 
petroleum, is commonly found with the saline ' Mediterranean ' facies of the 
Upper Tertiary in Eastern Europe. Baron von Eotvos also finds that on the 
eastern margin of the Great Hungarian Plain, where the younger Tertiary beds 
are completely concealed by a mantle of alluvium, mud-volcanoes and gas-springs 
are sometimes found in areas of marked gravity defect, and some of these are 
now also being drilled for natural gas.

PRESIDKNTIAL ADDKKSS. 345 

When our ideas of the state of affairs below the surface thus begin to yield 
economic results, there is hope that they are at last steadying down, becoming 
more settled, and indeed more 'scientific' It may not be unprofitable, tlierefore, 
to review some of tlie advances recently made in developing theoretical concep- 
tions regarding the interior of the Earth that are of direct importance to 
geologists. In undertaking this review I am conscious of the fact that I shall 
be tiaversing ground that is generally familiar to all, and mucli of it the special 
jiropcrty of specialists whose views I hesitate to summarise and should not dare 
to criticise. As the author of the ' Ingoldsby Legends ' said of the only story 
that Mrs. Peters would allow her husband to finish, 'The subject, I fear me, 
is not over new, but will remind my friends — 

" Of something better they have seen before." ' 

The intensity and quantity of polemical literature on scientific problems 
frequently varies inversely as the number of direct observations on which the 
discussions are based : the number and varietj^ of theories concerning a subject 
thus often form a coefficient of our ignorance. Beyond the superficial observa- 
tions, direct and indirect, made by geologists, not extending below about one 
two-hundredth of the Earth's radius, we have to trust to the deductions of 
mathematicians for our ideas regarding the interior of the Earth ; and they 
have provided us successively with every permutation and combination possible 
of the three physical states of matter — solid, liquid, and gaseous. 

Starting, say, two centuries back with the astronomer Halley, geologists were 
presented with a globe whose shell rotated at a rate different from that of its 
core. In more recent times this idea has been revived by Sir F. J. Evans (1878) 
to account for the secular variations in the declination of the magnetic needle. 

Clairault's celebrated theorem (1743), on which Laplace based the most 
long-lived among many cosmogonies, gave us a globe of molten matter sur- 
rounded by a solid crust. Hopkins demanded a globe solid to the core, and, 
thouigh his arguments were considered to be unsound, his conclusions have been 
revived on other grounds ; while the high rigidity of the Earth as a body has 
been maintained by Lord Kelvin, Sir George Darwin, Professor Newcombe, 
Dr. Rudski, and especially by the recent observations of Dr. 0. Hecker, supple- 
mented by the mathematical reasoning of Professor A. E. H. Love. Hennessy 
(1886), however, concluded that the astronomical demands could be satisfied by 
the old-fashioned molten Earth in which the heavier substances conformed to 
the equatorial belt. 

As long ago as 1858 Herbert Spencer suggested that, on account of its tem- 
perature being probably above the critical temperature of known elements, the 
centre of the Earth is possibly gaseous. Late in the 'seventies Dr. Ritter revived 
the idea of a gaseous core surrounded by a solid crust, and this was modified in 
1900 by the Swedish philosopher, Svante Arrhenius, whose globe with a solid 
crust, liquid substratum, and gaseous core is now a favourite among some 
geologists. 

Wiechert (1897) supposed that the core of the Earth, some 5.000 kilometres 
in radius, is composed mostly of iron with a density of 7-8, while this is sur- 
rounded by a shell of lithoidal material having a density of about 3-0 to 3-4; 
and this great contrast in density is about that which distinguishes the iron 
meteorites generally from those of the stony class. Arrhenius also assumes that 
iron forms the main part of the central three-quarters, and he shows that this 
distribution of substance may still be consistent with his theory of a gaseous 
core ; indeed, he not only imagines that the whole of the iron nucleus is gaseous, 
but also most of the siliceous shell, for he leaves only 5 per cent, of the 
radius as the depth of the solid and liquid shells combined. 

But the variety of ideas does not end with theories on the present constitution 
of the globe. Poisson required the process of solidification to begin from the 
centre and to progress outwards, while other mathematicians had been happy 
with the Leibnitzian consist en tior status as the first external slaggy crust. 
Since the days of Laplace all naturalists have been forced to accept the idea of 
a solar system formed by the cooling and condensation of a spheroidal gaseous 
nebula ; and all except those geologists who have vainly searched for traces 
of the primeval crust have been happy in this belief. 

Recently, however, Dr. F. R. Moitlton and Professor T. C, Chamberlin 



346 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C. 

in America have brought together arguments from different points of view to 
construct the solar system by the aggregation of innumerable small bodies, 
'planetesimals,' which have gathered into knots to form the planets. Thus, 
the Earth is supposed to have grown gradually by the accretion of meteoritic 
matter, and even now, although the process has nearly ceased, it receives much 
meteoritic material from outside. 

With the Chamberlin-Moulton theory there must have been a time when the 
gravity of the Earth was insufficient to hold an atmosphere of any but the 
heavier gases, such as carbon dioxide; later, the Earth became heavy enough 
to retain oxygen, then nitrogen, water-vapour, and helium; while even now it 
may not be sufficiently attractive to prevent the light and agile molecule of 
hydrogen from flying off into space. With the growth of the young globe, the 
compression towards the centre produced heat enough to melt the accumulated 
fragments of meteoritic matter, and the molten material thus formed welled 
out at the surface. Such volcanic action is supposed to have predominated 
at the surface until an appreciable atmosphere was formed, and became charged 
with water, when the now familiar pi-ocesses of weathering, erosion, and deposi- 
tion produced the film of ' rust ' which geologists know as sedimentary rocks. 

With this last addition to the variegated array of theories about the physical 
condition of the Earth and about its genealogy, the scientific world began again 
to settle down into serenity, comforted by the happy feeling that all at any rate 
agree in regarding the Earth as a gradually cooling body, with many millions 
of years still before it. Then came the discovei-y of radium, and, with it at 
first, an assurance that geologists were justified in claiming a long past, to be 
followed by a longer future than the most optimistic philosopher had dared 
before to assume with our apparently limited store of Earth-heat. Now, however. 
Professor Joly warns us that if the deeper parts of the globe contain anything 
near the proportion of radioactive bodies found by him in the superficial rocks, 
we may even be tending in the other direction ; that, instead of a peaceful 
cooling" our descendants may have to face a catastrophic heating; the now in- 
conspicuous little body known as the Earth may indeed yet become famous 
through the Universe as a new star.^ 

To add to the variety of ideas regarding the present state of the Earth's 
interior. Professor Schwarz, of Grahamstown,^ concludes that our volcanic 
phenomena can bo accounted for on the assumption that the main mass of the 
Earth below a superficial layer is cold and solid throughout, being composed, 
like the meteorites, largely oif unaltered ferrnmagnesian silicates and iron. 

Tluis, we see, whole fleets of hypotheses have been launched on this sea of 
controversy : some of the craft have been decoyed by the cipher-signals of the 
mathematician ; some have foundered after bombardment by the heavy missiles 
classically reserved for use by militant geologists; others, though built in the 
dockyard of physicists, have suffered from the siJontaneous combustion set up 
by an inadvertent shipment of radium. Still, some of these hypotheses are yet 
apparently seaworthy, and it may not be unprofitable to compare them with 
recently acquired data. 

The nearest approach to actual observation with regard to the state of the 
Earth's interior has been obtained by the seismograph, designed to record the 
movements of seismic waves at great distances from the disturbing earthquake. 
Some of the waves sent forth from an earthquake-centre travel through the 
Earth, and some travel around by the superficial crust, the former reaching 
the distant seismograph before the latter. The seismograph, by its record of the 
waves that travel through the Earth, has thus given a certain amount of infor- 
mation regarding the state of the Earth's interior which R. D. Oldham aptly 
regards as analogous to that given by the spectroscope ■* with regard to the 
inaccessible atmosphere of the Sun.

Oldham has the precedence by just two years (c/. Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc,

PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 347 

The existence of two groups of earthquake-waves— those passing throU|gh 
aiui tliose passing near the surface around the Earth— has long been recognised | 
luit R. D. Oldham ' has shown that the waves passing through the Earth are 
ot two kinds, travelling at two different speeds. 

The record on the distant seismograph thus shows three well-marked phases : 
the first ]iliase, due to waves of compression passing through the Eartli's interior; 
the second phase, due to waves of distortion,' also passing through the Earth's 
Ulterior; and the third phase, recorded by the waves which pass around the 
arc along the superficial crust. 

The third phase is always recorded at a time after the occurrence of tlic 
shock proportional to the arcual distance of the recording seismograph from the 
earthquake centre, the records of several large earthquakes showing an average 
sj)ced for the waves of about three kilometres per second. The rates of propa- 
g^itiou of the waves giving the first and second phases are both much greater 
than of those forming the third phase ; and up to an arcual distance of about 
120 from the earthquake's centre the rate of their propagation increases with 
the distance. It is thus assumed that the waves giving rise to the first and 
second phases in each distant seismographic record, by following approximately 
along the chord of the arc between the place of origin and the instrument, 
pass through deeper layers of the Earth when the seismograph is farther away, 
tlie material at greater depths being presumably more elastic as well as denser. 

But Oldham ' has shown that when the seismograph is as much as 150° from 
the earthquake centre there is a remarkable decrease in the mean apparent 
rate of propagation of the waves giving the second phase in the record, from 
over six to about four and a half kilometres per second. There is also a drop, 
although not nearly so marked, in the apparent speed of the waves of the first 
phase when transmitted to a sedsmograph 150° or more distant from the earth- 
quake origin. Oldham concludes that this decrease of apparent rate for waves 
travelling through the Earth to places much more than 120° distant is due to 
their passing into a central core, four-tenths of the radius in thickness, com- 
posed of matter which transmits the waves at a markedly slow speed. Thus 
the earthquake waves which emerge at a distance not greater than 120° from 
their origin do not enter this central core, while those which pass into the Earth 
to a greater depth than six-tenths of the radius are supposed to be refracted on 
entering, and a^gain on leaving the postulated core, in which the rate of trans- 
mission of an elastic wave of distortion is verv much slower than in the main 
mass of the Earth around. In consequence of "the refraction of these waves on 
passing through the central core, places situated at about 140° from an earthquake 
origin should be in partial shadow, due to the great dispersion of the distortioiuil 
waves and the few records made so far by seismographs thus situated with 
regard to great earthquakes show that there is either no, or at most a doubtful 
record for the second phase, which is known to be due to the so-called dis- 
tortioiw waves. 

Oldham's deductions are based confessedly on a small number of earthquake 
records-he considered fourteen examples only— but the conclusions based on a 
sina 1 number of trustworthy records, from which variations due to the different 
metliods of marking the phases are eliminated, are more reliable than those for 
wtuch tliere are imperfect distant records as well as doubts regarding the e.vact 
times of the disturbances. If these observations, however, 'be confirmed by 
iurther records, we are justified in assuming that below the heterogeneous 
crust tliere is a thick shell of elastic material, fairlv homogeneous to about six- 
teiiths ot the radius, surrounding a central core, four-tenths in thickness, wliicli 
j)ossesses physical properties utterly unlike those of the outer layers; for in 
this core the ' distortional ' waves are either damped completely or are trans- 
mitted at very much lower speeds than in the shell.

348 TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION C. 

One cannot consider this interesting inference from the seismographic data 
without being reminded of the contention of Ritter, Arrhenius, and Wilde 
regarding the possibility of a persistent gaseous core still above the critical tem- 
perature of the substances of which it is composed. According to Ritter/ the 
gaseous core is surrounded by a solid shell. Dr. Wilde ' postulates the existence 
of a liquid substratum and a gaseous core within a solid crust, the two outer 
shells having a thickness that is ' not very considerable.' Arrhenius assumes 
from purely physical considerations that the solid crust is only about twenty-five 
miles thick, that below this it is possibly in a molten condition for about a 
hundred and fifty miles, and that the rest is a gas largely composed of iron 
under a pressure so great that its compressibility is not much less than that of 
steel. 

The whole of these conclusions, being based on assumptions regarding the 
physical properties of matter under conditions, of temperature and pressure that 
are well beyond those of actual experience, must be put on a plane of science 
well below that occupied by the investigations initiated by Oldham, who opens 
up a line of research in which, as said before, the seismograph may justifiably 
be compared with the spectroscope as an instrument for observing some inacces- 
sible regions of Nature. 

The mathematician apparently finds it just as easy to prove that the Earth 
is solid throughout as to show by extrapolation from known physical values that 
it must be largely gaseous. As Huxley said in his Presidential Address to the 
Geological Society in 1869, the mathematical mill is a mill which grinds you 
stuff of any degree of fineness, but, nevertheless, it can grind only what is put 
into it ; and the seismograph thus offers a new source of substantial grist. Now 
that it is fairly certain that some ui the earthquake-waves pass through the 
deeper parts of the Earth, it is obvious that a fruitful development of science 
will follow successful efforts to introduce precision in recording, and uniformity 
of expression in reading, seismographic records. 

Oldham '" has pointed out another way in which analysis of seismographic 
records may lead to information regarding intra-telluric conditions by comparing 
the records of waves that pass under the oceanic depressions with those that 
are sub-continental for the whole or most of their paths. By comparing the 
records in Europe of the Colombian earthquake of January 31, 1906, with those 
of the San Francisco quake in the following April, there was a greater interval 
noticed between the first and second phases of the Californian earthquake — 
an interval greater than can be accounted for by mere difference of distance 
between the origin of the shock and the recording instruments. The seismic 
waves which passed from Colombia to Europe must have travelled under the 
broadest and deepest part of the North Atlantic basin, while those from 
California ran under the continent of North America, crossed the North Atlantic 
not far south of Iceland, and approached Europe froiii the north-west, the wave 
paths throughout being under continents or the continental shelf of the North 
Atlantic. There is thus suggested some difference between the elastic con- 
ditions of the sub-oceanic and the sub-continental parts of the crust — a difference 
which, judging by the particular instances discussed, may extend to a depth of 
one-quarter of the radius, but is not noticeable in the waves which penetrate 
to one-third of the radius below the surface. 

Obviously these data must be multiplied many times before they can be 
regarded as a reliable index to a natural law ; but it is significant that this

PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 349 

indication of a difference between the pliysical nature of the sub-oceanic and 
sub-continental parts of the crust is in rough correspondence with the conclusions 
previously suggested on quite other grounds. 

In his Presidential Address to the Geographical Section of the British 
Association at Dover in 1899, the late Sir John Murray drew attention to the 
chemical differentiation which has been going on between the continents and 
the oceans since the processes of weathering and denudation commenced. By 
these processes the more siliceous and specifically lighter constituents are left 
behind on the continents, while the heavier bases are carried out to the ocean. 
It is to this process that Professor T. C. Chamberlin " also ascribes the origin 
of the depressions in which the oceanic waters have accumulated. As a 
corollary of the planetesimal theory, Chamberlin assumes that water began to 
be forced out of the porous surface blocks of the accumulated meteoritic material 
when the Earth's radius was between 1,500 and 1,800 miles shorter than it is 
now ; at that time pools of water began to be formed on the surface, and the 
atmosphere, just commencing its work, began the operation of leaching tlie 
heavier bases out of the highlands. Growth of the world proceeded by the 
infall of planetesimals, and while those meteorites that fell on the lughlands 
became deprived of their soluble bases, those that fell into the young ocean 
were merely buried unaltered. Thus, by the time the Earth reached its present 
size its crust under the oceanic depressions must have developed a chemical 
composition differing from that under the continents. According to the deduc- 
tion suggested by Oldham from the seismographic records, there is a noticeable 
difference in the sub-oceanic areas to depths of between 1,000 and 1,300 miles— a 
layer in which the followers of Chamberlin's theory might reasonably expect 
some physical expression of the partially developed chemical differentiation. 

The occurrence of denser material below the oceans has, of course, long 
been assumed from the deflection of the plumb-line, and was accepted by Pratt 
for his theory of compensation, as well as by Button as a wide expression of the 
theory of isostasy. Cliamberlain '- tluis explains the general prevalence of basic 
lavas in oceanic volcanoes. 

The apparent heterogeneity indicated in the outer shell of the Earth to depths 
of 1,000 miles is naturally in conflict with the assumption that from thirty miles 
or so down the materials are in a liquid condition ; at any rate, the idea con- 
flicts with Fisher's extreme conception of the liquid substratum, in which the 
fluidity is supposed to be sufficient for the production of convection currents, 
upwards beneath the oceanic depressions, spreading horizontally towards the 
continents, and thence downwards to complete the circuit. 

The idea that changes of azimuth and of latitude may be brought about by 
the sliding of the Earth's crust over its core has been put forward more than 
once to account for the climatic changes of past geological ages — the occurrence 
of temperate or even warm climates on parts of the crust now within the polar 
circles, and glacial conditions at the sea-level in countries like India, Australia, 
Africa, and South America, which are now far from the polar ice-sheets and 
in some cases near or within the tropics. Professor E. Koken, of Tiibinwen," 
in an elaborate memoir entitled ' Indisches Perm und die Permische Eiszeit ' 
attributes the idea of a sliding crust to Mr. E. D. Oldham j but a similar 
suggestion was put forward by the late Sir John Evans twenty years before the 
publication of Mr. Oldham's paper," and when the theory was restated in more 
precise form, ten years later, '^ it was subjected to mathematical criticism bv

Sir Jnlin Evans suggested that this movement of tlie rrnst was inevitable as 
a consequence of the moulding of the orographical features and consequent 
redistribution of weights; but Twis^den came to the conclusion that the re- 
arrangement of the great inequalities on the Earth's surface would be insufficient 
to produce any appreciable sliding of the order required to make material 
differences in the climate of any place. 

Oldliam," who was writing at the time in the field in India and thus away 
from literature, put forward the idea in 1886 as an independent thought, and 
made use of Fisher's new theory regarding the existence of a fluid stratum be- 
tween the solid crust and the supposed solid core to account for the shifting 
of places relative to the axis of rotation from the equatorial region even to the 
polar circles. Oldham drew attention to the recorded small changes of latitude 
at certain observatories and to the probable changes of azimuth in the Pyramids 
of Egypt — evidences of a kind which have since been greatly enlarged by the 
work of Sir Norman Lockyer and others. 

The movements assumed to have taken place during tlie human period are 
of course small ; and to- project from them changes as great as the transfer of 
lands from the polar circle to the tropics has the objection that characterises a 
surveyor's use of ' unfavourable ' triangles in a trigonometrical survey. Before 
admitting, therefore, that these small changes of latitude and of azimuth may be 
classed with the palseo-glacialists' evidence as data of the same kind, though 
so utterly different in magnitude, it is desirable briefly to examine the geological 
evidence regarding past ice-ages in extra-polar areas. 

From the records of ancient glaciations we might omit those of the pre- 
Cambrian rocks of North Ontario and the pre-Upper Cambrian of Norway, as 
these areas are nearer the poles than many places which were certainly covered 
with ice-sheets during the youngest, or often so-called Great, Ice Age. But 
besides these we have evidence of glaciation in the Cambrian or possibly pre- 
Cambriau rocks of South Australia at a latitude of 35° or less; in South Africa 
there were two or more distinct glacial periods before Lower Devonian times in 
slightly lower latitudes; while in China similar records are found among rocks 
of the Lower Cambrian, or possibly of older age, at a latitude of 31° N. 

The glacial boulder-beds found at the base of our great coal-bearing system 
in India belong to the same stratigraphical horizon as the glacial beds found in 
South Africa, certain parts of Australia, and in parts of Brazil and Sao Paulo 
near or within the southern tropic. 

These glacial beds are often referred to in geological literature as Permo- 
Carboniferous in age; but Professor Koken regarded the formation in India_ as 
Permian. Other valuations of palseontological evidence, similar to that relied 
on by Professor Koken, place these beds at a distinctly lower horizon in the 
European stratigraphical scale, and recent work by officers of the Geological 
Survey of India in Kashmir tends to confirm this latter view ; we now regard the 
base of our great coal-bearing system in India — the horizon of the glacial-boulder- 
beds— as not much, if at all, younger than the Upper Coal Measures of Britain."* 
The precise age of the horizon is not very important for our present considera- 
tion : the important point is that in or near Upper Carboniferous times a wide- 
spread glaciation occurred throughout the area now occupied by India, Australia, 
and South Africa. The records of this great glaciation are thus found stretch- 
ing northwards beyond the northern as well as southwards beyond the southern 
tropic. 

Now, on the assumption that the cold climate in this region was due to a 
movement of the crust over the nucleus. Professor Koken has produced an 
elaborate map of the World, showing the distribution of land and sea during 
the period, with the directions of ocean-currents and of ice-sheets. The 
Permian South Pole he places at the point of intersection of the present 
20th parallel S. and 80th meridian E.— that is, at a point in the Indian Ocean 
about equidistant from the glaciated regions of India, Australia, and South 
Africa. The Permian North Pole is thus forced to take up its position in the 
centre of Mexico, while the Equator strikes through Eussia, Italy, West 
Africa, down through the South Atlantic and round by Fiji to Vladivostock.

PKESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. _^ _ _^[ 351 

The very iJrecision of this map reduces the theory on which it is based to a 
condition of unstable equilibrium. If glacial conditions were developed in 
India, Australia, and South Africa by a 70° movement of the crust, were the 
movements to and from its assumed position in Permian times so rapid that the 
glaciation of these widely separated areas appears to be geologically contem- 
poraneous ? If such movements had occurred, instead of evidences of glaciation 
over a wide area at the same period, we ought rather to find that the glaciation 
in each of the widely separated points occurred during distinctly different 
geological periods. 

But that is not the only weak spot in the evidence. The Permian (or Permo- 
Carboniferous) glaciation of Australia took place on the east and south-east of 
the continent as well as in Western Australia, and the eastern ice-sheets would 
thus have been active within 30° of Professor Koken's Permian equator. There 
are still three other serious pieces of colour-discord in this picture. In the 
State of Slo Paulo — that is, within Koken's ' Permian ' tropics — Dr. Orville 
Derby has described beds which strikingly recall the features of the Upper 
Palaeozoic glacial beds of India and South Africa. It is jiossible that these 
are due to the work of glaciers at a high level ; but, since the publication of 
Professor Koken's memoir, other occurrences of the kind have been described 
by Dr. I. C. White in different parts of Brazil, and there is a general 
correspondence between the jihenomena in South America and those in the 
formations of the same age in the Indian, Australian, and African regions. 

Then, too, if we accept this expression of the physical geography during 
Upper Palaeozoic times, we must carefully explain away the suspicious breccias 
and brockrams which have been regarded by many geologists as evidences of a 
cold climate during Permian times in the Urals, the Thiiringerwald, the Engli.sh 
Midland and Northern counties, Devonshire and Armagh — places that would 
lie on or near Koken's ' Permian ' equator. Finally, we find the hypothetical 
Permian North Pole in a locality which has failed to produce any signs of 
glaciation. 

To attempt a discussion of the explanations offered to account for the great 
Upper Palaeozoic glaciation would lead us far from the present theme. The 
question is raised merely to show that the phenomena are not consistent with 
the supposed movement of a solid shell over a solid core assisted by an 
intermediate molten lubricant. Geologists may be compelled to hand back the 
theory of a molten substratum to the mathematicians and physicists for further 
repair ; but it does not necessarily follow that a foundation theory is unsound 
merely because it has been overloaded beyond its compressive strength. 

The extraordinarily great distances between the areas that show signs of 
glaciation in Permo-Carboniferous times form a serious stumbling-block to most 
of the explanations which have hitherto been offered. One is almost tempted in 
despair even to ask if it is not possible I'iiat these fragments of the old 
Gondwana continent are now more widely separated from one another than they 
were in Upper Palaeozoic times. It is a bold suggestion indeed that one can 
safely put aside as absurd in geomorphology. There is nothing else apparently 
left for us but the assumption of a general refrigeration. 

The idea of the greater inequalities of the globe being in approximately static 
equilibrium has been recognised tor many years : it was expressed by Babbage 
and Herschel; it was included in Archdeacon Pratt's theory of compensation; 
and it was accepted by Fisher as one of the fundamental facts on which his 
theory of mountain structure rested. But in 1889 Captain C. E. Dutton pre- 
sented the idea ' in a modified form, in a new dress, and in greater detail ' ; he 
gave the idea orthodox baptism and a name, which seems to be necessary for the 
respectable life of any scientific theory. ' For the condition of equilibrium of 
figure, to which gravitation tends to reduce a planetary body, irrespective of 
whether it be homogeneous or not,' Dutton " proposed ' the name isostasy.' 
The corresponding adjective would be isostatic — the state of balance between 
the ups and downs on the Earth. 

For a long time geologists were forced to content themselves with the con- 
clusion that the folding of strata is the result of the crust collapsing on a cooling

and shrinking core; but Fisher pointed out that the amount of radial shrinking 
could not account even for the present great surface inequalities of the litho- 
sphere, without regard to the enormous lateral shortening indicated by the 
folds in great mountain regions, some of which, like the Himalayan folds, were 
formed at a late date in the Earth's history, folds which in date and direction 
have no genetic relationship to G. H. Darwin's primitive wrinkles. Then, 
besides the folding and plication of the crust in some areas, we have to account 
for the undoubted stretching which it has suffered in other places, stretching 
of a kind indicateH by faults so common that they are generally known as normal 
faults. It has been estimated by Claypole that the folding of the Appalachian 
range resulted in a horizontal compression of the strata to a belt less than 
65 per cent, of the original breadth. According to Heim the diameter of the 
northern zone of the central Alps is not more than half the original extension 
of the strata when they were laid down in horizontal sheets. De la Beche, in 
his memoir on Devon and Cornwall, which anticipated many problems of more 
than local interest, pointed out that, if the inclined and folded strata were 
flattened out again, they would cover far more ground than that to which they 
are now restricted on the geological map. Thus, according to Dutton, Fisher, 
and others, the mere contraction of the cooling globe is insufficient to account 
for our great rock-folds, especially great folds like those of the Alps and the 
Himalayas, which have been produced in quite late geological times. It_ is 
possible that this conclusion is in the main true ; but in coming to this conclusion 
we must give due value to the number of patches which have been let into the 
old crustal envelope — masses of igneous rock, mineral veins and hydrated pro- 
ducts which have been formed in areas of temporary stretching, and liave 
remained as permanent additions to the crust, increasing the size and bagginess 
of the old coat, which, since the discovery of radium, is now regarded as much 
older than was formerly imagined by non geological members of the scientific 
world. 

The peculiar nature of rock-folds presents also an obstacle no less formidable 
from a qualitative point of view. If the skin were merely collapsing on its shrink- 
ing core we should expect wrinkles in all directions; yet we find great folded 
areas like the Himalayas stretching continuously for 1,400 miles, with signs of 
a persistently directed overthrust from the north ; or we have folded masses 
like the Appalachians of a similar order of magnitude stretching from Maine 
to Georgia, with an unmistakable compression in a north-west to south-east 
direction. The simple hypothesis of a collapsing crust is thus 'quantitatively 
iiisutlicient,' according to Dutton, though this is still doubtful, and it is 
'qualitatively inapplicable,' which is highly probable. 

In addition to the facts that rock-folds arc maintained over such great 
distances and that later folds are sometimes found to be superimposed on oldei- 
ones, geologists have to account for the conditions whicli permit of the gradual 
accumulation of enormous thicknesses of strata without corresponding rise of 
the surface of deposition. 

On the other hand, too, in folded regions there are exposures of beds super- 
imposed on one another with a total thickness of many miles more than the 
height of any known mountain, and one is driven again to conclude that uplift 
has proceeded iKiri ■passu with the removal of the load through the erosive work 
of atmospheric agents. 

It does not necessarily follow that these two processes are the direct result 
of loading in one case aiid of relief in the other; for slow subsidence gives rise 
to the conditions that favour deposition and the uplifting of a range results in 
the increased energy of eroding streams. 

Thus there was a natural desire to see if Dutton's theory agreed with the 
variations of gravity. If the ups and downs are balanced, the apparently large 
mass of a mountain-range ought to be compensated by lightness of material in 
and below it. Dutton was aware of the fact that this was approximately true 
regarding the great continental plateaux and oceanic depressions; but he 
imagined that the balance was delicate enough to show up in a small hill-range 
of 3,000 to 5,000 feet. 

The data required to test this theory, accumulated during the triangulation 
of the United States, have been made the subject of an elaborate analysis by 



fRESlOENTIAL ADDRESS. 353 

J. h\ Hayford and \V. Bowie/" They find that, by adopting the hypothesis 
of isostatic compeiisatioii, the differences between the observed and computed 
deflections of the vertical caused by topographical inequalities are reduced to 
less than one-tenth of the mean values which they would have if no isostatic 
compensation existed. According to the hypothesis adopted, the inequalities 
of gravity are assumed to die out at some uniform depth, called the depth of 
compensation, below the mean sea-level. The columns of crust material "stand- 
ing above this horizon vary in length according to the topography, being rela- 
tively long in highlands and relatively short under the ocean. The shorter 
columns are supposed to be composed of denser material, so that the product 
of the length of each column by its mean density would be the same for all 
places._ It was found that, by adopting 122 kilometres as the depth of com- 
pensation, the deflection anomalies were most effectually eliminated, but there 
still remained unexplained residuals or local anomalies of" gravity to be accounted 
for. 

Mr. G. K. Gilbert,-' who was one of the earliest geologists to turn to account 
Button's theory of isostasy, has recently offered a plausible theory to account 
for these residual discrepancies between the observed deflections and those 
computed on the assumption of isostatic compensation to a depth of 122 kilo- 
metres. An attempt had already been made by Hayford and Bowie to correlate 
the distribution of anomalies with the main features of the geological map and 
with local changes in load that have occurred during comparatively recent 
geological times. For example, they considered the possibility of an increased 
load 111 the lower Mississippi valley, where there has been in recent times a 
steady deposition of sediment, and therefore possibly the accumulation of mass 
slightly in advance of isostatic adjustment. One would expect in such a case 
that there would be locally shown a slight excess of gravity, but, on the con- 
trary, there is a general prevalence of negative anomalies "in this region. In 
the Appalachian region, on the other hand, where there has been during late 
geological times continuous erosion, with consequent unloading, one would expect 
that the gravity values would be lower, as isostatic compensation would 
naturally lag behind the loss of overburden; this, however, is also not the case 
for over a greater part of the Appalachian region the anomalies are of tlie 
positive order. Similarly, in the north central region, where there has been 
since Pleistocene times a removal of a heavy ice-cap, there is still a general 
prevalence of positive anomalies. 

These anomalies must, therefore, remain unexxilained by any of the obvious 
lihenomena at the command of the geologist. G. K. Gilbert now suggests that 
while It may be true that the product of the length of the unit column by 
Its mean density may be the same, the density variations within the column 
may be such as to give rise to different effects on the pendulum. If, for instance, 
one considers two columns of the same size and of exactly the same weight, with' 
in one case, the heavy material at a high level and in the other case with the 
heavy material at a low level, the centre of gravity of the former column, being 
nearer the surface, will manifest itself with a greater pull on the pendulum- 
these columns would be, however, in isostatic adjustment."^ '

isostasy to hold, is it not possible that in any two columns of matter extending

mass, and yet that the density may be very differently distributed in the two

Gilbert's hypothesis thus differs slightly from the conception put forth by 
Hayf ord and Bowie ; for Gilbert assumes that there is still appreciable hetero- 
geneity in the more deep-seated parts of the Earth, while Hayford and Bowie's 
hypothesis assumes that in the nuclear mass density anomalies have practically 
disappeared, and that there is below the depth of compensation an adjustment 
such as would exist in a mass composed of homogeneous concentric shells. 

In order to make the Indian observations comparable to those of the United 
States as a test of the theory of isostasy, Major H. L. Crosthwait -■* has adopted 
Hayford's system of computation and has applied it to 102 latitude stations and 
18 longitude stations in India. He finds that the unexplained residuals in India 
are far more pronounced than they are in the United States^ or, in other words, 
it would appear that isostatic conditions are much more nearly realised in 
America than in India. 

The number of observations considered in India is still too small for the 
formation of a detailed map of anomalies, but the country can be divided into 
broad areas which show that the mean anomalies are comparable to those of the 
United States only over the Indian peninsula, which, being a mass of rock 
practically undisturbed since early geological times, may be regarded safely as 
having approached isostatic equilibrium. To the north of the peninsula three 
districts form a wide band stretching west-north-westwards from Calcutta, with 
mean residual anomalies of a positive kind, while to the north of this band lies 
the Himalayan belt, in which there is always a large negative residual. 

Colonel Burrard "' has considered the Himalayan and Sub-Himalayan 
anomalies in a special memoir, and comes to the conclusion that the gravity 
deficiency is altogether too great to be due to a simple geosynclinal depression 
filled with light alluvium such as we generally regard the Gangetic trough to 
be. He suggests that the rapid change in gravity values near the southern 
margin of the Himalayan mass can be explained only on the assumption of the 
existence of a deep and narrow rift in the sub-crust parallel to the general 
Himalayan axis of folding. A single large rift of the kind and size that Colonel 
Jjurrard postulates is a feature for which we have no exact parallel; but one 
must be careful not to be misled by the use of a term which, while conveying a 
definite mental impression to a mathematician, appears to be incongruous with 
our geological experience. There may be no such thing as a single large rift 
filled with light alluvial material, but it is possible that there may still be a 
series of deep-seated fissures that might afterwards become filled with mineral 
matter. 

With this conception of a rift or a series of rifts. Colonel Burrard is led to 
reverse the ordinary mechanical conception of Himalayan folding. Instead now 
of looking upon the folds as due to an overthrust from the north, he regards 
the corrugations to be the result of an under-creep of the sub-crust towards the 
north. Thus, according to this view, the Himalaya, instead of being pushed 
over like a gigantic rock-wave breaking on to the Indian Horst, is in reality 
being dragged away from the old peninsula, the depression between being filled 
up gradually by the Gangetic alluvium. So far as the purely stratigraphical 
features are concerned, the effect would be approximately the same whether 
there is a superficial overthrust of the covering strata or whether there is a 
deep-seated withdrawal of the basement which is well below the level of 
observation. 

Since the Tibetan expedition of ten years ago we have been in possession 
of definite facts which show that to the north of the central crystalline axis 
of the Himalaya there lies a great basin of marine sediments forming a fairly 
complete record from Paleozoic to Tertiary times, representing the sediments 

columns? These two columns,- though in isostatic equilibrium, would act 
differently on the plumb-line owing to the unequal distribution of mass. 

' The drawback to treating this subject by hard and fast mathematical 
formulaB is that we are introducing into a discussion of the constitution of the 
earth's crust a uniform method when, in reality, probably no uniformity 
exists.'

wliicli were laid down in the great central Eurasian ocean to which Suess gave 
the name Tetliyx. We have thus so far been regarding the central crystalline 
axis of the Himalaya as approximately coincident with the old northern coast- 
line of Gondwanaland; but, if Colonel Burrard's ideas be correct, the coast-line 
must have been very much further to the south before the Himalayan folding 
began. 

Representing what the Geological Survey of India regards as the orthodox 
view, air. H. H. Hayden " has drawn attention to some conclusions which, from 
our present geological knowledge, appear to be strange and improbable in 
Colonel Burrard's conclusions, and he also offers alternative explanations for 
the admitted geodetic facts. Mr. Hayden suggests, for instance, that the 
depth of isostatic compensation may be quite different under the Himalayan 
belt from that under the regions to the sonth. His assumptions, however, in 
this respect are, as pointed out by Colonel G. P. Lenox Conyngham," at variance 
with the whole theory of isostasy. Mr. Hayden then suggests that most of the 
excessive anomalies would disappear if we took into account the low specific 
gravity of the Sub-Himalaj'an sands and gravels of Upper Tertiary age as 
well as of the Pleistocene and recent accumulations of similar material filling 
the Indo-Gangetio depre.ssion. It would not be at all inconsistent with our 
ideas derived from geology to regard the Gangetic trough as some three or four 
miles deep near its northern margin, thinning out gradually towards the undis- 
turbed mass of the Indian peninsula, and Mr. R. D. Oldham,-' with this view, 
has also calculated the effect of such a wedge of alluvial material of low specific 
gravity, coming to the conclusion that the rapid change in deflection, on 
passing from the Lower Himalaya southward towards the peninsula, can mainly 
be explained by the deficiency of mass in the alluvium itself. 

It is obvious that, before seeking for any unusual cause for the gravity 
anomalies, we ought to take into account the effect of this large body of alluvium 
which lies along the southern foot of the range. It is, however, by no means 
certain that a thick mass of alluvial material, accumulated slowly and saturated 
with water largely charged with carbonate of lime, would have a specific gravity 
so appreciably lower than that of the rocks now exposed in the main mass of 
the Himalaya as to account for the residual anomalies. Some of the apparent 
deficiency in gravity is due to this body of alluvium, but it will only be after 
critical examination of the data and more precise computation that we shall 
be in a position to say if there is still room to entertain 'Colonel Burrard's very 
interesting hypothesis. 

By bringing together the geological and geodetic results we notice five 
roughly parallel bands stretching across northern India. There is (1) a band 
of abnormal high gravity lying about 150 miles from the foot of the mountains, 
detected by the plumb-line and pendulum; (2) the great depression filled by 
the Gangetic alluvium ; (3) the continuous band of Tertiary rock, forming the 
Sub-Himalaya, and separated by a great boundary overthrust from (4) the main 
mass of the Outer and Central Himalaya of old unfos.^iliferous rock, with the 
snow-covered crystalline peaks flanked on the north by (5) the Tibetan basin of 
highly fossiliferous rocks formed in the great Eurasian mediterranean ocean 
that persisted up to nearly the end of Mesozoic times. 

That these leading features in North India can hardly be without genetic 
relationship one to another is indicated by the geological history of the area. 
Till nearly the end of the Mesozoic era the line of crystalline, snow-covered 
peaks now forming the Central Himalaya was not far from the shore-line 
between Gondwanaland, stretching away to the south, and Tethys, the great 
Eurasian ocean. Near the end of Mesozoic times there commenced the great 
outwelling of the Deccan Trap, the remains of which, after geological ages of 
erosion, still cover an area of 200,000 square miles, with a thickness in places of 
nearly 5,000 feet. Immediately after the outflow of this body of basic lava, 
greater in mass than any known eruption of the kind, the ocean flowed into 
North-West India and projected an arm eastwards to a little beyond the point

at wliich the Ganges now emerges from the liills. Then followed the folding 
movements that culminated in the present Himalayan range, the elevation 
developing first on the Bengal side, and extending rapidly to the north west 
until the folds extended in a great arc for some 1,400 miles from south-east to 
north-west. 

New streams developed on the southern face of the now rising mass, and 
although the arm of the sea that existed in early Tertiary times became choked 
with silt, the process of subsidence continued, and the gradually subsiding 
depression at the foot of the hills as fast as it developed became filled with 
silt, sand, gravel, and boulders in increasing quantities as the hills became 
mountains and the range finally reached its present dimensions, surpassing in 
size all other features of the kind on the face of the globe. 

Now, it is important to remember that for a(ges before the great outburst of 
Deccan Trap occurred there was a continual unloading of Gondwanaland, and 
a continual consequent overloading of the ocean bed immediately to the north ; 
that this process went on with a gradual rise on one side and a gradual depres- 
sion on the other ; and that somewhere near and parallel to the boundary line 
the crust must have been undergoing stresses which resulted in strain, and, as 
I suggest, the development of those fissures that let loose the floods of Deccan 
Trap and brought to an end the delicate isostatic balance. 

During the secular subsidence of the northern shore line of Gondwanaland, 
accompanied by the slow accumulation of sediment near the shore and the 
gradual filing away of the land above sea-level, there must have been a gradual 
creep of the crust in a northerly direction. Near the west end of the Himalayan 
arc this movement would be towards the north-west for a part of the time ; 
at the east end the creep would be towards the north-north-east and north-east. 
Thus there would be a tendency from well back in Palaeozoic times up to the 
end of the Cretaceous period for normal faults — faults of tension — to develop 
on the land, with a trend varying from W.S.W.-E.N.E. to W.N.W.-E.S.E. 
across the northern part of Gondwanaland. We know nothing of the evidence 
now pigeon-holed below the great mantle of Gangetic alluvium, while the 
records of the Himalayan region have been masked or destroyed by lat€r fold- 
ings. But in the stratified rocks lying just south of the southern margin of the 
great alluvial belt we find a common tendency for faults to strike in this way 
across the present Peninsula of India. These faults have, for instance, marked 
out the great belt of coalfields stretching for some 200 miles from east to west 
in the Damuda valley. On this, the east side of India, the fractures of tension 
have a general trend of W.N.W.-E.S.E. We know that these faults are later 
than the Permian period, but some of them certainly were not much later. 

If now we go westwards across the Central Prov'inces and Central India and 
into the eastern part of the Bombay Presidency, we find records of this kind 
still more strikingly preserved ; for where the Gondwana rocks, ranging from 
Permo-Carboniferous to Liassic in age, rest on the much older Vindhyan series, 
we find three main series of these faults. One series was developed before 
Permo-Carboniferous times; another traverses the lower Gondwanas, which 
range up to about the end of Permian times; while the third set affects the 
younger and Upper Gondwanas of about Rhtetic or Liassic age. Although 
the present topography of the country follows closely the outlines of the geo- 
logical formations, it is clear from the work of the Geological Survey of India 
that these outlines -ivere determined in Mesozoic times, and that the movements 
which formed the latest series of faults were but continuations of those which 
manifested themselves in Palaeozoic times. According to Mr. J. G. Medlicott 
the field data showed ' that a tendency to yield in general east and west or 
more clearly north-east and south-west lines existed in this great area from the 
remote period of the Vindhyan fault.'-* The author of the memoir and map 
on this area was certainly not suspicious of the ideas of wliich I am now un- 
burdening my mind; on the contrary, he attempted and, with apoloo-ies, failed 
to reconcile his facts to views then being pushed by tlie weight of '"authority ' 
in Europe. This was not the last time that facts established in India were 
found (to use a field-geologist's term) unconformably to lie on a basement of

PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 357 

geological orthodoxy as determined by authority in Europe. It is important 
to notice that the series of faults referred to in the central parts of India are 
not mere local dislocations, but have a general trend for more than 250 miles. 

A fault must 'be younger, naturally, than the strata which it traverses, but 
how much younger can seldom be determined. Intrusive rocks of known age are 
thus often more useful in indicating the age of the fissures through which they 
have been injected, and consequently the dykes which were formed at the time 
of the eruption of the great Deccan Trap give another clue to tlie direction 
(if stresses at this critical time, that is towards the end of the Cretaceous 
period, when the northerly creejj had reached its maximum, just before Gond- 
wanaland was broken up. If, now, we turn to the geological maps of the northern 
part of Central India, the Central Provinces, and Bengal, we find that the old 
Vindhyan rocks of the Narbada valley were injected with hundreds of trap- 
dykes which show a general W.S.VV.-E.N.E. trend, and thus parallel to the 
normal tension faults, which we know were formed during the periods pre- 
ceding the outburst of the Deccan Trap. This general trend of faults and 
basic dykes is indicated on many of the published geological maps of India 
covering the northern part of the peninsula, including Ball's maps of the 
Ramgarh and Bokaro coalfields ^^ and of the Hutar coalfield,^" Hughes' Rewa 
Gondwana basin, ^' Jones' southern coalfields of the Satpura basin, ^- and Oldham's 
general map of the Son Valley.^" 

We see, then, that the development of fissures with a general east-west 
trend in the northern part of Gondwanaland culminated at the end of the 
Cretaceous period, when they extended down, probably, to the basic magma 
lying below the crust either in a molten state, or in a state that would result 
in fluxion on the relief of pressure. That the molten material came to the 
surface in a superheated and liquid condition is shown by the way in which 
it has spread out in horizontal sheets over such enormous areas. Throughout 
this great expanse of lava there are no certain signs of volcanic centres, no 
conical slopes around volcanic necks; and one might travel for more than 4tKj 
miles from Poona to Nagipur over sheets of lava which are still practically 
horizontal. There is nothing exactly like this to be seen elsewhere to-day. 
The nearest approach to it is among the Hawaiian calderas, where the highly 
mobile basic lavas also show the characters of superfusion, glowing, according 
to J. D. Dana,^* with a white heat, that is, at a temperature not less than about 
1,300°C. 

Mellard Reade has pointed out that the Earth's cru.st is under conditions of 
stress analogous to those of a bent beam, with, at a certain depth, a ' level of 
no strain.' Above this level there should be a shell of compression, and under 
it a thicker shell of tension. The idea has been treated mathematically by C. 
Davison, G. H. Darwin. 0. Fisher, and M. P. Rudski, and need not be discussed 
at present. Professor R. A. Daly has taken advantage of this view concerning 
the distribution of stresses in the crust to explain the facility for the injection 
of dykes and batholiths from the liquid, or potentially liquid, gabbroid magma 
below into the shell of tension.'^ He also shows that the injection of large 
bodies of basic material into the shell of tension tends on purely mechanical 
grounds to the formation of a depression, or geosyncline. If this be so, are we 
justified in assuming that the heavy band following the southern margin of the 
Gangetic geosyncline is a ' range ' of such batholiths ? The idea is not entirely 
new ; for 0. Fisher made tiie suggestion more than twenty years ago that the 
abnormal gravity at Kalianpur was due to 'some peculiar influence (perhaps of 
a volcanic neck of basalt).'^"

Daly's suggestion, however, takeii into account with the history of Gondwana 
land, may explain the peculiar alignment of the heavy subterranean band, 
parallel to the Gangetic depression and parallel to the general trend of the 
peninsular tension-faults and fissures that followed the unloading of Gondwana- 
land and the heavy loading of the adjoining ocean bed along a band roughly 
parallel to the present Himalayan folds. 

E. S. Woodward objected that isostasy does not seem to meet the requirements 
of geological continuity, for it tends rapidly towards stable equilibrium, and the 
crust ought therefore to reach a stage of repose early in geologic time." If the 
process of denudation and rise, with adjoining deposition and subsidence, 
occurred ou a solid globe, this objection might hold good. But it seems to me 
that the break-up of Gondwanaland and the tectonic revolutions that followed 
show how isostasy can defeat itself in the presence of a sub-crustal magma 
actually molten or ready to liquefy on local relief of pressure. It is possible 
that the protracted filing off of Gondwanaland brought nearer the surface 
what was once the local level of no-strain and its accompanying shell of tension. 

The conditions existing in northern Gondwanaland before late Mesozoic times 
must have been similar to those in south-west Scotland before the occurrence 
of the Tertiary eruptions, for the crust in this region was also torn by stresses 
in the S.W.-N.E. direction with the formation of a remarkable series of 
N.W.-S.E. dykes which give the one-inch geological maps in this region a 
regularly striped appearance. 

There is no section of the Earth's surface which one can point to as being 
now subjected to exactly the same kind and magnitude of treatment as that to 
which Gondwanaland was exposed for long ages before the outburst of the Deccan 
Trap; but possibly the erosion of the Brazilian highlands and the deposition of 
the silt carried down by the Amazon, with its southern tributaries, and by the 
more eastern Araguay and Tocantins, may result in similar stresses which, if 
continued, will develop strains, and open the way for the subjacent magma to 
approach the surface or even to become extravasated, adding another to the 
small family of so-called fissure-eruptions. 

The value of a generalisation can be tested best by its reliability as a ba.«is 
for i^rediction. Nothing shows up the shortcomings of our knowled£;e about the 
state of aifairs below the superficial crust so effectually as our inability to make 
any useful predictions about earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. For many 
years to come in this department of science the only worker who will ever 
establish a claim to be called a prophet will be one in Cicero's sense — ' he who 
guesses well.'

grown by a network of roots and rootlets of millions of plants, which bind 
together the small particles and protect them against wind and rnnning water. 

In arid regions, where the rain is not sufficient to form perennial rivers, 
and where the vegetation forms isolated patches in the barren country, every 
particle of soft or disintegrated rock is quickly taken away by the wind or the 
occasional rainfall. Therefore the general denudation of the land is very 
powerful. The Egyptian monuments, exposed during 4,000 years to the disinte- 
grating and denuding powers of the desert, offer beautiful examples of the 
different kinds of dry disintegration, and many of them show very clearly also 
tlie transporting effect of the wind. 



3. The. CUmalic CondUlonR of the Earhj Prr.-Ciniihrian . 
By Professor A. P. Coleman, F.E.S. 

Our knowledge of the later Pre-Cambrian permits us to speak of desert 
conditions in the Keweenawan or Torridonian and of an ice age followed by a 
cool climate in the Huronian, but little evidence has been given as to earlier 
climates. Recent work in Canada shows that the Sndbury series, of Pre- 
Laurentian age and very much older than the Huronian, includes all types of 
sediments, often well enough preserved to show cross bedding, ripple marks, and 
annual layers indicating the change of seasons. They must have been formed 
near the margin of a continent where granites weathered under a cool and 
moist climate. They seem to be delta materials deposited by great rivers. 

The highly metamorphosed sediments of the still older Grenville and 
Kcewatin series (Lowisian?) have lost their original structures, but the gneisses, 
quartzitos, and marbles must have been clay, sand, and limestone in the 
l&gt;eginning, and the graphite may have originated in pla'nts. Land siirfaces must 
have been attacked by water and air to produce these materials, and there is no 
evidence that the climate was hot. These are the earliest-known formations, so 
that air and water worked in the usual way at the beginning of recorded 
geological time. 



4. Vicloriaii Graptoliies. By T. S. Hall, M.A., D.Sc. 

The Silurian and Ordovician graptolite-bearing rocks of Victoria occupy 
about 20,000 square miles, and over a hundred species have been recorded. 

Very little is known of the Silurian. The Ordovician is divided into Upper 
and Lower, but probably represents a continuous series. The Upper is charac- 
terised by the presence of Dicranograptida?. No zonal work has been done in 
the field, though collections yielding about fifty recorded species have been made. 

Four divisions are recognised in the Lower Ordovician, namely, Darriwillian, 
Castlemainian, Cendigonian, and Lancefieldian, at the base. There are several 
subdivisions of these formations. The characters were briefly indicated in 
the 'Geological Magazine' by the author in 1899. Subsequent work by T. S. 
Hart, F.G.S., at Daylesford has confirmed the sequence established. Large 
collections made by the Survey at many localities have somewhat extended our 
knowledge of the fauna and its distribution, but without adding any features 
of great importance. 

The Upper Ordovician ranges north from Eastern Victoria for 300 miles 
into New South Wales. In New Zealand Lancefieldian occurs at Preservation 
Inlet, and two Castlemaine zones occur as well. It is probable that the Victorian 
sequence, and not the British as stated, will be found. 

Broadly, the sequence of Australian graptolites agrees with the European, 
but in details is closer to that of New York, as Euedemann has pointed out. 
The important differences in the range of DidipnograjJtus bifidvs. 1). caduccu-f. 
D. iiirliohoni. Loganograptiis, Clovagraptus rigidvs, and some other genera and 
species negative the idea that graptolite zones are world-wide, and as no one 
believes that all genera and species originated in one loralit\- and radiated thence 
this is what we should expect.

5. On the Tertiary Alkali Rocks of Victoria. 
By Professor Ernest W. Skeatr, D.Sc. 

From INIount Leinster in Benambra, Frenchman's Hill near Omeo, and Noyang 
in Dargo, three areas in Eastern Victoria, the late Dr. Howitt (1) described 
igneous rocks which belong to the alkali series. They were all regarded by 
Hiowitt as of Palaeozoic age. The age of the rocks of Noyang, which consist 
mainly of intrusions and lava-flows of quartz-ceratophyre, has not been closely 
investigated and may be Palreozoic. Recent work (2), however, has shown, 
especially in the case of the Omeo rocks, that they are probably of mid- or even 
of late-Tertiary age. The alkali rocks of Frenchman's Hill, described by 
Howitt as intrusive orthophyres, consist really in the main of lava-flows of 
anoi-thoclase trachj'te which has a very scoriaceous margin to the flows. There 
is a central plug of a coarser quartz-bearing rock allied to s61v.sbergite and a 
more or less radial .system of dykes which are principally trachytic in character. 
Some, however, contain quartz, one at least is a bostonite, and six or seven prove 
to be dykes of nepheline-phonolite. The district is one which has been affected 
by a succession of elevatory movements of the plateau type since the mid-Tertiary 
period, and, according to UrifRth Taylor (3), a more or less meridional Senknngs- 
feld runs through the Omeo district a few miles east of Frenchman's Hill. The 
rock.s of Mount Leinster in ]jenambra consist principally of s61v.=;bergil.es. bos- 
tonites, and pyroclastic rocks of alkali trachyte. Petrologically and chemically 
many of the rocks of Mount Leinster and of Frenchman's Hill closely resemble 
some of the alkali rocks of Mount IMacedon, and, like them, are probably of mid- 
Tertiary age. The district has been elevated at intervals c'uring the Tertiary 
jieriod, but physiographically has not been closely studied. 

About fourteen miles north-east from IMansfield in north-central Victoria and 
about three miles from Tolmie, in the Tolmie Highlands, there occurs a volcanic 
hill, known locally as Gallows Hill, which has recently been shown to consist of a 
volcanic centre of probably late Tertiary age and to consist of lava-flows of 
nepheline-phonolite. From a locality near Barwite, east of Mansfield, another 
nepheline-phonolite has been found, but its field relations are at present uncer- 
tain and no account of either of these rocks has yet been published. Fenner (4) 
has recently shown that block elevation and depression have affected the Mans- 
field area in recent geological times, and that Gallows Hill lies near one of the 
fault scarps. 

The best-known area of alkali rocks in Victoria is the Mount Macedon district, 
about forty miles north-west of ]\Ielbourne (5). The series is of mid-Tertiary 
to late-Tertiary age, and the rock .sequence from below upwards, while not always 
demonstrable, appears to be as follows : — Anorthoclase trachyte, solvsbergite, 
anorthoclase basalt, macedonite, woodendite, anorthoclase-olivine-trachyte, 
olivine-anorthoclase-trachyte, limburgite. Immediately succeeding these alkali 
rocks come lava-flows of normal basalt and of andesitic basalt. The new types 
macedonite and woodendite contain over 1 per cent, of PoO^, and are related to 
the orthoclase-basalts and to the mugearites. 

While this part of Victoria shows evidence by the existence of more than one 
elevated peneplain of successive movements of the plateau type, no definite 
evidence of faulting or differential movement has been recognised in the district. 
In the western district of Victoria more or less extensive lava-flows of anortho- 
clase-trachyte occur near Coleraine, Carapook, &amp;c. (6). Generally the trachytes 
appear to be older than the newer basalts, but near Coleraine a dyke of trachyte 
penetrates a small hill composed of a basic rock resembling olivine-basalt, while 
at the Hummocks north of Casterton another trachyte dyke similarly penetrates 
a vent or small flow of olivine-basalt. Among the ejected blocks from the 
earlier members of the Pleistocene newer basalts of Lake Bullenmerri, near 
Camperdown, are some consisting of essexite and containing analcite. In the 
western district of Victoria clear evidence of comparatively recent elevatory 
movements is noticeable. No definite faults have yet been proved, however, 
and the normal basalts are much more widely spread than the alkali rocks. In 
view of Harker's generalisation as to the close correspondence between the occur- 
rence of alkali rocks and elevatory movements of the plateau type, generally 
accompanied by faulting, the above reference to earth movements is pertinent. 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C. 361 

Practically no folding movements are known among the Tertiary rocks of 
Victoria, while plateau movements, generally of elevation, sometimes of depres- 
sion and accompanied by faulting, are widespread. Near Omeo and Mansfield, 
where faulting has been demonstrated or inferred, the highly alkaline types of 
nepheline-phonolite are developed, but the widespread plateau movements in 
Victoria are more specially associated with the occurrence of the normal basalts. 
The alkali trachytes and allied rocks are intercalated between an older and a 
newer basalt series, are developed only sporadically at certain centres, and as at 
Macedon are closely associated in the field with the newer basalts as rocks of 
.slightly greater antiquity but belonging to the same volcanic period.

6. On ihe Orlgiu and Relationship of the Victorian Kaino:?oic Alkali 
Rocks. By H. S. Summers, D.Sc. 

Alkali rocks of Kainozoic age occur in Victoria in the Macedon District, near 
Coleraine and Carapook in the We.stern District, and in the neighbourhood of 
Omeo and Mansfield in North-Eastern Victoria. Ejected blocks from the vol- 
canoes near Camperdown have been described as essexite, and a similar type, 
also probably ejected, has been found near Kyneton. With the exception of 
the occurrences of Omeo and Mansfield all these alkali rocks are closely associated 
with the Upper Kainozoic calcic basalts, and the field relations are such that 
there is little doubt that the alkali rocks and the basalts are genetically related. 

Numerous analyses (mainly unpublished) have been made of Victorian basalts, 
and these show that they are fairly normal in composition, and consequently 
should belong to Harker's Calcic or Pacific Branch of Igneous rocks, whereas the 
solvsbergites, trachytes, &amp;c., of Macedon, the phonolites of Omeo and.Rfansfield, 
the essexites ( ?) of Camperdown and Kyneton, and the trachytes and anortho- 
clase-basalts of the Coleraine area must be placed in the Alkali or Atlantic 
Branch. 

It follows then that the evidence of the Victorian Kainozoic rocks does not 
support Harker's generalisation on Petrographic Regions. 

A number of first-class analyses has been made of the principal types of the 
Macedon series, and variation diagrams based on these analyses have been drawn. 
(See ' Bulletin of the Geol. Survey of Victoria,' No. 24, 1912, and ' Proceedings 
of the Royal Society of Victoria,' vol. xxvi. (N.S.), pt. ii. 1914.) 

It was found that by re-calculating the analyses to 100 per cent, with the 
water omitted and the ferric oxide reduced to ferrous, the curves obtained were 
better than those plotted from the original analyses. 

Certain of the analyses did not conform to the curves, and at first these were 
regarded as representing hybrid types, but additional work showed that they 
represented complementary tyi^es and resulted from the splitting up of a magma 
instead of the mixing of magmas. 

Some analyses have been made of the alkali rocks from other Victorian areas, 
but not a sufficient number to show the relation-ship of the various types to one 
another. 



362 TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION C. 

The cnnclusions are that the Kainozoic alkali rocks of Victoria are derived 
from the calcic basalts by differentiation, giving rise to several lesser magma 
reservoirs. 

In the case of the Macedon magma further differentiation took place and a 
series of lavas was extruded which in general showed a serial relationship, but 
some complementary to one another.

1. The Permian Breccia of llie Midland Coiinlies of Briiain, a Dcscrl 
Formaiion. B\j H. T. Ferrar, M.A., F.G.S.^ 

During the meeting of the Association at Birmingham last year members of 
this Section had an ample opportunity for visiting the chief exposures of tJie 
so-called Permian breccia of the midland counties of England. This deposit may 
be briefly described as a mass of sandstones and marls with occasional .sheets of 
angular breccia, the latter consisting in a large measure of volcanic rocks, grits, 
slates, and limestones which can be identified with rocks on the borders of 
Wales. The organic remains which have been recorded are few, but such as 
occur are indicative chiefly of terrestrial surfaces. 

Tlie origin of the breccia has given rise to many speculations, amongst whicli 
may 1)3 mentioned : — ■ 

(1) Murchison (1839) regarded it as a volcanic or trappoid breccia marking 
the position of underground masses of volcanic rocks hidden under a cover of 
their own fragments. 

(2) Ramsay (1855) ascribed its origin to the existence of glacial conditions in 
Permian times. 

(3) Geikie (1892) says with regard to Scotland that the breccia has evidently 
accumulated in small lakes or narrow fiords during periods of great and rapid 
denudation following uplift of the Upper Carboniferous rocks. 

(4) Bonney (1902) concludes that breccias are usually indicative of continental 
conditions, but that glaciers are necessary for the transport of the larger boulders. 

(5) Lapworth (1912) holds that thej' are the memorials of local Alpine 
conditions. 

In Egypt a chain of fold-mountains forms the watershed between the Nile and 
the Red Sea, and the mountains are intersected and drained by steep-sided 
gorges or wadis. The climate is arid with occasional heavy thunderstorms 
causing temporary torrents, which sweep forw^ard all rock-material loosened during 
the prevailing dry climate. The wadi bed.s receive continuously a fresh supply 
of angular debris shed from the adjacent bare hillsides, and any fragments 
which may have become rounded or subangular are often sh.attered before the 
next flood sweeps them forward another stage on their journey towards a more 
permanent re.';ting-place, namely, the alluvial plain at the wadi-mouth. Blocks 
slipping down the bare hil].?)des become scratched or they may be scratched by 
mutual impact during a sudden rush of flood-water. Great blocks are often 
carried fifty or one hundred miles down the wadi channels, and the agency of 
ice need not be invoked to explain their transport. 

The valley-fiU of most wadis in the Eastern Desert of Egj'pt is an uncon- 
solidated breccia so similar to the breccia exposed on Ley Hill, near Birming- 
ham, that there is little room for doubt that the two originated under similar 
climatic conditions.

2. Note on the Occurrence of Loess-deposits in Egypt and its Bearing 
on Change of Climate in recent Geological Times.^ By H. T. 
Ferrae, M.A., F.G.S. 

At a recent meeting of the Association Dr. Hume and Mr. Craig submitted 
the view that there had been no change, except that of gradual desiccation, in 
recent geological times in Egypt. Since their paper was published, evidence 
that the change of climate has not been uniform has been recorded from neigh- 
bouring countries. The following short paper is intended to show how teolian 
desertic deposits may be interstratified between freshwater beds without any 
change of climate. 

In the northern delta of Egypt are great stretches of flat land a few feet 
above sea-level. These areas are covered by ordinary Nile alluvium and 
remain damp during the winter months but dry in summer. Owing to the 
evaporation which takes place during the spring and early summer, soluble salts 
accumulate at or near the surface of the soil rendering it incoherent and 
powdery. Winds are now able to lift and transport this material until it is 
arrested by the roots of halophyte plants or other obstacles. Here also are 
deposited the dead shells of helices, and occasionally also the remains of land 
animals, such as the jackal, rat, bird, lizard, or snake, which have been seen 
frequenting dust-dune areas. In fact, the dust dunes of northern Egypt, known 
as Kardud to the inhabitants, are local deposits of Loess. 

A depression of the land of only a few feet, and such as that which has 
taken place since Roman times in Egypt, would cause another tluviatile layer 
containing the common shell Cyrciia fluminalis or a lacustrine bed to be 
superimposed upon them. It is thus manifest that a desertic deposit inter- 
stratified between two freshwater beds is not necessarily a proof of change of 
climate. 



3. Disciissio)i on the Plujsiographij uf Arid Lands. 

Introduction. By Professor Sir T. H. Holland, K.C.LE., D.Sc, 

F.R.S. 

Tlie principal defect in published accounts of the physiography of arid lands 
is due to the absence of data showing the amount as well as the kind of 
physical changes in progress. This deficiency is to be expected. Few qualified 
observers are able to study arid lands for long continuous periods ; such regions 
are thinly populated, and, from an economic point of view, their problems are 
of relatively small importance. It is not surprising, therefore, that, while 
we have abundant illustrations — pictorial and literary — regarding the nature of 
geological phenomena in the desert, we are only to a limited extent able to 
substantiate by trustworthy figures our general conclusions regarding the rates 
of destruction, transportation, and reproduction of desert formations. 

The investigation made during the years 1903-08 of the salt resources of the 
Rajpu,tana desert was undertaken on behalf of the Government of India with 
a definite economic object in view, and the opportunity was turned to account 
to make a quantitative test of one phase of desert phenomena — namely, the 
;eolian transportation of salt in the form of fine dust." 

There are several intermittent saline lakes lying in depressions on the sand- 
covered highlands of Rajputana. In one case — namely, the Sambhar Lake — the 
underlying silt, tested to a depth of twelve feet over an area of 68 square miles, 
was found to contain some fifty-five million tons of sodium chloride. The 
quantities of salt so stored are altogether in excess of tlie amount that could be 
accumulated by normal fresh-water rivers acting within any reasonable geological 
period under present physiographic conditions. There are no rock-salt deposits 
known within the region under consideration, and the undeilying rocks are 
Archieau gneisses and schists covered with a thin mantle of sand.

364 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C, 

The discovery of small undamaged foraminifera in the desert sands of 
Barmer and Bikaner by Mr. T. H. D. La Touche ' gave the first clue to the origin 
of this salt, for such foraminifera must have reached the heart of the desert 
by wind transportation over a distance of some five hundred miles from the 
coast of iCutch. Consideration of the meteorological conditions of the area 
increased the jjlausibility of this suggestion ; for during the hot dry season, 
from April to June, strong winds blow from the south-west, sometimes with the 
force of gales, especially during the day-time, when, under a scorching sun, 
the salt is absolutely dry and easily powdered. The Rann of Cutch during the 
hot dry season partly dries up and becomes covered with a thin incrustation 
of salt, so that every traveller — man or beast — crushes the hopper-shaped 
skeleton crystals of sodium chloride, forming puffs of fine saline dust, which 
are wafted away by the strong winds to the north-east and towards the desert 
region of Rajputana. During the hot dry season these winds maintain a con- 
stant direction; they are strong during the day, moderating to a comparative 
calm at nights, but there is never a set-back, and they are followed every year 
by the rainy season, which commences about the middle of June. 

These winds are specially strong near the coast, but they diminish in force 
in the central part of the desert region, and there their load of saline dust 
becomes deposited over the surface of the sand, being washed in solution into 
convenient hollows during the rainy season, thus forming small lakes, which 
become rapidly reduced to bodies of concentrated brine during the next follow- 
ing dry cold weather. 

During the cold weather which follows the rainy season the atmosphere is 
dry, and winds blow generally from the north and north-east. These winds 
are, however, comparatively feeble, and in any case are unable to carry an 
appreciable quantity of salt back to the south-west, as the salt is by then 
accumulated in the lakes, which are seldom completely dry before the com- 
mencement of the next following hot weather, when the recurring south-west 
winds bring in another load of salt-dust. 

By the elimination of all other possible sources of the salt in the lakes of 
the Rajputana highlands, and by consideration of the meteorological conditions, 
a satisfactory theory thus became established to account qualitatively for the 
origin of the salt. It then became necessary to check the theory by a quanti- 
tative test, and this onerous task was undertaken by Dr. W. A. K. Christie, 
with the assistance of M. Viuayak Rao, of the Geological Survey of India, 
during the hot weather of 1908. After some months of preliminary experiments 
with artificial winds to Hscertain the best method of collecting samples and of 
determining the limits of experimental error, a laboratory was built in the 
desert, where anemometer records, temperatures, and baronietic pressures were 
taken at regular and frequent intervals, while samples of the wind were 
collected at different elevations and analysed. As a result of this work, it was 
found that during four months of the hot dry season of 1908 the amount of 
wind-borne salt passing a- front 300 kilometres broad and 100 metres high must 
have been something of the order of 130,000 tons. As the meteorological 
records showed that the hot weather of 1908 was a season of unusually weak 
winds, the figure obtained is probably well below the annual average influx of 
salt-dust. 

Although the results can thus be stated in figures, they refer to one year 
only, and are, in a sense, still only of qualitative value. There is no doubt, 
however, that they establish beyond reasonable doubt the theory which had 
been formulated on wider considerations, both negative and positive, as to the 
origin of the enormous quantities of salt now accumulated in the Rajputana 
desert. 

It is necessary, naturally, to exercise caution in extending this theorv to 
other desert regions, some of which are, nevertheless, areas of wind inflow 
during hot dry seasons. It is also significant that rock-salt deposits are 
frequently associated with formations that can best be accounted for as due to 
desert conditions, although such phenomena would be characteristic also of

areas wlioro. as in the case of the Kara Roghaz nf the Casjiian, anus of the 
sea are partly cut off and suhjected to dp'sircation. 

Althongli it is dangerous to generalise from this single instance of Rajputana, 
in spite of its striking and conclusive character, the observations made in that 
region are quoted as an instance of an attempt to check by definite quantitative 
tests general mental impressions of geological dynamics in desert regions. The 
object of this communication is mainly to urge the further institution, where 
practicable, of such tests of current theories regarding the physiographic 
phenomena of arid lands. 

Professor W. M. Davis : My interest in the subject proposed for our discus- 
sion comes from an endeavour to systematise the study of land forms, so that 
a well-trained explorer shall be aided in making accurate and complete observa- 
tions of the ground, and in preparing afterwards for readers as expert as 
liimself a complete and intelligible record of his observations. It would be 
comparatively easy to reduce such a description to simpler or shorter form for 
more elementary or more popular use; but it would be impossible to expand 
a short elementary account intended for beginners, or a popular account 
intended for general readers, into a detailed monograph intended for experts. 
The advancement of geographical science will therefore be best promoted by 
striving to develop a mature thoroughgoing method for the observation and 
description of all kinds of land forms, including those of deserts. 

Much assistance has been given to the study of land forms in general by 
working out their evolution as dependent (1) on their structure, (2) on the 
erosional process that works upon them, and (3) on the stages which the forms 
produced by the work of process on structure pass through, from the initial 
stage introduced by the movement of a land mass into a new attitude, to the 
ultimate stage when the process concerned has done all its work. 

If we classify what has already been accomplished in this direction with 
respect to the erosional processes involved, it appears that the theoretical 
sequence of changes determined by the action of ordinary or normal processes 
on various structures has been worked out with encouraging success, and 
verified by confrontation with many examples of actual forms. The explana- 
tory method of describing land forms, based on this theoretical sequence, is 
now employed by a number of geographers. The same is true of marine erosional 
processes and of solutional processes. It is less true of glacial processes, though 
much good progress has been made in that division of the general subject. 

Witli regard to arid processes, theory has outstripped observation ; hence the 
observational study of deserts is much to be desired as a means of testing, 
correcting, and extending the theory of arid erosion. The difficulty with the 
descriptions of desert forms hitherto published is that they are so largely 
empirical and so incomplete that it is impossible to translate them into the 
phrases of rational or explanatory physiography. Hence what we now need 
is, the exploration of deserts by trained student.s, well informed regarding 
modern physiographic theories. • 

Let me illustrate this by a special case. The theory of the evolution of desert 
forms includes a stage in which a lower basin is about to capture the centripetal 
wash of a neiglibouring higher basin; and another stage in which such a capture 
has recently taken place. The significant characteristics of each of these two 
stages, as well as of many earlier and later stages, have been defined with 
sufficient detail to make their recognition easy, provided that the observer is 
familiar with them ; but it would be as unlikely that an observer untrained in 
physiography would see and describe the essential features of these stages of 
desert forms as that an observer untrained in botany would see and describe 
the essential features of plant forms. If one looks through various accounts of 
desert exploration, it is usually impossible to determine whether actual 
examples of imminent or of recent basin capture.s — or of any other speiial 
features of desert evolution — actually occur. 

Tlie most helpful suggestion that I can offer in this connection is that the 
effort should be made to refer every element of desert topography first to 
its proper place with respect to the surrounding contemporary elements in the 
general woiking of the processes of desert erosion, and, second, to its firoper 



366 TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION C. 

place in tlie long succession of earlier and later forms between which it stands ; 
for when the elements of a desert landscape are thus seen to be related to many 
other elements, all systematically disposed in time and place, their observation 
and their description are greatly facilitated. 

The equipment of an explorer of deserts with a good knowledge of the 
theory of desert evolution is therefore, as I see it, about as important as his 
equipment with good horses or camels, if it be desired that he should come 
back from his work with a critical record of what he has seen. 

Professor J. W. Gregory remarked that though Scott and R. L. Stevenson 
used the term desert in its old sense for any uninhabited land, at present the 
word is restricted to lands uninhabited owing to their arid climate. No 
numerical limit of desert can be given ; and, as Walther has stated, desert can- 
not be absolutely defined on biological, morphological, or climatic grounds. The 
cause of desert is not only climatic ; geological and geographical structure are 
both also influential; countries of permeable or friable rocks, and existing as a 
plateau with an easy drainage to the adjacent lowlands, are easily rendered 
desert. The climatic influence depends more on the complex conditions which 
govern the utilisation of the rain and not on its total amount. Proximity to the 
sea is consistent with the development of desert conditions. 

Desert is often more easily utilised than at first appears possible; since the 
soils often contain such rich accumulations of plant foods that the land is very 
fertile when watered. Australian soils often need the addition of phosphate, 
since they contain less phosphorus than the amount held by some authorities lo 
be necessary for profitable cultivation. 

He thought that the only explanation of tlie low phosphorus content in 
Australian soils and the absence of the usual enrichment of phosphorus in the 
soil as compared with the subsoil is that proposed by Professor Cherry, wlio 
attributes these facts to the rarity of mammals in Australia. In some cases in 
Australia the poverty of phospha'te has been more influential than the aridity 
in developing desert conditions. 

Professor A. Penck : Deserts are regions of the globe which are not only dry 
but are characterised also by the want of vegetation. Taking such adefinition, 
Australia has only very few deserts ; most of what is called Australian desert, 
indeed, has scrub, even timber. The surface forms of the deserts are more 
closely controlled by water than by wind. The latter heaps up the dimes, but 
its erosive action is rather insignificant in comparison with waterwork exercised 
after rare local rain-showers. Besides this, the surface of many parts of our 
deserts has been shaped by water before the desert conditions came in. But 
there are deserts which have been deserts for a very long period. There has 
been since the end of the Tertiary period a repeated shifting of the climatic 
belts of the earth, which can be observed especially at the equatorial and polar 
border of the desert belts, but from the central parts the belt was not shifted 
away. 

Mr. Griffith Taylor : The arid region which I know best is situated in 
78° South latitude, but I propose also to discuss the central arid region in 
Australia. 

In Antarctica are many features which closely resemble those described from 
the desert. Angular breccias are being formed abundantly along the facets of 
all the glacier "valleys in 78° S. Dreikanter are numerous. Stripe are almost 
absent over miles and miles of moraine. The difficulty of determining the 
origin of such deposits in fossil condition is obvious. 

Professor Gregory has always taken an optimistic view of our own arid 
region, perhaps I am less sanguine. It behoves us thoroughly to realise the great- 
ness of the problem seeing that approximately one million square miles has less 
than 10 inches of rainfall. Our visitors who have just seen the region in Western 
Australia have only penetrated the southern fringe. Moreover, 10 inches of rain 
in the south mean infinitely more than in the north where evaporation is so 
great. ... 

I hope to see a physiographic survey along the 10-inch isohyet initiated, to 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C. 367 

determine if there be a distinct dift'ercncc such as Goyder demonstrated in so 
masterly a manner as a safe wheat line (near 13 inches) in iSouth Australia. Only 
by such necessary research can we really gain adequate knowledge of the 
potentialities of Australia. 

Mr. E. J. Andrews : The observations of the writer in lands of sub-arid, or 
arid, character have been made only iu Eastern Australia and in Arizona, 
Nevada, and California in the United States. In these regions the surface 
forms testify to the dominating influence of stream action and to the utterly 
subordinate action of the wind iu sculpturing the lands. To appreciate the 
part taken in the actual sculpture of desert lands by wind action alone, it is 
necessary to recognise the fact that ordinary water streams produce pecidiar 
forms, and that these forms are not the result of the stream activity durhig 
normal periods, but only during periods of great Hoods acting perhaps once in 
a decade. Such forms, however, are continuously mistaken for those due to 
wind action, by various observers, and from interpretations such as these the 
action of the wind as an eroding agent is magnified unduly. 

The thalwegs of the Australian and American valleys commence in ^vell- 
nuirked divides, and their slopes thence decrease continuously towards base- 
level. Tributary thalwegs also enter the main valleys at accordant slopes. 
The bases of these valleys are occupied by pebbles and boulders, while these 
again are covered with deposits of clay and sand. Moreover, certain plants 
characteristic of fah'ly humid conditions elsewhere occur sporadically in oases 
in Eastern Australia within sub-arid regions, and this evidence taken as a 
whole indicates a very recent decrease in the amount of precipitation in drier 
Eastern Australia. Kuch action has only slightly modified the general appear- 
ance of theland forms developed in a previous cycle, save for killing off much of 
the vegetation of that previous cycle. 

Mr. A^ L. Du Torr referred to the dry region of German South- West Africa 
and the Kalahari. In the coastal sandy wastes, though wind etching is conspicu- 
ous, no hollows due to the action of the wind are to be found. Inland, hollows 
called ' pans,' often saline and usually periodically filled, occur sunk below the 
general surface, and must have been produced by wind erosion. All kinds of 
pans, from 'living' to 'fossil,' can be found, just as in the case of the sand 
dunes. 

Mr. A. T. Ke.nyo.v : The general trend of the speakers' remarks showed that 
desert or ratlicr arid occurrences were distinctly local, and no generalisation 
could now bo made. The area in Victoria which might be called arid was only 
so on account of its rainfall, which averaged about 14 inches. Its vege- 
tation was abundant. No definition of desert had yet been made which was 
really applicable to it. 

Tlie reference to Goyder's rainfall line, which was undoubtedly fixed by tho 
occurrences of salsolaccous vegetation, needed some comment. Salt bushes 'grow 
on soils suitable to their demands, and rainfall was only a small factor. The 
southern limits of Hcteiodcndron oltdfolium, which agreed with the line of 
distnict change from the Buloka or hybrid type of Bdar to its typical form, 
was a more reliable guide; but profitable agriculture had long passed even that 
limit. 

In regard to Victorian Mallee saline occurrences, these undoubtedly were 
confined to the lowest trough of a synclinorium, and were the exposed surfaces 
of underground sheets of salt water. This has been proved by a number of 
bores. They were also accompanied by beds or mounds of gypsum or copi as 
locally named, and lime carbonate. The artesian waters of the underlying 
marine beds held the same salts in similar proportions. 

In general, lakes or swamps, the terminals of water-courses, were fresh, 
as were also the swamps or lakes corresponding with Dr. Du Toit's pans, and 
dependent upon local catchment only for their water supply. 

in regard to sand ridges these leolian drifts occur all over Victoria in the 
western and north-eastern ]iortions, which are the most fertile parts of the 
State. In the Mallee the size and arrangement of the ridges seem to be 



308 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C. 

))arti&lt;-'ularly iiiHueiiced by tlie character of the soil. In the better parts of tlie 
Mallee, with stiff clayey 'soil, they are with difficulty describable. In the more 
sandy and medium agricultural soiLs they had a marked parallelism and were 
of moderate size, but in the sand-hill and heath country (locally known as 
desert) this parallelism was of a general character only, and the sand-hills or 
ridges were known as 'jumble.' Some of these hills were as much as two 
hundred feet in height above the surrounding surface. None could be described 
as ' dune morte,' neither was it at all evident that they were fixed or fossil dunes, 
the more likely theory being that they were still being formed by action of 
single sand-grain movements. Owing to the weather being a succession of 
cyclones there was no prevailing direction of wind, though the westerly course 
of these depressions miglit be taken as generally governing the main sweep of 
the winds. Taking this as a geneial direction the ridges run with it and not 
at right angles. 

The east winds seldom occur, but frequently are of great force; they never 
shift any sand. All other winds, particularly the north-west, w-est, and south- 
west winds, shift sand, but only in places where man has removed the natural 
protection of herbage either by clearing or cultivation or by fires occurring in 
times of drought. None of the sand shifted is air-borne, but is rolled along the 
surface of the ground. At Wirvengren Plain, the termination of the outlet 
creek or the final flow of the Wimmera River, there were in the drought of 
1902 after a bush-fire had swept over the sand-hills on the west some 500,0a&gt;,i&gt;lJU 
cubic yards of sand, or at the rate of 50,000,000 per mile in length drifted on 
to thc'plains. In the succeeding year, one of good rainfall, the herbage again 
fixed the sand-hills, while the sand on the plain gradually drifted eastwards 
until four years ago the plain was again in its original condition. Similarly 
the outlet creek itself in its course of fifty miles through white sand-hills 
retained its orighial section; the sand blown in at certain exceptional seasons 
gradually drifting out to the east. 

Supplementing Professor Gregory's remarks on the phosphoric acid contents 
of Victorian soilt it should be pointed out that the Mallee soil contained only 
about twenty parts per 100,000 or one-half of the average Victorian soil. This 
refers to the agricultural part of the IMallee, whereas in the sand-hill and heath 
country the amount of phos)ihoric acid was hardly ascertainable by chemical 
methods, and it was practically non-existent. 

The methods of farming which led to the successful occupation of all this 
country originated in South Australia over forty years ago, where the recently 
christened "dry farming' had resulted in the prosperous and productive settle- 
ment of land with under 10 inches annual rainfall. .The cost of production of 
wheat was under l.v. 6(/. per bushel, and there were at least a hundred million 
acres suitable for its cultivation. 

Dr. W. F. Hume : The characters of an ai'id land cannot be separated from 
its past history, and in Egypt five physiographic features of first importance 
have to be considered. These are : — 

1. A belt of deep depressions in the extreme west, the famous Oases. 

2. The broad waterless expanse of the Western or Libyan Desert, to the 
west of the Nile, and the corresponding limestone plateau region (the Maaza 
Limestone Plateau) to the east of the river. 

3. The Nile Valley with its Delta. 

4. The Wilderness of the Eed Sea Hills and Sinai with its rugged mountahis 
and tortuous valleys. 

5. The Red Sea and its narrow prolongations, the Gulfs of Suez and Akaba, 
together with the coastal plains. 

Each of these divisions requires separate treatment. The paper gives a rapid 
sketch of the geological history of Egypt as known to us at present, the formation 
of the ancient core of Pre-Cambrian or Palaeozoic sediments, volcanic rocks with 
invasion by granitic magmas, the brief Carboniferous marine advance, and later 
the much more important Jurassic-Cretaceous transgression, which practically 
affected almost the whole of Egypt, giving rise to the Nubian Sandstone and 
the important phosphate-bearing Cretaceous series. The Eocene strata which 
form the major portion of Central Egypt are probably formed, at the base, of 



TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION C. 369 

rc-made Cretaceous material, and only in tlieir upper portions show marked 
evidence that the underlying sandstones and igneous rocks are undergoing 
erosion. 

The re-arranging of Cretaceous strata eroded during Eocene times is regarded 
by the writer as explaining the great difficulty experienced in drawing a litho- 
logical line of unconformity between the beds of these respective periods, though 
the faunal differences indicate the great break between them. 

Fringing the i^re-Eocene and Eocene areas of Egypt are a series of Miocene 
and more recent formations which are o"f great interest both from tectonic and 
economic points of view. 

In considering the separate physiographic features it is pointed out : — 

(A) In the formation of the Oases it is necessary to consider the denudation 
of the area by marine erosion while rising from the sea and the effects of former 
more humid climatic conditions. Where the Nubian Sandstone or other soft beds 
have been exposed, as Beadnell has pointed out, the Oases depression without 
outlet is produced by wearing through wind-blown sand. 

(B) The Great Plains of the Libyan Desert are regions of low dip, of meagre 
rainfall, and thus wind is the dominant factor. A sandy region to the north 
supplies the sand necessary for erosion. The character of the desert surface 
depends on the nature of the geological strata present. The undulating gravel 
plateaux, or serir, the limestone expanse, the ' melon ' country, and the fossil 
floors are various forms in which the desert presents itself, the main feature 
being the removal of all particles capable of being transported by wind. These 
are deposited as sand-falls in the wind-shadows of the Nile Valley scarp or 
other depressions. The sand-dunes which are locally developed are in sharp 
contrast to the main desert, these probably depending on three main factors, 
the existence of sandy deposits, determining their source of origin, the usual 
direction of the wind their trend, and the relief of the ground their position. 

The Maaza Limestone Region is similar to the Libyan Desert, but has a 
greater rainfall. It thus presents a fine example of the effects when rain acts 
during short periods on rock-surfaces affected by temperature variations. Deep 
ravines, remarkable water-holes, caverns, natural bridges, and surface coloration 
films due to the trickling down of ferruginous solutions over cliff-walls are 
among the prevailing features in the southern part of this area. 

(C) The present course of the Nile Valley appears to depend on three factors : 
(a) The formation of the syncline, the axis of which it partly follows; (b) the 
erosion of the softer strata along their outcrops determining the present north- 
south trend of the major courses of the river ; and (f ) the possible effect of the 
rotation of the earth (Van Baer's law), the stream tending to hug its eastern 
bank. Attention is called to the region of exceptional erosion where heavy 
masses of Eocene limestone rest on and have slipped over the subjacent soft 
Cretaceous marls and slates. These slips must have been connected with greater 
rainfall and earth-movement as widespread terraces extend in front of the main 
cliff and rise to some 110 metres above the present river-level. The triple 
terracing of the Nile is briefly considered. 

(D) The ^Mountain Region of the Eastern Desert is essentially an anticlinal 
area, where tension is in excess of compression. The differential movements 
are considerable, minor folds play a conspicuous part, and great fractures deter- 
mine earth-features of considerable magnitude. The result is that the masses 
of granite and metamorphic rocks hidden beneath the surface in Central Egypt 
are here exposed by denudation, forming the Red Sea Hills and Sinai 
mountains. 

The different geological formations give rise to very varied surface features. 
Attention is called to the importance of rain as a sculpturing agent. The soft 
Nubian sandstone is easily eroded both by wind-borne sand and by water, giving 
rise to conspicuous depressions. In the granitic areas temperature variation 
breaks up the solid rock, huge domes are produced by flaking off of concentric 
shells. Dykes give rise to marked differences in surface outline, the harder 
quartz-porphyries determining the form and general trend of many of the 
mountain summits, while the softer diabases, being easily eroded, give rise to 
gullies seaming the precipitous sides of the granitic hills. The general character 
of the country where schists and volcanic rocks are present is also described. 

1914. B B 



370 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C. 

(E) In the Gulf of Suez area another factor has come into play. Here sea- 
arms project far inland between land-surfaces subject to desert conditions, and 
their waters become centres of far-reaching chemical activity. Thus coral-reefs 
are changed to dolomites, sea-shells of carbonate of lime to gypsum, hydro- 
carbons are in quantities of economic importance, and mineralised areas of lead 
and zinc ores, of manganese oxide, of iron pyrites, and of sulphur are present 
in the young Tertiary beds which fill these Ked Sea depressions. From Suez 
to beyond Halaib, that is, throughout the length of Egypt, gypsum forms a 
conspicuous fringe between the ancient hills and the sea, generally dipping 
gently seaward on the borders of the Red Sea itself. Further north, in the 
Gulf of Suez area, the conditions are more complicated. Dyapir, or piercing 
folds such as have been described by Professor Mrazec in Rumania, are of 
common occurrence, and there is remarkable interplay between the hard and 
soft members of the folded series. 

The surface structure of an arid land is not only the direct reflex of its 
geological structure, but also of former climatic change. Many factors in Egypt 
point to great rainfall in the past, such as gravels of igneous material in the 
Nile Valley far from their source of origin, masses of travertine in the Oases, 
the varying terraces of the Nile Valley itself, the evidence of expansive lakes 
at Kom Ombo, &amp;c. 

Though the main features of a desert land depend on the geological structure 
and in part on past climatic conditions, there are characteristics which are typical 
of all arid regions. These are far removed from the great marine areas and 
from the zone of rainfall dependent upon solar activity in lands beneath the 
tropics. 

These typical desert features have already been referred to, and include : — 

1. The sweeping of all fine material from the surfaces of the plains by the 
action of the wind, and formation of plateau summits. 

2. Intense scouring of these surfaces by wind-driven sand. 

3. The breaking up of the most solid rocks by temperature-variation. 

4. The formation of sand-dmies behind obstructions or where the relief of 
the ground favours their development. 

5. The formation of mushroom-shaped pillars, or standing-out of harder 
materials on bases undercut by the sand. 

6. The formation of sand-worn pebbles of typical angular outlines, the well- 
known Dreikante. 

7. Vermicular markings on limestones, due it may be to etching during the 
movement of evaporating saline solutions. 

8. Formation of desert-crusts by leaching out of the soluble materials con- 
tained in the rocks, with evaporation at the surface, resulting in deposition of 
the oxides of iron and manganese. Mr. Lucas, Director of the Survey Depart- 
ment Laboratory, has made a special study of these desert and river films, the 
latter probably only differing from desert ones in degree. 

9. Flaking off of surfaces in the surface zone affected by temperature varia- 
tion. Also fracture due to the same cause. Fragments of porphyry, limestone, 
&amp;c., are often split into a series of parallel flakes standing vertically, their 
original connection to one another being clearly indicated by their close juxta- 
position. 

In the half-desert where rain, though brief, is intensely active while it 
lasts, a series of interesting phenomena are presented : deep canon-like valleys, 
boulder-strewn gullies, saw-back ridges, paraUel-dyke country, saline marshes, 
dry waterfalls or steep precipices in the valley-floors, and great talus-slopes. 

Mr. Ferrak, in reply to a question asked by Professor A. P. Coleman, 
explained that the slope of the wadis from the watershed towards the Nile was 
about 1 to 1,000 and towards the Red Sea 1 to 200 or 1 to 300, but that the 
slope was of little moment, owing to the sudden rush of storm-water from its 
gathering-ground on the bare mountain-sides. He had not actually observed 
scratchings on rocks because they had not been sought, but he had seen great 
heaps of boulders in unstable equilibrium, which, if overbalanced, could not 
avoid being mutually scratched. He was aware that the scratches on some of 



TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION C. 371 

the blocks of the so-called Permian breccias were merely eroded veins or 
filaments of mineral which could be seen inside the rocks if they were broken 
across, and that there was little similarity between the wadi-breccias of Egypt 
and the moraine breccias of Antarctica. With regard to Mv. Dn Toit's remarks 
on salt-pans he agreed that dunes to leeward pointed to erosion and that there- 
fore we should expect to find a great accumulation of dunes to leeward of the 
Egyptian Oases : such accumulations are wanting. Professor Penck's observa- 
tions on the poleward movements of deserts could be interpreted in two ways : 
either the indraught of air towards the equator carried sand from temperate 
zones on to the sub-desert areas, thus rendering them essentially deserts and 
causing a poleward migration of their edges; or, and this has an important 
bearing on the size of Polar ice-caps, our earthly boiler and condensers (the 
Tropics and the Poles) are losing in efficiency, and consequently both regions 
are becoming drier. The Wastwater Screes were a known example of breccias 
forming in a region whose climate is hardly desertic. 

Mr. Ferrar said he was well aware that the Nubian Sandstone was exposed 
in the floors of the oases and that vast quantities of rock-material had been 
removed, nevertheless he still found himself in Professor Walther's position of 
ten years ago, and, after seeing wind-driven sand tending to fill the oases- 
depressions and not excavate them, did not think the wind-erosion theory con- 
sistent nor a sufficient explanation of their origin. He holds the view that 
wind-erosion tends to remove all rugosities and that the ultimate phys'iography 
of an arid land-surface is a smooth level plain. 

With regard to Sir Thomas Holland's criticism as to quantitative results, 
Mr. Ferrar suggested that data, similar to that collected in Rajputana by the 
Indian Geological Survey, could be obtained by measuring the quantity of sand 
brought in to the oases at their northern ends and the quantity carried out 
southwards. Any difference -would show the rate of erosion or deposition, 
according to sign. 

In concluding his remarks IMr. Ferrar thanked his audience for their infeiost 
in and their appreciation shown towards his papers. 

After remaiks by Mr. D. M. S. Watson, the discussion closed.

On the Age and Sequence of the Tertiary Strata of South-Eastern 
Australia. By Fredeeick Chapman, A.L.S. 

Divisions of the Kainozoic. 
It is convenient to divide the Australian Tertiary system into four or five 
main series, using the local terms suggested by Hall and Pritchard. In ascend- 
ing order, these, according to the writer, are : — 

1, Balcombian. 2, Janjukian. 3, Kalimnan. 4, Werrikooian. Above these 
conies the Pleistocene series, referred by many geologists elsewhere to a separate 
system, the Quaternary. 

These divisions, broadly speaking, correspond with : — 

1, Oligocene. 2, Miocene. 3, Lower Pliocene. 4, Upper Pliocene. 

The present writer maintains that, giving due allowance to time discrepancies 
in regard to the factor of distribution of life-forms over wide areas, guide fossils 
are probably as important in dividing and allocating these beds to the well-known 
horizons of the northern hemisphere as are percentages of living forms in these 
fossil deposits. The percentage method can only be used with safety as an 
approximate guide to age, seeing the difficulty of obtaining an agreement amongst 
zoologists as to what constitutes a species. 

The above series of European divisions correlated with the Australian 
corresponds almost exactly with McCoy's original determinations, augmented by

observations on faunas and stratigraphic relationship of the beds made by the 
writer during twelve years' attention to this subjert. 

Sequence of the Beds. 

With regard to the sequence, some Victorian authors hold the opinion that 
the Janjukian series is older than the Balcombian ; but the confusion seems to 
have arisen from the occurrence of a large number of persistent species, especially 
of mollusca, passing up from the argillaceous Balcombian into the Janjukian clay 
series. Where faunistic and stratigraphic relationships were both doubtful the 
term Barwonian was suggested, which included both Balcombian and Janjukian. 
If, however, we regard the scope of the Janjukian in its broad sense as embracing 
all phases of sedimentation, of one long time series, tlie term Barwonian is no 
longer needed, its members being included in the term Janjukian. The .sequence 
of the beds 1, 2, and 3 as given here has lately been cstabli.shed by the autlior 
from evidence obtained in cliff-seotions at Muddy Creek near Hamilton, and in 
the bores put down in the Mallee and at Sorrento. 

Other authors sime jMcCoy agreed as to the present sequence, but diffeied in 
regard to the age of the oldest beds, which they held to lielong to the Korene, 
making the succeeding beds correspondingly older. 

Guide Fo'^sih. 

The variou.s members of the Australian Kainozoic .system have been referred 
by the writer to tlie horizons given above, chiefly through a study of the cetace&lt;in 
types, the fish remains, the mollusca, the polyzoa, the ostracoda, and the 
foraminifera. In the olde.st beds (Balcombian) a predominant fossil is AmjjJiis- 
/i-f/liiii, long mistaken for XummuJili'S rririohnin, the latter genus in reality being 
absent. In the limestone phase of the succeeding Janjukian beds the Miocene 
type of toothed whale, I'liriisquaJoJon, occasionally occurs; in the marls the 
Miocene genus S/tiruIirosIra ; whilst the Bindigalian forms of Lepitlocyrlina are 
abundant in the polyzoal series of the Janjukian. In the Kalimuau series cetacea 
known elsewhere in the Pliocene Crag (Diestian and Astian) of Antwerp and 
England, as Sialdicctuit and the zi))hioid whales, are characteristic fossils. The 
above interpretation of the Australian Tertiary sediments agrees also witli the 
data acquired by Australian physiographists, and is that generally accepted for 
New Zealand and Patagonia. 

Terrestrial Series. 

The terrestrial Tertiary deposits, .so far as they are known, are assigned to the 
various horizons as follows : — 

Balcombian. — Leaf -beds of Mornington and the brown coal of the Altona Bay 
Coal-shaft. 

Janjukian. — Leaf-beds of Sentinel Rock (Cape Otway), Haddingley near 
Bacchus Mar.sh, Pitfield Plains, Narracan, Dargo High Plains and the Older 
Deep Leads : in Victoria. Leaf-beds of Dalton, Gunning, and Vegetable Creek : 
in New South Wales. Leaf-beds of Lake Frome, &amp;c. : in South Australia. 

Kalimnan. — Newer Deep Leads, Haddon, Victoria. Also of Gulgong in New- 
South Whales. 



2. The Aqe and Sequence of Ihe yiclnrian Tcrtiaries. 
' By T. S. Hall, M.A., D.Sc. 

The chief difficulty that meets one in attempting to decide the age of the 
marine Tertiaries of Southern Australia is their wealth in well-preserved fossils. 
From the oldest series, the Barwonian, which includes the closely allied 
Janjukian and Balcombian, about 1,800 species have been described. This 
includes over SCO mollusca. some 500 polyzoa, and about 40 brachiopoda, 
50 echinoids, 80 corals, and a large number of foraminifera. The Kalimnan 
yields about 260 described species, mainly mollusca, while the Werrikooian 
affords close upon 200 species of described mollusca. It may safely be said that 
when the fauna of the Barwonian, at any rate, is fully described the total will 
be doubled, for, taking the mollusca, the small forms, which are extremely 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C. 373 

abundant, have not been touched, and a large number of new species in almost 
all groups are known, but remain undiagnosed. 

The basis of classification is in dispute. In spite of all objections I adhere 
to the Lyellian percentage method as yielding the best results. Another method 
has been adopted by Ortmann in dealing with the Patagonian Tertiaries. It 
consists in comparing each species with species of known age in the northern 
hemisphere, deciding which is the nearest ' ally ' or ' representative,' and 
referring the southern formations to those northern ones which yield the greatest 
number of ' relationships.' It passes by as of no importance' all the southern 
forms. Harris suggests using phylogeny pnrj passu with the Lyellian method. 

The objection urged against the Lyellian method is that the personal equation 
enters too largely into it, and we do not know what a species is. H. von Ihering 
has discussed Ortmann's method fully, and objects to it. To my mind the 
personal equation is as prominent in it as in the Lyellian, and it demands an 
amount of knowledge of the Tertiary faunas of the world that no one can 
possibly have at first hand, and enormous collections, quantities of each species, 
that no museum is likely to contain. As regards phylogeny, we cannot use it 
till we know the sequence. 

Confining ourselves to the mollusca, we find Tate recognising about a dozen 
recent species in the Barwonian. Later authors have more or less definitely 
recognised about half a dozen more. As we have over 800 named species in this 
series of beds, we may double the number of recent ones without seriously 
affecting the result. 

Assuming that the Barwonian is Eocene, for some age has to be assumed, I 
have elsewhere discussed most of the genera that transgress.! Some pass up 
from Mesozoic times, others are extensions back from yomiger horizons in the 
north, or from recent seas. Besides this the absence of many modern genera 
must be insisted on. It is customary for those who hold that the Barwonian 
is younger than Eocene to label all the old genera 'survivals.' This hardly 
settles the question. Leaving the land fauna on one side, there are some un- 
doubted survivals in the Indo-Pacific, but it may be asked. Did nothing originate 
in the southern seas and slowly migrate northwards ? The real place of origin 
and age of the transgressing genera cannot be settled off-hand by northern 
standards. 

The Barwonian is divided into Balcombian and Janjukian, but their relation, 
.ship has been vigorously discussed. By far the greater part of the fauna is 
conmion to the two. Passing by the discussions between Professor Ralph Tate 
and Mr. J. Dennant on the one side, and Dr. G. B. Pritchard and myself on the 
other, which ended, as such discussions frequently do, in a series of flat contra- 
dictions as to facts, we may consider -Mr. F. Chapman's position. 

Mr. Chapman asserts that the Batesford limestone is typical Janjukian, and 
appears to conclude that all the polyzoal limestones, and there are many, are 
also Janjukian. He argues on the same data that the Janjukian is the younger 
series. Tate, Dennant, Pritchard, and myself, however much we differed on 
other points, agreed that the age of the limestones must be decided by reference 
to the rich fauna of the clays. Mr. Chapman makes no reference to an inter- 
calated clay bed in the Batesford limestone from which Dr. Pritchard and myself 
collected forty-five species, mainly mollusca. Of these only one is confined to the 
type Janjukian locality, while twelve have never been found there, but are 
confined to typical Balcombian beds. The rest are common to both series. 
The limestone, then, as we asserted, is Balcombian and not Janjukian. More- 
over, we showed, by a careful examination of the area, that the limestone passed 
under clays which are typically Balcombian, and can be traced to Orphanage 
Hill, only a couple of miles away. M'Coy grouped the Orphanage Hill beds 
with those of Mornington, that is, with the type Balcombian section. Tate, 
Dennant, Pritchard, and myself agree with the grouping, and Mr. Chapman 
still labels the Orphanage Hill fossils Balcombian in the National Museum. 
If, as Mr. Chapman asserts, the Batesford limestone is Janjukian, then the 
Balcombian is the younger and not the older member, as he asserts. The 
stratigraphical facts are unimpeachable. 

The !^Iount Gambler limestones must, as the contained mollusca show, be

374 TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION C. 

associated with the Balcombian of Muddy Creek. The polyzoal limestone of 
IMuddy Creek rests on quartz j)orphyry, and is the basal member of the series. 
It has been traced by Dr. Pritchard and myself passing under the more loosely 
compacted beds of the district, and is inseparable from them. 

The polyzoal limestones of Jan Juc, Waurn Ponds, and a few other places 
are Janjukian, and the evidence rests on the mollusca, but this has no bearing 
on Mr. Chapman's main contention. 

The relative age of the Janjukian and Balcombian is a difficult question. 
M'Coy, Tate and Dennant, and Chapman consider the Janjukian the younger. 
Dr. Pritchard and myself consider the reverse to be the case. 

As regards the other formations, it may be briefly said tliat the estimate of 
their age depends on that of the Barwonian. If this be Eocene, they are 
Miocene and Pliocene respectively; if not, they must be placed higher in the 
scale. 



3. On the Age and Sequence of the ^^iciorian Tertiaries. 
By G. B. Pbitchard, D.Sc. 

Tertiary geology in Souili-Eastern Australia has been fruitful of much 
difference of opinion, partly on account of lithological variations associated with 
paliBontological variations which have not always received due weight, the diffi- 
culty of correlating disconnected outcrops, bores, and shafts, and the degree of 
antiquity and relative age of the various horizons represented. The various 
changes in this work have no doubt been a stimulation to some, but to many it 
has been, and still is, very confusing. 

It happens that marine deposits are well developed, many showing a remark- 
able wealth of fossils, and these have attracted more attention than their terres- 
trial and volcanic associates. Amongst the marine fossils, mollusca are usually 
very striking, and it is only natural to compare these with Australian living 
forms. In this way a succession can be determined for the fossil faunas as at 
present known, showing further and further removes from the living. 

(a) Werrikooian. — The type locality is at Limestone Creek, a small tributary 
of the Glenelg River, in the parish of Werrikoo, South-Western Victoria. 
These beds bear a molluscan fauna strictly comparable with living forms along 
the southern coast except for the occurrence of a few species at present unknown 
amongst the living fauna. 

(b) Kalimnan. — The type locality is near the township of Kalimna, Gipps- 
land Lakes, Eastern Victoria. The fauna of these beds is also comparable in 
general facies with the recent, in the proportion of bivalves to univalves, and 
relative abundance of representatives of other groups. It includes extinct 
genera, as well as a very high proportion of extinct species. 

(c) Balcombian. — The type locality is at Balcombe's Bay, east shore of Port 
PJiillip. The fauna of these beds is richer and more varied than the existing 
Sdiithcrn fauna; its general facies is more comparable with Northern Australian 
forms. In tlie jn'esent state of our knowledge it contains ratlier more than two 
per cent, of extinct genera, and even allowing a wide margin for differences of 
opinion the living species would barely represent two per cent. 

((/) Janjukian. — ^Coastal sections on Bass Strait, parish of Jan Juc, south of 
Geelong. The fauna from these beds appears to be furthest removed from the 
living, based on a review of the genera which shows between five and six per 
cent, extinct, whilst the species only show about one per cent, living forms. 

When the typical fossils are not obtai/iable it is not easy to state whether a 
rock series is Balcombian or Janjukian. To meet this difficulty the wider term 
Barwonian has been given, as both these horizons are well developed in the 
Barwon Basin. 

Stratigraphical evidence also exists in confirmation of the above sequence in 
the Moorabool Valley, in the coastal sections from Port Campbell to Cats' Eeef 
and elsewhere.

4. On Ihc Acjd of llip, TjOiver Tertiary Marine Rochs of Austrnlin. By 

R. BuiiT.EN Newton. 

The author referred briefly to the valuable palreontological work on the 
Australian Tertiaries carried out by such prominent authors as M'Coy, Ralph 
Tate, Dennant, Hall, Pritchard, &amp;c., the majority of whom favoured an Eocene 
Age for the Lower Tertiary deposits of Australia. The late G. F. Harris 
doubted tlie existence of such a formation, whilst M. Cossmann could see no 
relationships among the Lower Tertiary Opisthobranchs from Australia with 
Eocene forms from Europe. 

Mr. F. Chapman, paleontologist of the Melbourne Museum, has studied this 
subject, and proves very conclusively that those beds hitherto regarded as 
Eocene belong to the Miocene period — a view which the author fully supports. 
Mr. Chapman's work on the Batesford limestone is important in this connection, 
because of its containing Lepidocyclina, Amjihistegina, and Litliothamniinn— 
all of which characterise the Miocene beds of Europe, Java, Sumatra, Borneo, 
Formosa, &amp;c. ; the absence of nummulites in this limestone is against its age 
being either Eocene or Oligocene. These same limestones have also yielded 
Mollusca and Brachiopoda, as well as Carcharodon megalodon, which has its 
origin in Miocene rocks. The author was of opinion that the Lower Tertiary 
faunas of Australia presented in some cases a recent facies, in others a Miocene 
facies with relationships to both European and South American species of that 
period. Among shells showing a resemblance to those of present-day seas, he 
mentioned Cassis conlusu?, Siphonalia spatiosa, Typhis lariniatus, all Tate's 
.species, and mostly from the Muddy Creek deposits; and many more species 
might be quoted exhibiting a more or less recent appearance. Among fossil 
forms more particularly referred to was the Aturin aturi var. niistralis, which 
lias been recognised as coming from the Eocene of Australia. Although given 
a varietal name, this Cephalopod is not to be separated from the Miocene sjiecies 
of Europe known as Atur.in nfuri, and with this statement Mr. Crick, of the 
British Museum, thoroughly agrees. The species is found in many of the 
Australian deposits, as also in the Table Cape beds of Tasmania, the Oamaru 
beds of New Zealand, the Navidad beds of Chili, South America, as also in the 
European IMiocene. The more or less pointed rostrum of Spirulirosfra nntn 
illustrate.? an affinity with Miocene forms rather than with Eocene, which are 
nioro obtuse. 

The largo Ci/prnrns described by M'Coy as Oligocene should more probably 
be regarded as IMioccne, since they come from the Gellibrand River Bed.s, 
Muddy Creek deposits, &amp;c., which also contain the Aturiii nturi, before men- 
tioned. The Brachiopods of the Lower Tertiary deposits of Australia show 
a somewhat recent facies, a striking form being Magellania garihaldiana — a 
species occurring in the Mount Gambler Beds in association with the 
Attn in aturi. 

Even before Mr. Chapman pointed out the Miocene characters of the Lower 
Tertiary deposits of Australia, Dr. Ortmann, of the United States, had pub- 
lished in 1902 his important monograph on the Tertiary deposits of Patagonia, 
in which he compared the faunas of that continent with those of Australia. 
His reseai'ches were against the presence of Eocene in the Tertiaries of 
Australasia, and those beds hitherto recorded as such he identified as 
Miocene, and contemporaneous with the Pareora beds of New Zealand, Navidad 
series of Chili, and the Patagonian deposits, all of which showed unmistakable 
affinities with each other and favoured the view that a former connection 
existed between South America and Australasia. 

The term Oligocene among Australasian marine Tertiaries, the author was 
inclined to abandon because of the absence of Nummulites, their place being 
taken by Amphistegina and Lepidocycline forms of Foraminifera. Such rocks 
he would regard a.s Miocene. This would apply to the Balcombian and 
Janjukian beds of Mornington &amp;c. and the older deposits of Muddy Creek and 
other localities.

5. The Correlation oj the Azistralian Marine Kainozoic Deposits — ■ 
Evidence of the Echinoids, Bryozoa, and some Vertehrates. 
By Pi-ofessor J. W. Gregoey, F.E.S. 

Correlations of the Kainozoic deposits which extend along southern Australia 
have been proposed in accordance with two main conclusions. According to 
the first, these deposits include marine representatives of all the Kainozoic 
systems from the Eocene to the Pleistocene. According to the alternative 
explanation, most of the deposits belong to the middle part of the Kainozoic, and 
include essentially one fauna. When I succeeded M'Coy in Melbourne in 1900 
I had to consider this question, and carefully examined the evidence given by 
the two groups of animals in which I was most interested, the Echinoidea and 
the Bryozoa, and also compared their evidence with that of some fossil verte- 
brates. The second correlation seemed the better to agree with the evidence of 
these groups. The Echinoidea had been regarded as indicating the Eocene age 
of some of the deposits, for one characteristic fossil had been referred to the 
genus Holnster. This determination had, however, been revised and the fossil 
referred to a new genus, Duncaniaster, whose affinities are with much later 
echinoids than Holaster. The fossil echinoids could all be included in one 
fauna; some of the most characteristic species, such as Clyioeaster gippskindiciis 
and Monosti/chia ati.^t rails, range from the Balcombian to the Kalimnan, and 
Lovenia forbcsi has the same variations in the Janjukian and Kalimnan. Some 
of the rarer species are limited to one locality, but that is probably only due 
to their scarcity. The characteristic Echinoids indicate one fauna, which is 
essentially Miocene, though it may have overlapped with the upper Oligocene 
and lower Pliocene. The evidence of the Echinoids is decidedly in favour of 
the view that there has been one great marine transgression along the southern 
coast of Australia, which reached its maximum in the Miocene if it were not 
confined to that system. 

The evidence of the Bryozoa is less definite, but when carefully examined it 
supports the same conclusions. Many of the genera lived in the Eocene and 
Cretaceous; but most wei,ght should be given to the most specialised Cheilosto- 
mata found in these deposits. Some well-known living species, such as 
Ifntepora hunnlana, Sriiit/in retiruUita, and Fordln sl-enei, are found in the 
Victorian beds, and they indicate an upper instead of a lower Kainozoic age. 
The survival of some older Bryozoa is less significant than the first appearance 
of the highly developed upjjer Kainozoic species. IMacgillivray in his monograph 
(1895) said that the Victorian Bryozoan fauna included no Eocene members, and 
that the different horizon.^ represented were not very different in age. With 
those conclusions I fully concur. 

The vertebrate evidence appears to me to support the same determination. 
The appearance of Sfjiialodon, Scaldicetits, and Zip/iius, and of such well-known 
species of sharks as Cnrrhnrodon megfilodoti and Oxyrhlna haslalis, which range 
from the lowest to the highest of the main Victorian marine series, is in favour 
of those beds being not earlier than Miocene. It is true that both species have 
been recorded from the Eocene of the TTnited States ; but these American 
Atlantic deposits are not an altogether satisfactory basis for correlation; and 
these species make their first appearance in the standard Kainozoic succession 
of Europe in the Miocene, and they last on to the Pliocene. 

The classification adopted recently by ]\Ir. Chapman seems to me in essential 
agreement with the evidence of the Echinoids, Bryozoa, and Vertebrates, most 
of the marine Kainozoic beds of southern Australia belonging to the Janjukian 
and being of Miocene age. 



6. The Evolution of Victoria durinq the Kainoz'oic Period. 
By T). J. Mahony, M.Sc, F.G.S. 

The Kainozoic period in Victoria is characterised by great earth movements 
accompanied by volcanic action ; the present topography is a consequent 
development. 

The central highland area (Palaeozoic rocks) extends from the eastern 
boundary of the State westwards to the Grampians ; to the north and south 



TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION C. 377 

it is bounded by low-lying plains (Kainozoic strata), which gradually broaden 
towards the west until they merge into one another. To the south Wilson's 
Promontory (granite), South Gippsland (Mesozoic), and the Cape Otway district 
(Mesozoic) rise above the plains. The highland area is essentially a dissected 
peneplain sinking from some 5,000 feet above sea level in Gippsland to 900 feet 
at its western extremity ; the only Kainozoic rocks upon it are river-gravels, 
lake-deposits, and volcanics. 

The plains (500 feet) are areas of Kainozoic sedimentation with some inter- 
bedded and overlying volcanic rocks ; the sedimentary series consists of 
lacustrine or estuarine beds, followed by marine clays (Oligocene), foraminiferal 
limestones (Miocene), and sandstones ^Pliocene). These beds rest upon 
Palaeozoic or Mesozoic rocks. 

On the surface of the ancient peneplain, 5,000 feet above sea level, ( ?) Miocene 
plant-remains and river-gravels are preserved beneath basalt at Dargo High 
Plains. This indicates a long pre-Miocene period of quiescence followed by a 
great uplift. This area has not been submerged during the Kainozoic. 

The nature of the Kainozoic series indicates that, outside the highland area, 
a gradual subsidence of considerable magnitude (Oligocene and Miocene), accom- 
panied by volcanic outbreaks (Miocene), was followed by re-elevation to a 
maximum of about 900 feet above sea level (Pliocene or post-Pliocene). There 
is evidence to show that the movements were not uniform in direction, though 
the net result was depression or elevation. Bass Strait is a recently sunken 
area in which equilibrium has not yet been established. 

The nearly horizontal position of the Kainozoic rocks indicates that the move- 
ments were vertical ; and there are, moreover, examples of Kainozoic faults in 
which the differential movement amounts to 900 feet. 

The volcanic rocks are basaltic except for sporadic occurrences of alkali 
locks in Eastern, Central, and Western Victoria. 

The Older Basalts are most abundant to the east of Melbourne. Some 
lemnants occur on the ancient peneplain 3,000 feet above the present streams, 
l)Ut the most extensive areas are at lower levels in South Gippsland. At Flinders 
the Older Basalt underlies marine Miocene, and has been proved by boring to 
be over 1,300 feet thick, and to extend from sea level to that depth. In some 
instances the age can be conclusively proved, but in otliers the evidence is poor. 
Tliese basalts are associated with the first great period of earth movements. 

The Newer Basalts are most extensively developed in the western district, 
wliere their northern boundary is not far from the 500 feet contour; here thev 
oveilie marine Kainozoics. Large areas are also found on the plateau west of 
Kilmore and along its northern ilanks. The Newer Ba.salts are never covered 
by marine deposits, except recent accumulations near the coast, their surface 
is little denuded, and many of the cones of loose scoria are almost perfect. 
It appears that the Newer Basalts mark the close of the last great movement 
whidi elevated the marine Kainozoics. 

In New South Wales and South Australia earth movements on a grand scale 
took place during the Kainozoic period, yet volcanic action was comparatively

By I-I. Hrkm^n, B.C.E., M.M.E., F.G.S. 

The brown coal-beds of Victoria are probably the thickest yet recorded in 
the world. The more extensive areas are the La Trobe Vallev, Alberton, 
Altona, and Lai Lai. Minor beds are widely distributed. 

The geological age has not yet been definitely fixed, except at Altona, where 
a brown coal-seam 140 feet thick underlies marine Oligocene beds. Flows of 
basalt overlie the brown coal in places, and underlie it in others. The range in 
age IS probably from Oligocene upwards. Seams outcrop at Narracan Thorp- 
dale, Dean's March, Morwell, and Boolarra. 

Where below the surface the seams are prospected by boring. In many bores 
coal of several hundred feet in thickness is shown ; one bore had an aggregate 
thickness of 781 feet of coal in a depth of 1,010 feet. The overburden is from 
a few feet to 500 feet deep. 



378 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C. 

In the Alberton area of about 300 square miles and tlie La Trobe Valley arta 
of 700 square miles there is probably 30,000,000,000 tons of coal. The approxi- 
mate area at Altona is 200 square miles, with a probable average thickness of 
50 feet of coal. At Lai Lai the coal covers three square miles with an avei-age 
thickness of 80 feet. 

The geological and geographical distribution of the various brown coal-seams 
is still being ascertained by boring ; the bores are being systematically tested for 
calorific value, gas production, and by-products. A typical analysis of the 
brown coal, as freshly mined, is : —

1. Oa the Terra Permo-Carboniferous and on tlte Correlation of that 
System. By W. S. Dun and Professor T. W. Edgewobtji David, 
C.M.G. 

The term Permo-Carboniferous was originally applied to certain formations 
111 Queensland whicli on stratigrapliical evidence were at the time conside-red 
to belong to one and the same general system. At the time it was considered 
that a series of strata at Gympie, which contained an assemblage of fossils 
ot distinct Permian afKnities, were stratigrapliically below another set of 
.strata kncvn as the Har Beds. Tiie latter contain among other fossils 
/nn,iis,a Li'pidodaidron austnilc, and Ancimi/r.'^, all typical Carboniferou.s 
tossil.s m Au.'^traha, and the first mostly of Devonian age. Accordingly these 
formations were grouped together under the term Pcrmo-.Carboniferous, and 
the name has subsequently been widely used. It has now been proved that, so 
tar as Queensland is concerned, the name has been given in error. The 
Gympie Beds are stratigraphically above the Star Beds, not below as was 
originally supposed. Nowhere in Austialia or Tasmania has a single trilobite 
or Lvjndodendron ever been found in our Carboniferous rocks proper. In the 
absence of a zoning of these Carboniferous rocks it is impossible to say what 
exactly are its equivalents in other parts of the world. If it is wholly Lower 
Carboniferous, as some suppose, there may be some justification for the retention 
o^f the term Permo-Carboniferous, but if its fauna and flora ascend to Upper 
Carboniferous, then it is suggested that there is much to be said in favour of 
using the terra Permian instead. In Russia Scliizodus occurs in rtumbers 
beneath the whole not only of the Glossopteris beds, but of the Gangavwpteris

beds also of the Dwina system. In South America the Lower Rocks of ihe 
Santa Catharina system appear to be more Permian than anything else, and 
the occurrence of the strong swimming reptile Mesosaurus both in the Permo- 
Carboniferous rocks of South America and of South Africa suggests that the 
South African Permo-Carboniferous rocks also may be chiefly Permian. 

In the correlation of the Australian Permo-Carboniferous formations, special 
emphasis is laid on the Indian facies of the West Australian Permo- 
Carboniferous fauna.

4. The Post-Jurassic Geography of Australia. Notes on the Hypothesis 
of Isostasy. By E. C. Andrews. 

The doctrine of isostasy implies the general correspondence, in weight, of all 
vertical columns of unit size composing the Earth's crust to a depth known as 
the depth of compensation. This depth is taken at 122 kilometres below sea 
level by Hayford.^ 

The excess of height of the unit columns, in continental areas, is con- 
sidered as being compensated by the excess of crustal density in suboceanic 
areas. Isostatic comjjensation is supposed to follow rapidly upon loading and 
unloading. Examples of such loading are sedimentation and the formation of 
a continental Ice Sheet, while examples of unloading are erosion and the 
disappearance of an Ice Sheet. The adjustment is considered to be a gradual, 
rather than a spasmodic, process. Anomalies of gravity, however, are recorded 
from many localities, and Gilbert - suggests that the explanation of such is 
to be sought in nucleal heterogeneity. 

Geograplnj. — East and West Australia form two positive, or buoyant, ele- 
ments, while the Inland Plains, in the main, represent a negative, or sunken, 
area. With these three elements should be considered New Zealand, Malaysia, 
the South Pacific, the Indian, and Southern Oceans. 

During Cretaceous time a great plain of erosion appears to have been 
formed in the positive elements of Australia, while the extensive epicon- 
tinental sea of that period was filled with the waste derived from the neighbour- 
ing erosion. Subsequently, both the old plain of erosion and the northern 
portion of the area of sedimentation were elevated to a moderate height and 
a long period of equilibrium and erosion ensued. This sequence of elevation 
and of pauses of equilibrium with erosion was repeated until the close of 
the Kosciusko Period, ^ the pauses between the uplifts becoming less impor- 
tant, but the amount of vertical movement becoming correspondingly emphasised. 

At various stages of the process basalts flooded Eastern Australia, especially 
in areas of older sedimentation. The appearance of the old basalt-covered 
stream-drifts is suggestive of a temporary subsidence for the plateau areas 
during the basaltic period. 

Strong streams, such as the Shoalhaven and the Hawkesbury, maintained their 
general courses against the uplifts along their lower portions. Hence it is 
inferred that the uplifts were effected slowly, nevertheless the periods of equi- 
librium separating the revivals of elevation were of much longer duration than 
the uplifts themselves.

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C. 381 

The researches of Dutton, Hayford, Bowie, Gilbert, and others appear to 
have placed the doctrine of isostatic compensation upon a firm basis ; neverthe- 
less, the operation of the adjustments does not appear, as yet, to be understood, 
and it is probable that cognisance has not been taken of all the factors. 

In the example cited, of the elevation of both the Great Mesozoic peneplain 
and a great portion of the loaded offshore area, it seems difficult, under the 
doctrine of continuous compensation, by erosion and sedimentation, to explain, 
in the first place, how the positive element could remain, for ages, in the one 
general position of equilibrium, while the offshore area was being loaded ; and, 
in the second place, how the elevatory movement could have received its initial 
impetus, especially as the effect appears greater than the cause if it be assumed 
that the Cretaceous sedimentation gave rise to the Tertiary uplifts. On the 
other hand, the foundering of suboceanic areas in the neighbourhood might be 
adduced as an explanation, but the evidence is not at all conclusive on this 
point. 

The liLstory of the revivals of elevation during Tertiary time over Eastern 
Australia indicates erustal adjustment by jump.s, and in this case also the 
increasing amount of vertical movement suggests that the elevations of the 
plateaus more than compensate for tlie erosion .sustained in these r&lt;&gt;gions during 
recent geological time. 

Tlie extrusion of the basalts is in harmony with the doctrine, but the 
action appears to liave been catastrophic, rather than gradual, in nature. 

The sequence of geographical forms cited suggests that sedimentation in- 
fluenced the formation of plateaus only in a minor degree, but, on the other 
hand, tliat stresses accumulated gradually within the zone of compensation, until 
a belt of weakness, or mobility, was established by means of which the ill- 
adjusted portions were connected. Upon the arrival of such a stage adjustment 
ensued with relative rapidity with the production of epeirogenic uplifts and 
depressions. This neither denies the ability of a load, sucJi as a mass of sedi- 
ments, or an Ice Cap, to depress tlie underlying region, nor doe.s it seek to 
exclude the tendency for an unloaded area to rise; it merely assigns to such 
agents a subordinate part in the shaping of the greater features of the Earth's 
crust. 

It is probable also that an analysis of a series of gravity measurements 
which may be taken hereafter in Australasia would reveal the e'xistence therein 
of gravity anomalies, and it is probable also that the disposition of these would 
be other than tho.se which might have been inferred from a mere inspection 
of the topography.

There are two main coal-fields in Pennsylvania, the Bituminous and the 
Anthracite. The latter field comprises an area of approximately 480 square miles 
situated in the highly folded portion of the Appalachian Province, while the 



382 TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION C. 

I'ormer field covers a much larger area with but gently folded strata. Between 
these two fields are limited areas underlain by serai-anthracite coal in strata 
whidi have suffered a medium amount of diastrophism. 

So close is the relationship between intense diastrophism and the development 
of anthracite coal, that the influence of pressure— combined with conditions 
favourable for the escape of the volatile constituents from the vegetable matter 

^seems to be self-evident, although other theories, such as the action of bacteria, 

&amp;c., have been advanced to account for the origin of anthracite. Ti\e structure 
of some of the anthracite basins is extremely complex, and the coal can often be 
mined only by special methods, especially where the Mammoth seam reaches 
60 feet in thickness. . 

In the Bituminous field, 'rolls ' and ' horsebacks' are common, and investiga- 
tion has shown that these are, nsually. nearly parallel to the larger moimtain 
.structures.

FEIDAY, AUGUST U. 
The President delivered the following Address : — 

Progressive Evolution and the Origin of Species. 

The opening years of the present century have witnessed a remarkable develop- 
ment of Biology as an experimental science, a development which, however lull 
of promise it may be for the future, for the time being appears to have resulted 
in a widespread disturbance of ideas which have themselves only recently 
succeeded in gaining general acceptance. The theory of organic evolution, 
plainly enough enunciated at the close of the eighteenth and the beginning of 
the nineteenth century by Buffon, Lamarck, and Erasmus Darwin, remained 
unconvincing to the great majority of thinking men until the genius of Charles 
Darwin not only brought together and presented the evidence in such a manner 
that it could no longer be ignored, but elaborated a logical explanation of the 
way in which organic evolution might be supposed to have taken place. 
Thauks to his laboui-s and those of Alfred Russel Wallace, supported by the 
powerful influence of such men as Huxley and Hooker, the theory was placed 
upon a firm foundation, in a position which can never again be assailed with 
any prospect of success. 

This statement is, I believe, entirely justified with regard to the theory 
of organic evolution itself, but the case is very different when we come to 
investigate the position of the various subsidiary theories which have been put 
forward from time to time with regard to wliat may perhaps be termed the 
modus operandi, the means by which organic evolution has been effected. It 
is in this field that controversy rages more keenly than ever before. Lamarck 
told us that evolution was due to the accumulated results of individual effort in 
response to a changing environment, and also to the direct action of the environ- 
ment upon the organism. Darwin and Wallace taught us that species 
originated by the natural selection of favourable variations, and under the 
influence of Weismann's doctrine of the non-inheritance of acquired characters 
the theory of uatural selection is in danger of becoming crystallised into an 
inflexible dogma. In recent years De Vries has told us that species arise by 
sudden mutations, and not by slow successive changes, while one of the most 
extreme exponents of ' Mendelisra,' Professor Lotsy, lately informed us that all 
species arise by crossing, and seriously suggested that the vertebrate type arose 
by the crossing of two invertebrates ! 

This curious and many-sided divergence of opinion amongst expert biologists 
is undoubtedly largely due to the introduction of experimental methods into 
biological science. Such methods have proved very fruitful in results which 
at first sight seem to be mutually contradictory, and each group of workers has 
built up its own theorv mainlv on the basis of observations in its own restricted 
field. 



384 TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION D. 

Professor Bateson has said in his recently pubHshed ' Problems of Genetics ' : 
' When ... we contemplate the problem of Evolution at large the hope at the 
present time of constructing even a mental picture of that process grovifs weak 
almost to the point of vanishing. We are left wondering that so lately men in 
general, whether scientific or lay, were so easily satisfied. Our satisfaction, as 
we now see, was chiefly founded on ignorance.' ^ 

In view of this striking pronouncement on the part of one who has devoted 
his life with signal success to the experimental investigation of evolutionary 
problems, the remarks which I propose to lay before you for your consideration 
to-day may well appear rash and ill-advised. I cannot believe, however, that the 
position is re-ally quite so black as it is painted. We must perforce admit that 
the divers theories with regard to the working of organic evolution cannot all 
be correct in all their details, but it may be that each contains its own elements 
of truth, and that if these elements can but be recognised and sorted out, they 
may perhaps be recombined in such a form as to afford at any rate a plausible 
working hypothesis. We must bear in mind from the outset that in dealing with 
such a complex problem many factors have to be taken into account, and that 
widely different views on the question may be merely one-sided and not neces- 
sarily mutually exclusive. 

I take it there are three principal facts, or groups of facts, that have to be 
accounted for by any theory of organic evolution : — 

(1) The fact that, on the whole, evolution has taken place in a progressive 
manner along definite and divergent lines. 

(2) The fact that individual animals and plants are more or less precisely 
adapted in their organisation and in their behaviour to the conditions under 
which they have to live. 

(3) The fact that evolution has resulted in the existence on the earth to day 
of a vast number of more or less well-defined groups of animals and plants which 
we call species. 

The first of these facts appears to me to be the most fundamental, and at the 
same time the one to which least attention is usually paid. The great question, 
after all, is, Why do organisms progress at all instead of remaining stationary 
from generation to generation ? To answer this question it is not necessary to go 
back to the beginning and consider the case of the first terrestrial organisms, 
whatever they may have been, nor are we obliged to take as illustrations the 
lowest organisms known to us as existing at the present day. We may consider 
the problem at any stage of evolution, for at each stage progress is, or may be, 
still taking place. We may even begin by considering what is usually regarded 
as the highest stage of all, man himself ; and indeed this seems the most natural 
thing to do, for we certainly know more about the conditions of progress in man 
than in any other organism. I refer, of course, at the moment, not to progress 
in bodily organisation, but to progress in the ordinary sense of the word, the 
progress, say, of a family which rises in the course of a few generations from 
a position of obscure poverty to one of wealth and influence. You may perhaps 
say that such a case has no bearing upon the problem of organic evolution in a 
state of nature, and that we ought to confine our attention to the evolution of 
bodily structure and function. If so, I must reply that you have no right to 
limit the meaning of the term evolution in this manner; the contrast between 
man and nature is purely arbitrary; man is himself a living organism, and 
all the improvements that he effects in his own condition are part of the progress 
of evolution in his particular case. At any rate I must ask you to accept this 
case as our first illustration of a principle that may be applied to organisms 
in general. 

If we inquire into the cause of the progress of our human family I think there 
can be only one answer — it is due to the accumulation of capital, or, as I should 
prefer to put it, to the accumulation of potential energy, either in the form of 
material wealth or of education. What one generation saves is available for the 
next, and thus each succeeding generation gets a better start in life, and is able 
to rise a little higher than the preceding one. 

Every biologist knows, of course, that there are many analogous oases amongst 

' Problems off Genetics, p. 97. 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 385 

the lower animals, and also amongst plants. The accumulation of food-yolk in 
the egg has undoubtedly been one of the chief factors in the progressive evolu- 
tion of animals, although it has been replaced in the highest forms by a 
more effective method of supplying potential energy to the developing offspring. 
It may indeed be laid down as a general law that each generation, whether of 
animals or of plants, accumulates more energy than it requires for its own main- 
tenance, and uses the surplus to give the next generation a start in life. There 
is every reason to believe that this has been a progressive process throughout 
the whole course of evolution, for the higher the degree of organisation the more 
perfect do we find the arrangements for securing the welfare of the offspring. 

We cannot, of course, trace this process bark to its commencement, because 
we know nothing of the nature of the earliest living things, but we may pause 
for a moment to inquire whether any phenomena occur amongst simple 
unicellular organisms that throw any light upon the subject. What we want to 
know is — How did the habit of accumulating surplus energy and handing it on 
to the next generation first arise? 

Students of Professor H. S. Jennings' admirable work on the ' Behaviour of 
the Lower Organisms ' will remember that his experiments have led him to the 
conclusion that certain Protozoa, such as Stentor, are able to learn by experience 
how to make prompt and effective responses to certain stimuli; that after they 
have been stimulated in the same way a number of times they make the appro- 
priate response at once without having to go through the whole process of trial 
and error by which it was first attained. In other words, they are able by 
practice to perform a given action with less expenditure of energy. Some 
modification of the protoplasm must take place which renders the performance 
of an act the easier the oftener it has been repeated. The same is of course 
true in the case of the higher animals, and we express the fact most simply by 
saying that the animal establishes habits. From the mechanistic point of view 
we might say that the use of the machine renders it more perfect and better 
adapted for its purpose. In the present state of our knowledge I think we 
cannot go beyond this, but must content ourselves with recognising the power of 
profiting by experience as a fundamental property of living protoplasm. 

It appears to me that this power of profiting by experience lies at the root of our 
problem, and that in it we find a chief cause of progressive evolution. Jennings 
speaks of the principle involved here as the ' Law of the readier resolution of 
physiological states after repetition,' and, similarly, I think we must recognise 
a ' Law of the accumulation of surplus energy ' as resulting therefrom. Let us 
look at the case of the accumulation of food-yolk by the egg-cell a little more 
closely from this point of view. Every cell takes in a certain amount of potential 
energy in the form of food for it's own use. If it leads an active life, either as 
an independent organism or as a constituent part of an organism, it may expend 
by far the greater part, possibly even the whole, of that energy upon its own 
requirements, but usually something is left over to be handed down to its imme- 
diate descendants. If, on the other hand, the cell exhibits very little activity 
and expends very little energy, while placed in an environment in which food 
is abundant, it will tend to accumulate surplus energy in excess of its own needs. 
Such is the case with the egg-cells of the multicellular animals and plants. 
Moreover, the oftener the process of absorbing food-material is repeated the 
easier does it become ; in fact, the egg-cell establishes a habit of storing up 
reserve material or food-yolk. Inasmuch as it is a blastogenic character, there 
can be no objection to supposing that this habit will be inherited by future 
generations of egg-cells. Indeed we are obliged to assume that this will be the 
case, for we know that the protoplasm of each succeeding generation of egg-cells 
is directly continuous with that of the preceding generation. We thus get at 
any rate a possibility of the progressive accumulation of potential energy in the 
germ-cells of successive generations of multicellular organisms, and of course 
the same arsjument holds good with regard to successive generations of Protista.. 

It would seem that progressive evolution must follow as a necessary result 
of the law of the accumulation of surplus energy in all cases where there is nothing 
to counteract that law, for each generation gets a better start than its prede- 
cessor, and is able to carry on a little further its struggle for existence with the 
environment. It may be said that this argument proves too much, that if it 

1914. c 



380 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. 

were correct all organisms would by this time have attained to a high degree of 
organisation, and that at any rat« we should not expect to find such simple 
organisms as bacteria and amoebae still surviving. This objection, which, of 
course, applies equally to other theories of organic evolution, falls to the 
ground when we consider that there must be many factors of which we know 
nothing which may prevent the establishment of progressive habits and render 
impossible the accumulation of surplus energy. Many of the lower organisms, 
like many human beings, appear to have an inherent incapacity for progress, 
though it may be quite impossible for us to say to what that incapacity is due. 

It will be observed that in the foregoing remarks I have concentrated atten- 
tion upon the storing up of reserve material by the egg-cells, and in so doing 
have avoided the troublesome qiiestion of the inheritance of so-called acquired 
characters. I do not wish it to be supposed, however, that I regard this as 
the only direction in which the law of the accumulation of surplus energy can 
manifest itself, for I believe that the accumulation of surplus energy by the 
body may be quite as important as a factor in progressive evolution as the corre- 
sponding process in the germ-cells themselves. The parents, in the case of the 
higher animals, may supply surplus energy, in the form of nutriment or other- 
wise, to the offspring at all stages of its development, and the more capital the 
young animal receives the better will be its chances in life, and the better those 
of ibs own offspring. 

In all these processes, no doubt, natural selection plays an important part, 
but, in dealing with the accumulation of food material by the egg-cells, one of 
my objects has been to show that progressive evolution would take place even if 
there were no such thing as natural selection, that the slow successive variations 
in this case are not chance variations, but due to a fundamental property of 
living protoplasm and necessarily cumulative. 

Moreover, the accumulation of surplus energy in the form of food-yolk is 
only one of many habits which the protoplasm of the germ-cells may acquire in 
a cumulative manner. It may learn by practice to respond with increased 
promptitude and precision to other stimuli besides that of the presence of 
nutrient material in its environment. It may learn to secrete a protective mem- 
brane, to respond in a particular manner to the presence of a germ-cell of the 
opposite sex, and to divide in a particular manner after fertilisation has taken 
place. 

Having thus endeavoured to account for the fact that progressive evolution 
actually occurs by attributing it primarily to the power possessed by living 
]notop]asm of learning by experience and thus establishing habits by which it 
is able to respond more quickly to environmental stimuli, we have next to 
inquire what it is that determines the definite lines along which progress 
manifests itself. 

Let us select one of these lines and investigate it as fully as the time at our 
disposal will permit, with a view to seeing whether it is possible to formulate a 
reasonable hypothesis as to how evolution may have taken place. Let us take 
the line which we believe has led up to the evolution of air-breathing verte- 
brates. The only direct evidence at our disposal in such a case is, of course, the 
evidence of palieontology, but^ I am going to ask you to allow me to set this 
evidence, which, as you know, is of an extremely fragmentary character, aside, 
and base my remarks upon the ontogenetic evidence, which, although indirect, 
will, I think, be found sufficient for our purpose. One reason for concentrating 
our attention upon this aspect of the problem is that I wish to show that the 
recapitulation of phylogenetic history in individual development is a logical 
necessity if evolution has really taken place. 

We may legitimately take the nucleated Protozoon cell as our starting-point, 
for, whatever may have been the course of evolution that led up to the cell, 
there can be no question that all the higher organisms actually start life in this 
condition. 

We suppose, then, that our ancestral Protozoon acquired the habit of taking 
in food material in excess of its own requirements, and of dividing into two 
parts whenever it reached a certain maximum size. Here again we must, for 
the sake of simplicity, ignore the facts that even a Protozoon is by no means a 
simple organism, and that its division, usually at any rate, is a very complicated 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 337 

process. Each of the daiigliter-cells presently separates from its aistor-coll 
aiui goes its own way as a complete individual, still a Frotozoon. It seems not 
improbalile that the separation may he due to the renewed stimulus oC hunger 
impelling each cell to wander actively in search of food. In some cases, how- 
ever, the daughter-cells remain together and form a colony, and probably this 
iKibit has been rendered possible by a sufficient accumulation of surplus energy 
in the form of food-yolk on the part of the parent rendering it unnecessary for 
the daughter-cells to separate in search of food at such an early date. One of 
the forms of colony met with amongst existing Protozoa is the hollow sphere, 
as we see it, for example, in Sphrerozoum and Volvox, and it is highly probable' 
that the assumption of this form is due largely, if not entirely, to what are 
commonly called mechanical causes, though we are not in a position to say 
exactly what these causes may be. The widespread occurrence of the blasto- 
sphere or blastula stage in ontogeny is a sufficiently clear indication that the 
hollow, spherical Protozoon colony formed a' stage in "the evolution of the hi"her 
animals. ° 

By the time our ancestral organism has reached this stage, and possibly even 
before, a new complication has arisen. The cells of which the colony is com- 
posed no longer remain all alike, but become differentiated, primarily into two 
groups, which we distinguish as somatic cells and germ-cells respectively. 

From this point onwards evolution ceases to ibe a really continuous process, 
but is broken up into a series of ontogenies, at the close of each of which the 
organism has to go back and make a fresh start in the unicellular condition, for 
the somatic cells sooner or later become exhausted in their conflict with the 
environment and perish, leaving the germ-cells behind to take up the running. 
That the germ-cells do not share the fate of the somatic cells must be attributed 
to the fact that they take no part in the struggle for existence to which the body 
13 exposed. They simply multiply and absorb nutriment under the protection 
of the body, and therefore retain their potential energy unimpaired. They are 
in actual fact, as is .so often said, equivalent to so many Protozoa, and, like 
the Protozoa, are endowed with a potential immortality. 

We know that, if placed under suitable conditions, or, in other words, if 
exposed to the proper environmental stimuli these germ-cells will give rise to 
new organisms, like that in the body of which they were formerly enclosed. 
One of the necessary conditions is, with rare exceptions, the union of the germ- 
cells in pairs to form zygotes or fertilised ova; but I propose, in the first 
instance, for the sake of simplicity, to leave out of account the existence of the 
sexual process and the results that follow therefrom, postponing the considera- 
tion of these to a later stage of our inquiry. I wish, moreover, to make it quite 
dear that organic evolution must have taken place if no such event as amphimixis 
had ever occurred. 

What, then, may the germ-cells be expected to do ? How are they going to 
begin their development? In endeavouring to answer this question we must 
remember that the behaviour of an organism at any moment depends upon two 
sets of factors— the nature of its own constitution on the one hand, and the 
nature of its environment on the other. If these factors are ideiitic&lt;al for 
any two individual organisms, then the behaviour of these two individuals must 
be the same. If the germ-cells of any generation are identical w'th those of the 
preceding generation, and if they develop under identical conditions, then the 
soma of the one generation must also be identical with that of the other. - 
Inasmuch as they are parts of the same continuous germ-plasm— leaving out 
of account the complications introduced by amphimixis — we may assume that 
the germ-cells of the two generations are indeed identical in nearly every 
respect ; but there will be a slight difference, due to the fact that those of the 
later generation will have inherited a rather larger supply of initial energy and a 
slightly greater facility for responding to stimuli of various kinds, for the 
gradual accumulation of these properties will have gone a stage further. The 
environment also wiU be very nearly identical in the two cases, for we know 
from experiment that if it were not the organism could not develop at all.

Throughout the whole course of its ontogeny the organism must repeat with 
approximate accuracy the stages passed through hy its ancestors, because at 
every stage there will be an almost identical organism exposed to almost identical 
stimuli. We may, however, expect an acceleration of development and a slight 
additional progress at the end of ontogeny as the result of the operation of the law 
of the accumulation of surplus energy and of the slightly increased facility in re- 
sponding to stimuli. The additional progress, of course, will probably be so 
slight that from one generation to the next we should be quite unable to detect 
it, and doubtless there will be frequent backslidings due to various causes. 

We can thus formulate a perfectly reasonable explanation of how it is that 
the egg first undergoes segmentation and then gives rise to a blastula resembling 
a hollow protozoon colony; it does so simply because at every stage it must do 
what its ancestors did under like conditions. We can also see that progressive 
evolution must follow from the gradual accumulation of additions at the end of 
each ontoigeny, these additions being rendered possible by the better start which' 
each individual gets at the commencement of its career. 

Let us now glance for a moment at the next stage in phylogeny, the con- 
version of the hollow spherical protozoon colony into the ccslenterate type of 
organisation, represented in ontogeny by the process of gastrulation. Here 
again it is probable that this process is explicable to a large extent upon 
mechanical principles. According to Rhumbler,^ the migration of endoderm 
cells into the interior of the blastula is partly due to chemotaxis and partly to 
changes of surface tension, which decreases on the inner side of the vegetative 
cells owing to chemical changes set up in the blastocoel fluid. 

We may, at this point, profitably ask the question, Is the endoderm thus 
formed an inherited feature of the organism ? The material of which it is 
composed is of course derived from the egg-cell continuously by repeated cell- 
division, but the way in which that material is used by the organism depends 
upon the environment, and we know from experiment that modifications of the 
environment actually do produce corresponding modifications in the an-angement 
of the material. We know, for example, that the addition of salts of lithium 
to the water in which certain embryos are developing causes the endoderm to be 
protruded instead of invaginated, so that we get a kind of inside-out gastrula, 
the well-known lithium larva. 

It appears, then, that an organism re -My inherits from its parents two things : 
(1) a certain amount of protoplasm locded with potential energy, with which to 
begin operations, and (2) an appropriate environment. Obviou.sly the one is useless 
without the other. An egg cannot develop unless it is provided with the proper 
environment at every stage. Therefore, when we say that an organism inherits a 
particular character from its parents, all we mean is that it inherits the power 
to i^roduce that character under the influence of certain environmental stimuli.'' 
The inheritance of the environment is of at least as much importance as the 
inheritance of the material of which the organism is composed. The latter 
indeed is only inherited to a very small extent, for the amount of material in 
the egg-cell may be almo.st infinitesimal in comparison with the amount present 
in the adult, nearly the whole of which is captured from the environment and 
assimilated during ontogeny. 

From this point of view the distinction between somatogenic and blastogenic 
characters really disappears, for all the characters of the adult organism are 
acquired afresh in each generation as a result of re.=&gt;ponse to environmental 
stimuli during development. This is clearly indicated bj' the fact that you 
cannot change the stimuli without changing the result. 

Time forbids tis to discuss the phylogenetic stages through which the coelen- 
terate passed into the coelomate type, the ccelomate into the chordate, and the 
chordate into the primitive vertebrate. We must admit that as yet we know 
nothing of the particular causes that determined the actual course of evolution 
at each successive stage. What we do know, however, about tihe influence of 
the environment, both upon the developing embryo and upon the adult, is sufR-

eient to justify us in believing that every successive modification must have been 
due to a response on the part of the organism to some environmental change. 
Even if the external conditions remained practically identical throughout long 
periods of time, we must remember that the internal conditions would be 
different in each generation, because each generation starts with a slightly 
increased capital and carries on its development a little further under internal 
conditions modified accordingly. . ,■ 

At this point it may be asked, Is the response to environmental stimuli a purely 
mechanical one, and, if so, how can we account for the fact that at every stage 
in its evolution the organism is adapted to its environment ? We shall have to 
return to this question later on, but it may be useful to point out once more 
that there is good reason to believe — especially from the experimental w'ork of 
Jennings — that the response of even a unicellular organism to stimuli is to a 
large extent purposive; that the organism learns by experience, by a kiiid of 
process of trial and error, how to make the response most favourable to itself 
under any given change of conditions ; in other words, that the organism selects 
those modes of response that are most conducive to its own well-being. Under the 
term response to stimuli we must of course include those responses of the living 
protoplasm which result in modifications of bodily structure, and hence the 
evolution of bodily structure will, on the whole, be of an adaptive character 
and will follow definite lines. There is good reason for believing, however, that 
many minor modifications in structure may arise and persist, incidentally as it 
were, that have no significance as adaptations. 

One of the most remarkable and distinctive features of the lower vertebrates 
is the presence of gill-slits as accessory organs of respiration. These gill-slits 
are clearly an adaptation to aquatic life. When the ancestors of the higher 
vertebrates left the water and took to life on laud the gills disappeared and 
were replaced by lungs, adapted for air-breathing. The change must, of course, 
have been an extremely gradual one, and we get a very clear indication of how 
it took place in the surviving dipnoids, which have remained in this respect in 
an intermediate condition between the fishes and the amphibia, possessing and 
using both gills and lungs. 

We also know that even the most highly specialised air-breathing vertebrates, 
whioh never live in water and never require gills or gill-slits at all, nevertheless 
possess very distinct gill-slits diu-ing a certain period of their development. This 
is one of the most familiar illustrations of the law of recapitulation, and my 
only excuse for bringing it forward now is that I wish, before going further, to 
consider a difficulty — perhaps more apparent than real — that arises in comiection 
with such cases. 

It might be argued that if gill-slits arose in response to the stimuli of aquatic 
life, and if these stimuli are no longer operative in the case of air-breathing 
vertebrates, then gill-slits ought not to be developed at any stage of their 
existence. This argument is, I think, fully met by the following considerations. 

At any given moment of ontogenetic development the condition of any organ 
is merely the last term of a series of morphogenetic stages, while its environ- 
ment at the same moment — which of course includes its relation to all the other 
organs of the body — is likewise merely the last term of a series of environmental 
stages. We have thus two parallel series of events to take into consideration in 
endeavouring to account for the condition of any part of an organism — or of the 
organism as a whole— at any period of its existence : — 

El K, E,j ...... E« environmental stages. 

Ml M2 Ma ..... . Mil morphogenetic stages. 

Ontogeny is absolutely conditioned by the proper correlation of the stages of 
these two series at every point, and hence it is that any sudden change of 
environment is usually attended by disastrous consequences. Thus, after the 
fish-like ancestors of air-breathing vertebrates had left the water and become 
amphibians, they doubtless still had to go back to the water to lay their eggs, 
in order that the eggs might have the proper conditions for their development. 

Obviously the environment can only be altered with extreme slowness, and 
one of the first duties of the parent is to provide for the developing offspring 
conditions as nearly as possible identical with those under which its own develop- 



390 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. 

ment took place. It is, however, inevitable that, as phylogenetic evolution pro- 
gresses, the conditions under which the young organism develops should change. 
In the first place, the mere tendency to acceleration of development, to which 
we have already referred, must tend to dislocate the correlation between the 
ontogenetic series and the environmental series. Something of this kind seems 
to have taken place in the life-cycle of many Hydrozoa, resulting in the sup-' 
pression of the free medusoid generation and the gradual degeneration of the 
gonophore. But it i.s probably in most cases change in the environment of the 
adult that is responsible for such dislocation. 

To return to the case of tlie amphibians. At the present day some amphi- 
bians, such as the newts and frogs, still lay their eggs in water, while the 
closely related salamanders retain them in the oviducts until they have developed 
into highly organised aquatic larvre, or even into what is practically the adult 
condition. Kammerer has shown that the period at wliich the young are born 
can be varied by changing the environment of the parent. In the absence of 
water the normally aquatic larvae of the spotted salamander may be retained in 
tiie oviduct until they have lost their gills, and they are then born in the fully- 
developed condition, while, conversely, the alpine salamander, whose young are 
normally born in the fully-developed state, without gills, may be made to deposit 
them prematurely in water in the larval, gill-bearing condition. 

There can be no doubt that the ancestral amphibians laid their eggs in water 
in a completely undeveloped condition. The habit of retaining them in the body 
during their development must have arisen very gradually in the phylogenetic 
history of the salamanders, the period for which the young were retained 
growing gradually longer and longer. It is obvious that "this change of habit 
involves a corresponding change in the environmental conditions under which 
the yomig develop, and in cases in which the young are not born until they 
have reached practically the adult condition 'this change directly affects 
practically the whole ontogeny. We may say that the series 

El Ea E3 . . . . . . . En has become 

El' E,' E3' En', 

and as the change of environment must produce its effect upon the developing 
organism the series 

Ml M2 M3 M« will have become 

Ml' M2' M3' M"'. 

We must remember tliat throughout the whole course of jihylogenetic evolu- 
tion this series is constantly lengthening, so that what was the adult condition 
at one time becomes an embryonic stage in future generations, and that tlie 
series thus represents not only the ontogeny, but also, though in a more or less 
imperfect manner, the phylogeny of the organism. 

The character of each stage in ontogeny must depend upon (1) the morpho- 
logical and physiological constitution of the preceding stage, and (2) the nature 
of the environment in which development is taking place. We cannot, however, 
distinguish sharply between tliose two sets of factors, for, in a certain sense, 
the enviroiunent gradually becomes incorporated in the organism itself as 
development proceeds, each part contributing to the environment of all the 
remainder, and the influence of this internal portion of the environment ever 
becoming more and more important. 

The whole process of evolution depends upon changes of environment taking 
place so gradually that the necessary self-adjustment of the organism at every 
stage is possible. In the case of our amphibia the eggs could probably undergo 
the first stages of development, the preliminary segmentation, within the oviduct 
of the parent just as well as in the water, for in both cases they would be 
enclosed in their envelopes, and the morphological differences between the early 
stages in the two cases might be expected to be quite insignificant. But it 
must be the same at each term of the scries, for each term is built upon the 
foundation of the preceding one, and the whole process takes place by slow and 
imperceptible degrees. 

It is true that by the time we reach the fonnation of the vestigial gill-slits 
in the embryo of one of the higher vertebrates tlic cuviroiuneutal conditions are 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 391 

very different from those under which gill-slits were developed in their aquatic 
ancestors. But what then? Are not tlie gill-slits also very different? The 
changed environment has had its effect. The gills themselves are never 
developed, and the gill-slits never become functional; moreover, they disappear 
completely at later stages of development, when the conditions of life become 
still more different and their presence would be actually detrimental to their 
possessor. The embryo with the vestigial gill-slits is, as a whole, perfectly well 
adapted to its enviroimient, though the gill-slits themselves have ceased to be 
adaptive characters. They still appear because the environmental conditions, 
and especially the internal conditions, which have now become far more 
important than the external ones, are still such as to cause them to do so. 

I think the chief difficulty in forming a mental picture of the manner in 
which evolution has taken place, and especially in accounting for the phenomenon 
of recapitulation in ontogeny, which is merely another aspect of the same 
problem, arises from attempting to take in too much at once. There is no 
difficulty in understanding how any particular stage is related to the correspond- 
ing stage in the previous generation, and the whole series of stages, whether 
looked at from the ontogenetic or from the phylogenetic point of, view, can be 
nothing else but the sum of its successive terms. 

It will be convenient, before going further, to sum up the results at which 
we have so far arrived from the point of view of the theory of heredity. We 
have as yet seen no reason to distinguish between somatogenic and blastogenic 
characters. All the characters of the adult animal are acquired during onto- 
geny as the result of the reaction of the organism to environmental stimuli, 
both internal and external. All that the organism actually inherits is a certain 
amount of protoplasm — endowed with a certain amount of energy — and a certain 
sequence of environmental conditions. In so far as these are identical in any 
two successive generations the final result must be identical also, the child must 
resemble the parent; in so far as they are different the child will differ from 
the parent, but the differences in environment cannot be very great without 
preventing development altogether. 

So far, it is clear, there has been no need to think of the germ-cells as 
the bearers of material factors or determinants that are responsible for the 
appearance of particular characters in the adult organism ; nor yet to suppose 
that they are, to use the phraseology of the mnemic theory of heredity, charged 
with the memories of past generations. They have been regarded as simple 
protoplasmic units, and tlie entire ontogeny has appeared as the necessary result 
of the reaction between the organism and its environment at each successive 
stage of development. This cannot, however, be a complete explanation of 
ontogeny, for if it were we should expect all eggs, when allowed to develop 
under the same conditions from start to finish, to give rise to the same adult 
form, and this we know is not the case. We know also, from observation and 
experiment, that the egg is in reality by no means a simple thing but an 
extremely complex one, and that different parts of the egg may be definitely 
correlated with corresponding parts of the adult body. It has been demon- 
strated in certain cases that the egg contains special organ- forming substances 
definitely located in .the cytoplasm, and that if these are removed definite parts 
of the organism into which the egg develops will be missing. We know, also, 
that the nucleus of the germ-cell of either sex contains— at any rate at certain 
periods — a number of perfectly well-defined bodies, the chromosomes, and these 
also have been definitely correlated in certain cases with special features of the 
adult organisation. 

Before we can hope to complete our mental picture of the manner in which 
organic evolution has taken place, if only in outline, it is evident that we must 
be able to account for the great complexity of structure which the germ-cells 
themselves have managed to acquire, and also to form some idea of the effect of 
tiiis complication upon the development of both the individual and the race. 

We must consider the origin of cytoplasmic and nuclear complications of the 
egg separately, for they appear to be due fundamentally to two totally distinct 
sets of factors. In the first place we have to remember that during oogenesis 
tiie egg-cell grows to a relatively large size by absorbing nutrient material from 
tiic body in which it is enclosed. It is this nutrient material that is used for 



392 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D, 

building up the deutoplasm or food-yolk. There is good reasou for believing that 
the character of this nutrient material will change, during the course of evolu- 
tion, pari 2MSSU with the changing character of the organism by which it is 
supplied. Doubtless the change is of a chemical nature, for we know from pre- 
cipitin experiments that the body fluids of closely allied species, or even of the 
two sexes of the same species, do exhibit distinctly recognisable difierences in 
chemical composition. It also appears highly probable, if not certain, from such 
experiments as those of Agar upon Simocephalus, that substances taken in with 
the food and which bring about conspicuous modifications of bodily structure, 
may at the same time be absorbed and .stored up by the egg-cells so as to bring 
about corresponding changes in the adults into which the eggs develop. 

There seems therefore to be no great difficulty in comprehending, at any rate 
in a general way, how the egg may become the repository of definite chemical 
substances, organ-forming substances if we like to call them so, possibly to be 
classed with the hormones and enzymes, which will influence the development in 
a particular manner as soon as the appropriate conditions arise. 

Unfortunately, time will not allow of our following up this line of thought 
on the i^resent occasion, but we may notice, before passing on, that with the 
accumulation 'of organ-forming substances in the egg we have introduced the 
possibility of changes in bodily structure, to whatever cause they may be due, 
being represented by correlated modifications in the germ-cells, and this is doubt- 
less one of the reasons why the germ-cells of different animals are not all alike 
with regard to their potentialities of development.^ 

We now come to the question of how the nucleus of the germ-cell acquired its 
great complexity of structure. We are not concerned here with the origin of the 
difierentiation into nucleus and cytoplasm and the respective parte played by the 
two in the life of the cell. The problem which we have to consider is the com- 
plication introduced by the sexual process, by the periodically recurring union 
of the germ-cells in pairs, or, as Weismann has termed it, amphimixis. This is 
\^ell known to be essentially a nuclear phenomenon, in which the so-called 
chromatin substance is especially concerned, and it is a phenomenon which must 
have made its appearance at a very early stage of evolution, for it is exliibitcd 
in essentially the same mamier alike in the higher plants and animals and in 
unicellular organisms. 

Let us suppose, for the sake of argument, that when amphimixis first took 
place the chromatin of each germ-cell was homogeneous, but that it differed 
slightly in different germ-cells of the same species as a result of exposure to 
slightly different conditions during its past history. What would be likely to 
happen when two different samples of chromatin came together in the zygote ? 
The result would surely depend upon the interaction of the complex colloidal 
multimolecules of which the chromatin is composed. Various possibilities would 
arise. (1) The two samples might differ in such a way as to act as poisons to one 
another, disturbing each other's molecular equilibrium to such an extent that 
neither could survive. This is possibly what happens when an ovum is fertilised 
by a spermatozoon of a distinct species, though there are, of course, exceptions. 
(2) They might be so alike as to be able to amalgamate more or less completely, 
so that there would simply be an increase of chromatin of possibly more or less 
modified constitution. (3) They might continue to exist side by side, each 
maintaining its own individual character. 

In the third case the union of the two different samples would give rise to a 
mass of chromatin of twofold nature, and repetition of the process from genera- 
tion to generation would, as Weismann has shown, result in ever-increasing 
heterogeneity, luitil the cliromatin came to consist of a great number of different 
concrete particles, each of which might conceivably differ from all the others. 
But when two heterogeneous masses of chromatin meet in the zygote there may 
be all sorts of mutual attractions and repulsions between the different coUoidal 
multimolecules, for all three of our supposed cases may arise simultaneously, 
and thus the results may become extremely complicated. 

The chromatin of the germ-cells in all existing organisms is undoubtedly 
heterogeneous, and this heterogeneity may be to some extent visibly expressed 

* Compare Cunningham's 'Hormone Theory' of Heredity {Archiv fiir 
EntwkMunfjsmrrlianih dcr Organi-^mcn. Bd. xxvi. Heft 3). 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 393 

in its aiiaiiigemeut in more or less multiform chromosomes diuiug mitosis. We 
may provisionally accept Weismann's view that these cliromosomes are them- 
selves heterogeneous, being composed of chromomeres or ids, wliich in their 
turn are composed of determinants. 

All this complexity of structure may be attributed to the effects of oft- 
repeated amphimixis, a view which is supported in the most striking manner by 
the fact that the nucleus in all ordinary somatic cells (in animals and in the 
diploid generation of plants) has a double set of chromosomes, one derived from 
the male and the other from tlie female parent, and by the well-known 
phenomenon of chromatin reduction which always precedes amphimixis. 

When we approach the problem of heredity from the experimental side we 
get very strong evidence of the existence in the germ-plasm of definite material 
substances associated with the inheritance of special characters. Mendelian 
workers generally sjaeak of these substances as factors, but the conception of 
factors is evidently closely akin to that of Weismann's hypothetical determinants. 
The cytological evidence fits in very well with the view that the factors in ques- 
tion may be definite material particles, and it is quite possible that such particles 
may have a specific chemical constitution to which their effects upon the 
developing organism are due. 

From our point of view the interesting thing is the possibility that arises 
through the sexual process of the permutation and combination of different 
factors derived from different lines of descent. A germ-cell may receive addi- 
tions to its collection of factors or be subject to subtractions therefrom, and in 
either case the resulting organism may be more or less conspicuously modified. 

By applying tlie method of experimental hybridisation a most fruitful and 
apparently inexhaustible field of research has been opened up in this direction, 
in the development of which no one has taken a more active part than the present 
President of the British Association. There cannot be the slightest doubt that 
a vast number of characters are inherited in what is called the Mendelian 
manner, and, as they are capable of being separately inherited and interchanged 
witli others by hybridisation, we are justified in believing that they are separately 
represented in the germ-cells by special factors. Important as this result is, 
I belie\e that at the present time there exists a distinct danger of exaggerating 
its significance. The fact that many new and apparently permanent combinations 
of characters may arise through hybridisation, and that the organisms thus pro- 
duced have all the attributes of what we call distinct species, does not justify us 
in accejiting the grotesque view — as it appears to me — that all species have arisen 
by crossing, or even the view that the organism is entirely built up of separately 
transmissible ' unit characters.' 

Batesou tells us that ' Baur has for example crossed species so unlike as 
Aiitirrhinum viajus and molle^ forms differing from each other in almost every 
feature of organisation.' Surely the latter part of this statement cannot be cor- 
rect, for after all Antirrliinuni viajus and molle are both snapdragons, and 
exhibit all the essential characters of snapdragons. 

T think it is a most significant fact that the only characters which appear 
to be inherited in Mendelian fashion are comparatively trivial features of the 
organism which must have arisen during the last stages of phylogeny. This is 
necessarily the case, for any two organisms sufficiently nearly related to be 
capable of crossing are identical as regards the vast majority of their characters. 
It is only those few points in which they differ that remain to be experimented 
on. Moreover, the characters in question appear to be all non-adaptive, having 
no obvious relation to the environment and no particular value in the struggle 
for existence. They are clearly what Weismann calls blastogenic characters, 
originating in the germ-plasm, and are probably identical with the mutations 
of de Vries. These latter are apparently chromatin-determined characters, for, 
as Dr. Gates has recently shown in the case of CFJnotJiera, mutation may result 
from abnormal distribution of the chromosomes in the reduction division.'^ 

We have next to inquire whether or not the Mendelian results are really in 
any way inconsistent with the general theory of evolution outlined in the earlier 
part of this address. Here we are obviously face to face with the old dispute 
between epigenesis and preformation. The theory of ontogeny which I first 

^ Quarttrly Joiirjuil of Microscopical Science, vol. 59, p. 557. 



394 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. 

put forward is clearly epigenetic in character, while the theory of unit characters, 
represented in the germ-cells by separate ' factors,' is hardly less clearly a 
theory of preformation, and of course the conception of definite organ-forming 
substances in the cytoplasm falls under the same category. The point which 
I now wish to emphasise is that the ideas of epigenesis and preformation are not 
inconsistent with one another, and that, as a matter of fact, ontogenetic develop- 
ment is of a dual nature, an epigenesis modified by what is essentially pre- 
formation. 

We liave already dealt briefly with tlie question of organ-forming substances 
in the cytoplasm, and it must, I think, be clear that the existence of these is in 
no way incompatible with a fundamental epigenesis. We shall find directly 
that the same is true of Mendelian ' factors ' or Weismannian ' determinants.' 

We have seen that it is possible to conceive of even a complex organism as 
inheriting nothing from its parent but a minute speck of protoplasm, endowed 
with potential energy, and a sequence of suitable environments, the interaction 
between the two bringing about a similar result in each succeeding generation, 
with a slow progressive evolution due to the operation of the law of accumulation 
of surplus energy. If any of the conditions of development are changed the 
result, as manifested in the organisation of the adult, must undergo a correspond- 
ing modification. Suppose that the chromatin substance of the zygote is partially 
modified in molecular constitution, perhaps by the direct action of the environ- 
ment, as appears to happen in the case of Tower's experiments on mutation in 
the potato beetle, or by the introduction of a different sample of chromatin from 
another individual by hybridisation. What is the germ-plasm now going to do? 
When and how may the changes that have taken place in its constitution be 
expected to manifest themselves in the developing organism ? 

Let us consider what would be likely to happen in the first stages of 
ontogeny. If the germ-plasm had remained unaltered the zygote would have 
divided into blastomeres under the stimuli of the same conditions, both internal 
and external, as those under which the corresponding divisions took place in 
preceding generations. Is the presence of a number of new colloidal multi- 
molecules in the germ-plasm going to prevent this ? The answer to this question 
probably depends partly upon the proportion that the new multimolecules bear 
to the whole mass, and partly upon the nature of the modification that has taken 
place. If the existence of the new multimolecules is incompatible with the 
proper functional activity of the germ-plasm as a whole there is an end of the 
matter. The organism does not develop. If it is not incompatible we must 
suppose that the zygote begins its development as before, but that sooner ot later 
the modification of the germ-plasm will manifest itself in the developing 
organism, in the first instance as a mutation. In cases of hybridisation we may 
get a mixture in varying degrees of the distinguishing characters of the two 
parent forms, or we may get complete dominance of one form over the other 
in the hybrid generation, or we may even get some new form, the result depend- 
ing on the mutual reactions of the different con.stituents of the germ-plasm. 

The organism into which any zygote develops must be a composite body 
deriving its blastogenic characters from different sources ; but this cannot affect 
its fundamental structure, for the two parents must have been alike in all 
essential respects or they could not have interbred, and any important differences 
in the germ-plasm must be confined to the ' factors ' for the differentiating 
characters. The fundamental structure still develops epigenetically on the basis 
of an essentially similar germ-plasm and under essentially similar conditions as 
in the case of each of the two parents, and there is no reason to suppose that 
special ' factors ' have anything to do with it. 

We thus see how new unit characters may be added by mutation and inter- 
changed by hybridisation while the fundamental constitution of the organism 
remains the same and the epigenetic course of development is not seriously 
affected. All characters that arise in this way must be regarded, from the 
point of view of the organism, as chance characters due to chance modifications 
of the germ-plasm, and they appear to have comparatively little influence upon 
the course of evolution. 

One of the most remarkable features of organic evolution is that it results 
ill llic Mdaptation of the or;;anism to its environment, and for this adaptation

uiutatioii and Hybridisation utterly fail to account. Of course the argument of 
natural selection is called in to get over this difficulty. Those organisms which 
happen to exhibit favourable mutations will survive and hand on their advan- 
tages to the next generation, and so on. It has frequently been pointed out 
that this is not sufficient. Mutations occur in all directions, and the chances of 
A favourable one arising are extremely remote. Something more is wanted, and 
this something, it appears to me, is to be found in the direct response of the 
organism to environmental stimuli at all stages of development, whereby in- 
dividual adaptation is secured, and this individual adaptation must arise again 
and again in each succeeding generation. Moreover, the adaptation must, as 
I pointed out before, tend to be progressive, for each successive generation builds 
upon a foundation of accumulated experience and has a better start than its 
predecessors. 

Of coui'se natural selection plays its part, as it must in all cases, even in 
the inorganic world, and I believe that in many cases— as for example in pro- 
tective resemblance and mimicry — that part has been an extremely iiuportant 
one. But much more important than natural .selection appears to me- what 
Baldwin' has termed 'Functional Selection,' selection by the organism itself, 
out of a number of possible reactions, of just those that' are required to meet 
any emergency. As Baldwin puts it, 'It is the organism which secures from 
all its overproduced movements those which are adaptive and beneficial.' 
Natural selection is here replaced by intelligent selection, for I think we must 
agree with Jennings * that we cannot make a distinction between the higher and 
the lower organisms in this respect, and that all purposive reactions, or adjust- 
ments, are essentially intelligent. 

Surely that much-abused philosopher, Lamarck, was not far from the truth 
when he said, ' The production of a new organ in an animal body results from a 
new requirement which continues to make itself felt, and from a new movement 
which this requirement begets and maintains.' ' Is not this merely another way 
of saying that the individual makes adaptive responses to environmental stimuli '! 
Where so many people fall foul of Lamarck is with regard to his belief in the 
inheritance of acquired characters. But in speaking of acquired characters 
Lamarck did not refer to such modifications as mutilations ; he was obviously 
talking of the gradual self -adjustment of the organism to its environment. 

We are told, of course, that such adjustments will only be preserved so long 
a.s the environmental stimuli by which they were originally called for continue 
to exercise their influence. Those who raise this objection are apt to forget that 
this is exactly what happens in evolution, and that the sine qua non of develop- 
ment is the proper maintenance of the appropriate environment, both internal 
and external. Natural selection sees to it that the proper conditions are main- 
tained within very narrow limits. 

A great deal of the confusion that has arisen with regard to the question of 
the inheritance of acquired characters is undoubtedly due to the quite unjustifi- 
able limitation of the idea of ' inheritance " to which we have accustomed our- 
selves. The inheritance of the environment is, as I have already said, just as 
important as the inheritance of the material foundation of the body, and whether 
or not a newly acquired character will be inherited must depend, usually at 
any rate, upon whether or not the conditions under which it arose are inherited. 
It is the fashion nowadays to attach very little importance to somatogenic 
characters in discussing the problem of evolution. The whole fundamental 
structure of the body must, however, according to the epigenetic view, be due to 
the gradual accumulation of characters that arise as the result of the reactions 
of the organism to its environment, and which are therefore somatogenic, at any 
rate in the first instance, though there is reason to believe that some of them 
may find expression in the germ-cells in the formation of organ-forming sub- 
stances, and possibly in other ways. Blastogenic characters which actually 
originate in th&amp; germ-cells appear to be of quite secondary importance. 

We still have to consider the question, How is it that organic evolution has

Jed to the formation of those more or less well-marked grouijs of organisms which 
we call species ? We have to note in the first place that there is no unanimity 
of opinion amongst biologists as to what a species is. Lamarck insisted that 
nature recognises no such things as species, and a great many people at the 
present day are, I think, still of the same opinion. In practice, however, every 
naturalist knows that there are natural groups to which the vast majority of 
individuals can be assigned without any serious diflBculty. Charles Darwin main- 
tained that such groups arose, under the influence of natural selection, through 
gradual divergent evolution and the extinction of intermediate forms. To-day 
we are told by de Vries that species originate as mutations which propagate 
themselves without alteration for a longer or shorter period, and by Lotsy that 
species originate by crossing of more or less distinct foi'ms, though this latter 
theory leaves quite unsolved the problem of where the original forms that crossed 
with one another came from. 

I think a little reflection will convince us that the origin of species is a 
different problem from that of the cause of progressive evolution. We can 
hardly doubt, however, that Darwin was right in attributing prime importance 
to divergent evolution and the disappearance of connecting links. It is obvious 
that this process must give rise to more or less sharply separated groups of 
individuals to which the term species may be applied, and that the differences 
between these species must be attributed ultimately to differences in the response 
of the organism to differing conditions of the environment. It may be urged 
that inasmuch as different species are often found living side by side under 
identical conditions the differences between them cannot have arisen in this way, 
but we may be quite certain that if we knew enough of their past history we 
should find that their ancestors had not always lived under identical conditions. 

The case of flightless birds on oceanic islands is particularly instructive in 
this connection. The only satisfactory way of explaining the existence of such 
birds is by supposing that their ancestors had well developed wings, by the aid 
of which they made their way to the islands from some continental area. The 
conditions of the new environment led to the gradual disuse and consequent 
degeneration of the wings until they either became useless for flight or, in the 
case of the moas, completely disappeared. It would be absurd to maintain 
that any of the existing flightless birds are specifically identical with the 
ancestral flying forms from which they are descended, and it would, it appears to 
me, be equally absurd to suppose that the flightless species arose by mutation or 
by crossing, the same result being produced over and over again on different 
islands and in different groups of birds. This is clearly a case where the 
environment has determined the direction of evolution. 

In such cases there is not the slightest ground for believing that crossing has 
had anything whatever to do with the origin of the different groups to which the 
term species is applied; indeed the study of island faunas in general indicates 
very clearly that the prevention of crossing, by isolation, has been one of the 
chief factors in the divergence of lines of descent and the consequent multipli- 
cation of species, and Eomanes clearly showed that even within the same 
geographical area an identical result may be produced by mutual sterility, which 
is the cause, rather than the result, of specific distinction. 

Species, then, may clearly arise by divergent evolution under changing 
conditions of the environment, and may become separated from one another by 
the extinction of intermediate forms. The environmental stimuli (includincr, of 
course, the body as part of its own environment) may, however, act in two dif- 
ferent ways : (1) -Upon the body itself, at any stage of its development, tending 
to cause adaptation by individual selection of the most appropriate response ; and 
(2) upon the germ-plasm, causing mutations or sudden changes, sports, in fact, 
which appear to have no direct relation whatever to the well-being of the 
organism in which they appear, but to be purely accidental. Such mutations 
are, of course, inherited, and, inasmuch as the great majority of specific 
characters appear to have no adaptive significance, it seems likely that mutation 
has had a great deal to do with the origin of species, though it may have had 
very little to do with progressive evolution. 

Similarly with regard to hybridisation, we know that vast numbers of distinct 
forms, that breed true, may be produced in this way, but they are simply 
due to recombinations of mutational characters in the process of amphimixis, and 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 397 

have very little bearing upon the problem of evolution. If we like to call the 
new groups of individuals that originate thus ' species,' well and good, but it 
only means that we give that name, as a matter of convenience, to any group 
of closely related individuals which are distinguished by recognisable characters 
from the individuals of all other groups, and which hand on those characters to 
their descendants so long as the conditions remain the same. This, perhaps is 
what we should do, and just as we have learnt to regard individuals as the 
temporary offspring of a continuous stream of germ-plasm, so we must regard 
species as the somewhat more permanent but nevertheless temporary offshoots 
of a continuous line of progressive evolution. Individuals are to species what 
the germ-plasm is to individuals. One species does not arif^e from another 
species, but from certain individuals in that species, and when all the individuals 
become so specialised as to lose their power of adaptation, then changes in the 
environment may result in the extinction of that line of descent. 

It is hardly necessary to point out that no explanation that we are able to 
give regarding the causes of either phylogenetic or ontogenetic evolution can be 
complete and exhaustive. Science can never hope to get to the bottom of things 
in any department of knowledge; there is always something remaining beyond 
our reach. If we are asked why an organism chooses the most appropriate 
response to any particular stim.ulus, we may suggest that this is the response 
that relieves it from further stimulation, but we cannot say how it learns to 
choose that response at once in preference to all others. If we are asked to 
account for some particular mutation, we may say that it is due to some modifi- 
cation in the constitution or distribution of the chromosomes in the germ-cells, 
but even if we knew exactly what that modification was, and could express it 
in chemical terms, we could not really say why it produces its particular result 
and no other, any more than the chemist can say why the combination of two 
gases that he calls oxygen and hydrogen gives rise to a liquid that he calls water. 

There is one group of ontogenetic phenomena in particular that seem to defy 
all attempts at mechanistic interpretation. I refer to the phenomena of restitu- 
tion, the power which an organism possesses of restoring the normal condition 
of the body after it has been violently disturbed by some external agent. The 
fact that a. newt is able to regenerate its limbs over and over again after they 
have been removed, or that an echinoderm blastula may be cut in half and 
each half give rise to a perfect larva, is one of the most surprising things in the 
domain of biological science. We cannot, at present at any rate, give any satis- 
factory mechanistic explanation of these facts, and to attribute them to the 
action of some hypothetical Entelechy, after the manner of Professor Hans 
Driesch, is simply an admission of our inability to do so. We can only say that 
in the course of its evolution each organism acquires an individuality or whole- 
ness of its own, and that one of the fundamental properties of living organisms 
is to maintain that individuality. They are able to do this in a variety of 
ways, and can sometimes even replace a lost organ out of material quite different 
from that from which the organ in question is normally developed, as in the 
case of the regeneration of the lens of the eye from tha iris in the newt. That 
there must be some mechanism involved in such cases is, of course, self-evident, 
and we know that that mechanism may sometimes go wrong and produce 
monstrous and unworkable results ; but it is, I think, equally evident that the 
organism must possess some power of directing the course of events, so as 
generally to secure the appropriate result; and it is just this power of directing 
chemical and physical processes, and thus employiuig them in its own interests, 
that distinguishes a living organism from an inanimate object. 

In conclusion I ought, perhaps, to apoloigise for the somewhat dogmatic tone 
of my remarks. I must ask you to believe, however, that this does not arise 
from any desire on my part to dogmatise, but merely from the necessity of 
compressing what I wished to say into a totally inadequate space. Many years of 
patient work are still needed before we can hope to solve, even approximately, 
the problem of organic evolution, but it seemed to me permissible, on the 
present occasion, to indulge in a general survey of the situation, and see how 
far it might be possible to reconcile conflicting views and bring together a 
number of ideas derived from many sources in one consistent theory.

3. Some Notes on a Collection of A^istralian Frogs. 
By J. Booth, M.C.E., B.Sc. 

The work of which this paper is the outcome was undertaken in the hope 
of finding some method of determination and identification of Batrachian 
species, without resort to the slight dissection necessary to examine the sternal 
apparatus and the sacral vertebrae. The material made use of was the col- 
lection of frogs at the Melbourne University, together with some of the speci- 
mens from the National Museum, and a few privately collected. 

In accordance with this original intention, stress was laid on external shape, 
and in order to render the description of shape more definite the particulars 
were expressed as far as possible numerically and in proportional measurements. 
The length of the specimen, from snout to vent, was taken as a basis, and 
other dimensions expressed in terms of it. 

To facilitate these measurements, a scale was devised, by which the length 
of the specimen in millimetres, and other dimensions in proportional units, 
could easily be read off from the callipers. The particulars selected as most 
satisfactory for measurement were : — The depth of the chest ; the length and 
breadth of the head ; the length of the snout ; the distances from eye to nostril, 
and between the nares; tlie diameter of the orbit; the width of the upper 
eyelid; the distance between the orbits; the diameter of the tympanum, and 
distance from tympanum to eye; the length of hind limb; and the length of 
the digits of the hand. Tliese dimensions have been tabulated for a large number 
of specimens. 

It was found that the description and measurement of external features 
could not replace observations of the skeletal girdles, the variations in which 
seem to be of paramount genetic significance ; while the external configuration 
and aspect is more related to the mode of life of the animals, and largely 
corresponds with the classification into : — swimming, climbing or tree, and 
burrowing or cryptic frogs. 

In the course of the work the relative value of the external characters 
came under review. Of these, amount of webbing on the toes seems to have 
been overrated. Professor Spencer having pointed out how very variable this 
character is in several species collected by him in the interior. Colour and 
markings are very definite in some cases, remarkably variable in others ; but 
usually varying in such a way as to suggest a normal form from which the 
rest may be derived. This normal is probably to be found in strongly marked 
young specimens. Of particular markings, the vertebral line, in some species 
constant, in others, though normal, vai'ies in distinctness to total absence, and 
again in others is very definitely present or absent. Another normal marking 
is the lateral face-streak, and nearly all face colourations may be considered 
as variations of this. An external feature closely connected with habit is the 
adpression of the thigh to the groin. In some species this gives rise to a 
diiference of colour and texture in the concealed parts, while in others the 
groin is fully exposed and does not differ from the general surface. 

With regard to classification, the scheme of the British Museum Catalogue, 
as applied to Australian frogs, becomes reduced to three families of the 
Arcifera, Cystigjiatliidcv, Hylidcp, and Bufonid(c, and (on account of the record 
of three species of the genus Austrochnperina, Fry) the family Bonidce of the 
Firmisterna. 

A list of the Australian species, with references to descriptions and notes 
on the specimens examined, and tables of the proportionally measured dimen- 
sions, were appended.

4. Specii's of ]'icioria)i Lam-preiiR. By J. A. Leach, D.Sc. 

Ricliardson (1848) was the first to name an Australian lamprey {Pcfromi/zon 
mordax). 

Gray, in the British Museum Catalogue (1851), made Richardson's sporimen 
the type of his genus Mordacia, and made two other Australian lampreys the 
types of his genera Geotria and Velasia. 

Giinther, in 'The Catalogue of Fishes in the British Museum' (1870), 
accepted Mordacia mordax, but included Vehisia in the genus Geotria. Giinther 
later gave the name Geotria allportii to a Tasmanian specimen. Ogilby and 
Regan both include this species in Geotria australis. 

Count Castlenau (1872) created two new genera founded on immature forms, 
tlius increasing the Australian species to six. Ogilby (1894), in 'A Monograph 
of the Australian Marsipobranchii,' reduced the species and genera to three. 
He revived Gray's genus Vehisia and named the Au.«tralian form F. stenostoma, 
though he did not specify characters to separate it from V. cinlcnsis. 

Plate included Velasia in Geotria, but separated G. stenostoma from 
G. cMlensis ; he considered that both occur in Australia. 

Regan, in 'A Synopsis of the Marsipobranchs of the Order Hijperoartii ' 
(1911), placed the Australian species in G. stenostoma and restricted the species 
G. chdensis to South America. He created a new species {G. saccifera) for a 
New Zealand specimen of the pouched form. 

An examination of forty-six specimens of lampreys in the University Museum 
and National Museum, IMelbourne, showed two species of Mordacia, and that a 
new species of Geotria is required for specimens intermediate between the 
broad-headed, pouched form and the narrow-headed Velasia form ; as these 
connect the two extremes it is unnecessary to retain Velasia as a separate 
genus. 

The gr€at_ var'iation in the chief characters, and the small number of 
lampreys available for examination, are imdoubtedly the chief causes of the 
creation of so many species, and the discarding of these by subsequent workers. 

The horny teeth are easily removed and the appearance of the mouth after 
their removal is different. The state of distension of the mouth revealing the 
whole of the teeth or the points only of the tongue teeth and supraoral teeth is 
important in determining the appearance of these structures. Even the teeth 
of the supraoral laminas, a generic characteristic, at least, vary. Plate figures a 
Geotria with five cusps instead of four on the supraoral lamina. One Mordacia 
examined has four pointed cusps on one lamina, while the lamina of the other 
side has three. Castlenau said : ' I find the greatest difliculty in the determina- 
tion of the Victorian fishes of this family. . . . The most important character, 
the dentition, seems to be subject to the most extraordinary variations ; in fact' 
I cannot find it exactly similar in two specimens.' 

Regan used the relation of the length of the first dorsal fin to the distance 
betw^een the two dorsal fins as one of three distinguishing characters. In six 
specimens of Geotria chdensis taken alive during an eel fare at the Hopkins 
River Falls near Warrnambool, the interspace varied from -6 of the length of the 
fin to 1-3 times the length, a variation of over 100 per cent. Regan us'ed this as 
one of three variable characters when separating nine specimens°of Geotria into 
four species. 

Ogilby regarded the presence of pores on Velasia as a generic character. 
Pores occur on all the specimens of Geotria and Velasia examined. On one large 
pouched Geotria australis the pores form a definite 'lateral line.' Plate figured 
pores on each species he recognised. 

The pouch is a puzzle. It is not a secondary sexual character for it occurs in 
both sexes. 

It seems necessary to recognise five species of Victorian lampreys.

Aluminium bands of different sizes stamped with the address ' Witherby,

400 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. 

open-sided ring which can readily be passed over the tarsus of a bird and 
closed, taking care that it can move easily between the foot and the knee, and 
the bird is then released. 

The species number, date, locality, and circumstances are recorded on a 
form supplied with each packet of twenty rings. These rings are issued by 
Messrs. Witherby to subscribers to their magazine ' British Birds ' who are 
willing to assist, and are carefully registered. 

When one of these marked birds is recaptured and the incident reported the 
information is added to the register, and from these details an annual report 
with maps is prepared, and published by Messr.s. Witherby under the auspices 
of the British Ornithologists' Club, the eighth, for 1913, being now ready. Thus 
the ultimate course and length of bird migration will be defined. 

It is requested that all wild birds may be ringed, as it is found that even the 
most constant varieties wander to considerable distances. 

A very large number of rings have been utilised, and about five per cent, of 
these retaken and reported. In addition to the English scheme, this work is 
being carried on by Professor Mortensen from Viborg in Denmark, and by others 
in Germany. The results are most encouraging. Adult swallows marked in 
pairs have been traced from Ayrshire and Staffordshire in England to Natal and 
the Orange Free State in Africa, and back to Staffordshire, but in each case 
only one of the pair has been retaken as they always have new mates. 

Nestlings seldom return to their birth-place. Thrushes, blackbirds, and 
robins marked in England have been recaptured in Ireland and France. Cor- 
morants, nestlings from Wexfoid in Ireland, in Finisterre, Brittany, Portugal, 
and Spain ; mallard and wild duck in France ; a pochard I marked in Warwick- 
shire vpas retaken six months later at Butzow in Mecklenburg ; a turtle-dove in 
Portugal. 

Abroad the same work has been carried on since 1898, and a starling from 
Ilussia reached Yorkshire ; a widgeon from Denmark reached Wales ; tufted diuk 
from Finland reached Ireland, and a Prussian black-headed gull was recaptured 
in Norfolk.

1. On Scent-Distributing Apparatus in the Lepidoplera. 
By F. A. DixEY, M.D., F.R.S. 

Tt is well known that certain specialised scales found in various situations 
on the winns, bodies, and limbs of Lepidoptera are concerned in the distribution 
of a scent, which in many cases is characteristic of the species. These scales 
may occur in both sexes, but certain forms of them have only been found in 
males ; among these are the plume-scales of the Pierines and Nymphalines. 
The Pierine plume-scale often affords a ready means of identifying the species, 
and is frequently of service in throwing light on r^uestions of affinity. Thus, 
the interesting butterfly Leuciacrin acuta Roths, and Jord., recently discovered 
in New Guinea, has been considered by some authorities to be nearly akin to 
the African genus Pinacopteri/x, and by others to the Aiistralasian genus 
Elodina. But the scent-scales with which it is abundantly furnished bear no 
resemblance to those of any Pinacopteryx, while Elodina appears to be entirely 
devoid of these structures. On the other hand, the scent-scales of Leuciacria 
strongly recall those of Delia.?, a genus well represented in the Australian 
Province, and especially so in New C4ninea. Scales of a somewhat similar 
character are also found in Huphina, another genus with an Oriental and Aus- 
tralasian distribution, and probably not far removed from Delias in point of 
affinity. In a further structural feature Leuciacria is nearer to Hxiphina than it 
is to Delias, and it may possibly turn out to be a connecting link between these 
two assemblages. But from the evidence of the scent-scales it seems safe to 
conclude that such resemblance as exists to Pinacopteryx and Elodina is only 
superficial. The well-known ' battledore scales ' that occur on the wings of 
Lycaenids furnish a means of separating two species, Pleheivs cegon and P. 
argyrognomon, which ars often indistinguishable by ordinary methods of 
examination. 

In some cases, though not in all, a special adaptation exists with the object 
of economising the scent until it is required for purposes of sexual recognition 
or attraction. The costal folds of the forewing in many Hesperids, noticed by 
Doubleday and Westwood, and first adeifuately described by Fritz Miiller, are 
examples" of this kind of provision. Another structural feature serving the 
same purpose is the collection of the scent-distributing scales into a patch on 
that portion of the fore or hind wing which is covered in the position^ of rest. 
This arrangement is seen in many Pierines; it occurs also in Satyrines and 
Nymphalines. No example of a male characterised by special scent-scales was 
known to Fritz Miiller among the Erycinids. Such, however, do exist; as, for 
example, in the genera Mesosemia and Parrdemos, where the scent-patches 
occlude one another in the attitude of rest, as notably in the genus Dismorphin

among the Pierinea. The structure of these scent-distributors among the 
Lepidoptera is still to a large extent an unexplored field, and their study affords 
a promising subject for further investigation. 



2. Dhriixfiinn nii Mimicry in Australian Insecls, inlrotlueecl bii 
Professor E. B. Poulton, F.B.S. 

It is extremely interesting to compare the phenomena of mimicry as they are 
exhibited in the different parts of the world. We find that the models in each 
tropical region are as a rule related, and often very closely related, to those of 
the other regions. Nevertheless, in spite of these relationships, the models 
commonly exhibit patterns which are peculiar to each region. Thus the 
Danaime and their allies, the tropical American Itlwmiirm, always tend to be 
mimicked by other butterflies, although their patterns in each of the great 
tropical regions are for the most part very different from those in the others. 
The same conclusions emerge when other great groups of models are compared, 
and the whole body of facts affords strong indirect evidence in support of the 
hypothesis that mimicry is an advantageous resemblance which has grown up 
under the influence of natural selection. 

Australia is the most isolated of all the inhabited continental tracts on the 
earth's surface, and its isolation is reflected in its peculiar fauna and flora. How 
far is it reflected in the insect-models and their mimics? Up to the present 
time the subject has been but little studied in Australian material, but we can 
nevertheless see our way to certain conclusions of much interest. 

Perhaps the most widely spread models in the world are the black yellow- 
handed stinging Hymenoptera. The central members of these powerful com- 
binations are wasps (Diploptera), around which are ranged sand-wasi&gt;s (Fossores), 
and. in far smaller numbers, bees (Anthophila), followed by mimetic species 
of the Phytophagous Hymenoptera, and of other order.? — Diptera, Coleoptera, 
Lepidoptera, etc. " Throughout this dominant combination of models and mimics 
the subcylindrical body is black, encircled by many bright yellow bands. 
Although widespread over the world it is especially _ powerful in the north 
temperate zone. In Australia, however, its place is taken by a combination 
with a very distinct pattern. The bands are deep bro\Ynish orange instead of 
bright yellow, and they are few and broad instead of many and narrow. This 
pattern runs through a" large and complex set of models and mimics. It is very 
convincing to compare such a mimetic Asilid fly as the European Asilus 
crabroniformis with the Australian species, and to observe how their very 
different patterns resemble those of the respective Aculeate models. An equally 
significant comparison may be drawn between the mimetic Longicorn beetles of 
these two parts of the world. 

The conspicuous sluggish Lycid beetles form another dominant group of 
models in all the tropical regions, and here, too, a powerful Australian com- 
bination exhibits a peculiar colouring, and in some respects a peculiar 
constitution. 

Material already received from Commander J. J. Walker In the Sydney 
district and from ^Ir. A. Eland Shaw at Ilealesville, Victoria, shows that the 
Australian contribution to the study of mimicry is sure to be of the highest 
interest and importance.

2. Some Features in the Diurnal Migrations of Pipits, Wagtails, and 
Sivallo7VS, as observed at Tuslcar Roch TAglit -Station, Co. Wex- 
ford. By Professor C. J. Patten, M.A., M.D., Sc.T). 

In certain periods of spring and autumn a stream or procession of migrants 
passes the Tuskar Rock Light-station daily. Owing to the barren nature of the 
Rock — wave-swept to a large extent in rough weather — paucity of food, and lack 
nf fresh water, comparatively few of the travellers descend and alight. As they 
hasten past, the altitude of their i^iglit relative to the level of the lantern is a 
matter of interest, seeing that so many nocturnal migrants strike the glass. 

Most birds direct their flight towards the land, i.e., S.E. to N.W. or due 
E. to W. Even birds presumably on emigration seem to make for the land. 
Pipits and wagtails travel about twenty miles an hour ; swallows and martins 
about 90 miles an hour. On account of the very limited area of the Rock and 
the considerable altitude at which many of the birds fly, the descending flight 
for the purpose of alighting, when attempted, is almost perpendicular. Several 
original photographs from life of the specie.=i dealt with in this paper have been 
secured and used as illustrations.

The following Papers were read : — 

1. Dr. B. C. L. Perkins' Researclies on the Colour-fl roups of Hawaiian 
Wasps. By Professor E. B. Poulton, F.E.S. 

Dr. Perkins' researches, recorded in ' Fauna Hawaiicnsis,' in ' Proc. Ent. 
Soc, Lond.,' 1912, p. hi, and 'Trans. Ent. Soc, Lond..' 1912, p. G77, have 
thrown a flood of light upon the evolution of colour-groujjs in one of the most 
i.solated of all the land areas that afford favourable conditions for a fauna and 
flora. It is probable that the comparatively simple phenomena exhibited in the 
.Sandwich I.slands will be found to have a special bearing upon the infinitely more 
complex conditions found in the most isolated of the inhabited continents. 

Tlie only indigenous wasps of the Sandwich Lslands belong to the genus 
Odijnerus (in the broad sense), and Dr. Perkins concludes that the 102 species 
have been derived from two original immigrants — a black, yellow-banded .species 
from some unknown direction, and at a much later but still very ancient date, 
a black, dark-winged species probably from Asia. The latter is extremely 
dominant, but it found the islands already occupied, and has thus only split 
up into four species, as against the ninety-eight produced by the original invader. 

Dr. Perkins similarly concludes that the fifty-three indigenous bees, all 
belonging to the genus A^csoprosopis, and the eighteen indigenous Fossores 
(CrnhronidcE) were derived respectively from a single Asiatic immigrant bee and 
a single Asiatic Crabronid. 

This assemblage of closely related species of wasps has formed colour-groups 
in the different islands, attracting also many of the species of bees and Fossores. 

Kauai, the most N.W. island, possesses only one important colour-group — 
black, dark-winged insects with two white or yellow bands. Here the pattern 
of the earliest immigrant wasp was probably retained, although combined with 
dark wings, perhaps due to mimicry of the second immigrant. The latter on 
Kauai has given rise to species with yellow bands. 

Oahu, the next island proceeding in a S.E. direction, has four colour- 
groups, of which two resemble that on Kauai in the possession by some species 
of pale bands, although fainter than in the N.W. island. Another group con- 
taining black, dark-winged insects is probably due to a mimetic approach 
towards the second original immigrant, a very abundant insect. The fourth 
group is much marked with red. 

D r&gt; 2 



404 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. 

On Maui, Molokai, and Lanai there are three groups, one red-marked, one 
black and dark-winged, and one with pale bands on some of its species. 

On the largest island, Hawaii, in the S.E., all the groups tend to fuse into 
a single large assemblage of black, dark-winged insects. 

The species form structural groups of which the members, although obviously 
closely related, enter different colour-groups in the various islands. In other 
words, the colour-grouping is entirely independent of zoological affinity. 



2. The Development of Trypanosomcs in the Invertebrate Host. 
By Professor E. A. Minchin, F.R.S. 

If an analysis and c6mparison be made of those instances in which it can be 
claimed that the development of a given species of trypanosome in its invertebrate 
host is known in at least its principal traits, it is seen at once that in every 
such instance there is a part of the developmental cycle which is constant in 
occurrence and uniform in character, and another part which is of inconstant 
occurrence and very variable in character. 

In the constant part of the cycle the parasite always assumes the crithidial 
type of structure and multiplies incessantly in this form to produce a lasting 
stock of the parasite, certain individuals of which change sporadically from the 
crithidial into the trypaniform type and so become the final, propagative form of 
the development, destined to pass back into the vertebrate host and establish the 
infection in it. During hunger-periods the crithidial forms may pass tem- 
porarily, in some cases, into the resting, non-flagellated leishmanial form, until 
food is again abundant, when they form a new flagellum and revert to the 
crithidial tvpe of structure. 

The inconstant part of the cycle, when it occurs, is intercalated at the very 
beginning of the development in the invertebrate, and las'ts but a relatively 
.short time; it is derived directly from the trypanosomcs taken up by the 
invertebrate from the vertebrate host, and takes the form of an active multipli- 
cation of the parasites in either the trypaniform or leishmanial condition. In 
the cases where this early multiplicative phase is wanting altogether, the 
trypanosomcs talcen up by the invertebrate host pass at once into the crithidial 
phase. 

When a further compari.^on is made between the development of trypanosomcs 
in the invertebrate host and the development of the closely allied species of 
Vritliidia and Lcptomonas which have no alternation of hosts or generations, 
but are confined during their entire life-history to particular species of inverte- 
brate hosts, it is seen at once that the life-cycles of these parasites of inverte- 
brates are similar in all essential points to the crithidial phases of trypanosomcs 
in their invertebrate hosts. It is evident, therefore, that the crithidial phase in 
the development of a trypanosome is to be interpreted as a reversion to, or 
recapitulation of, the type of development that occurred in the ancestral form 
which was originally a parasite of the invertebrate alone, before it had obtained 
a footing in the vertebrate host or had acquired the trypanosome-like type of 
structure ; while the multiplicative phases of variable character preceding the 
crithidial phase in trypanosome-development are to be regarded as having been 
intercalated secondarily into the life-cycle and of no pliylogenetic significance. 



3. A Comparison of the Sizes of the Red Cells of some Vertebrates. 
By J. Burton Clel.\nd, M.D. 

In searching blood-films from Australian birds for parasites, it was noticed 
that the red corpuscles of a heron were distinctly larger than those of the 
various Passerine birds examined. This led to systematic measurements of the 
sizes of the red cells of various Australian vertebrates. The slides examined 
have been all stained by ' dry ' methods, wet fixation and staining methods 
being impracticable in the field. Experience shows, however^ that this method 
maj' be relied on for the purpose in view. 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. 405 

Amongst the fishes, the Dipnoi have enormous red cells, those of (Jtiatodus 
forstcri being 39 X 23 to 25 /u. The Elasmobranchs have also large cells, 
varying from 18x12-5 to 23x13*5 jit Amongst Teleostean fishes the size is much 
smaller. The cells are also rounder. In Therapion unicolor they are nearly 
spherical in size 6 to 8 ju. Other species range from 9x7 up to 13-5 x 10-3 /t 
in a catfish. 

The reptilia, snakes, lizards, and tortoises have red coi'puscles ranging usually 
from 16 to 21x9 to 11 ;u, though in some cases, as in the genus Hyfjosoma, the 
size tends to be smaller (14 to 16x8 to 10 ^). 

Batrachians show red cells usually of from 18 to 20x10 to 14 /t. 

Amongst birds, the emu has the largest (15-5 to 16-5 x8"5 to 9"5 fi.). The 
Pcdicipediformes, Sphenisciformes, Ardeiformes, and Pelecaniformes come next 
(approximately 14x8 ix.) Charadriiformes are generally a little smaller. The 
pigeons, hawks, parrots, kingfishers, and cuckoos come next, the kingfishers 
being perhaps the largest of these. In the Passerine birds there is a definite 
tendency to smaller cells, ranging from 10 to 12x5 to 7 /t, with the exception 
of the family Corvidse, where the size approximates more to the previous group. 

These figures seem to indicat-e that with specialisation has eventually come, 
both in fishes and in birds, a diminution in size of the red cells. The cumber- 
some corpuscles of C'eratodus have doubtless played a part in the gradual 
extinction of the Dipnoan fishes. The relationship of the various classes to each 
other is clearly shown in the size of the red cells. 



4. Notes on some AiislraUaii HcBniatozoa. 
By J. BuBTON Cleland, M.D. 

Owing to the geographical isolation of Australia, the study of the blood para- 
sites of the vertebrates, especially of such as have no easy means of passing 
over stretches of ocean, is of considerable interest. In some cases, such as the 
marsupials, interesting speculation arises as to whether the Hsematozoa found 
in them reached Australia (1) with the marsupials when these originally came ; 
or (2) as parasites of the invertebrate host by a separate arrival; or (3) whether 
their appearance represented the adaptation in Australia of a parasite, at one 
time confined to an invertebrate host, to a habitat partly in the vertebrate and 
partly in the invertebrate host. 

In marsupials Haemogregarines have been found. Breuil has recorded in a 
bat the presence of a Trypanosonie and of a Plasmodium. In birds, Plasmodiuvi 
precox has been recorded in a falcon, and a Plasmodium has been found in the 
black swan. Plasmodium has also been recorded in the introduced sparrow. 
Plasmodium seems to be rare in birds compared with the presence of Halteridium. 
Halteridia are common in -Australian birds, and have been found in all tha 
States with the exception of Tasmania, though they have been found on 
Flinders Island in Bass Straits. The appearances of the forms found vary 
somewhat, suggesting specific differences. Trypanosomes have been found in 
several species, but seem confined more especially to Queensland and northern 
New South Wales. With the same distribution, and often in the same infected 
birds, large parasites may be found in distended red cells. The parasite in the 
red cell is spherical and indents the nucleus of the host-cell, which is stretched 
over it so as to form a cap. I am of opinion that this is the intracorpuscular 
form of the Trypanosome with which it is usually associated, although my 
former colleague, Dr. Harvey Johnston, who was associated with me in first 
describing this form, has since referred to it as a Leucocytozoon, as does 
Breinl. The corpuscles are certainly not elongated in the remarkable way in 
which they are in infections by Leucocytozoon ziema7inii. Microfilariae are 
common in birds.

somes and Haemogregarines are met with in tortoises, as well as a Haemo-

in the water lizard, Pliysiijnatlius lusueurii.

5. Adtiptatioii and Inheritance in Silktcorins. 
By Professor Otto Maas. 

The experiments in the feeding of silkworms on the leaves of our well-known 
vegetable Scorzonera hispanica, formerly undertaken by Harz, Tichomiroff, and 
others, for practical purposes, have been repeated by me on theoretical grounds, 
as v.ell as by different methods. 

As none of the breeds cultivated by Harz's selective method have survived, 
selection appears not to operate at the length of generations, and consequently 
the much-vexed question of the heredity of acquired characters cannot be oinitted. 
General constitution, ' Wiichsigkeit,' plays its part as well ; qualities are trans- 
ferred according to now well-known laws of heredity, especially Mendel's, the 
breeds have to be analysed, in this regard as well, and crossings of normally 
fed with Scorzonera-fed are to be tried. 

Hence the necessity for working on a larger scale, which I began (&lt;after 
some orientating experiments in 1910 and 1911, on the possibility of feeding 
and selecting some breeds) in 1912. The same material for breeds has to be culti- 
vated in different places, to avoid local failures ; different races of silkworms 
have to be tried on the same food, and different feeding on the same race 
(mulberry, Scorzonera, and half Scorzonera and half mulberry), in order to get 
a material for suitable crossings, and to produce new possibilities. 

In accordance with Kellogg, in spite of all gradations, four main types may 
b© distinguished, of which I used chiefly three (with different eggs, colours, 
and shape of cocoons and moth-pattern), designated here for ronvenience witli 
the letters Jap., It., and T., and of these three races different giada- 
tions have, been applied ; for instance, Japanese freshly imported, and Japanese 
cultivated for years in Europe; Japanese of the wild form {mundurina) ; Italians, 
whose parents had been fed by myself, 1911, with Scorzonera, and others normal 
from the sericultural institutions; Tessin normal and with Scorzonera-fed parents, 
&amp;c. Results of the 1912 feeding are, among others : (1) the It. and T., whose 
parents had Scorzonera, 1911, did not get well through the same treatment, but 
died out in spite of every care, in several localities, whereas the freshly imported 
Jap., It., and the normal T. sustained the new food comparatively well. (2) Still 
Scorzonera-fed in 1912 held together with mulberry-fed ones of the same race &amp;c. 
show great differences. A much smaller percentage comes to the respective 
moultings, much longer time is required (fifty-six days instead of thirty-six), and 
there is especially a long hesitating and wandering period of the big, well-fed, 
worm, till it begins to spin. (3) Its cocoon, however, is not inferior, either in 
size, density, or strength of thread. The crossings of the various breeds show 
marked differences in their productiveness. The capacity of fertilisation (active 
and passive) of Scorzonera moths, even of first-)-ate cocoons, is apparently much 
inferior (this can be verified not only by general comparison, but also by trying, 
for instance, the .same male with different females and vice versa) ; fecundity, 
judged by the number of deposited eggs in the same race, is much less; in many 
cases the females could not fasten their eggs (though that was here not a race 
character). Also of the fertili.?ed eggs many more decay than in normal egg- 
deposits, and of the remaining a much smaller number is able to hatch in the 
next year (c. infra). 

All these damages are most significant, if both parents are Scorzonera-fed 
(thus a number of possibilities are at once excluded from further propagation), 
while in the case where one parent was normally fed the mating could be as 
fertile as a normal one. In 1912 all possibilities of race-crossings and treatment 
were tried (a distinction also was made if the male had Scorzonera and the 
female mulberry or cict verga), altogether over thirty, which formed the starting 
material for 1913. 

Of these egg-deposits single ones always have been selected (to work on 
' pure lines ' for other jiurposes. of which I shall give an account elsewhere), 



TRAILS ACTIONS OF SECTION D. 407 

but of the remainder a number were always of equal descent regarding race, food 
in male and female, &amp;c. Those have been united respectively, to form ' popula- 
tions,' and such populations have been divided and distributed again in 1913 in 
different localities, and also with different gradations of food, so that last year 
more than thirty different breeds on different treatments, altogether more than 
a hundred, have been raised by myself and by my assistants. 

In spite of the local dispersion or just on account of its impartiality the 
result has been very uniform. Almost all the breeds resulting from both 
Scorzonera-fed parents, even the well hatched, caused much more dithculty in 
raising with Scorzonera again, died out, or came to spin only in small percentage, 
while the Scorzonera X mulberry or mulberry x Scorzonera breeds showed a strong 
advantage and combined, so to say, the ' adaptation ' of one parent with the 
healthy state of the other (still more some of the half-Scorzonera, half-mulberry- 
fed combinations), and seem to be superior to pure mulberry descendants in 
strength, and in faculty of going through the Scorzonera treatment to spinning. 
(That may be valid, of course, only for a certain number of the offspring, which 
number follows the Mendelian law.) 

Whether really ' crossing favours adaptation ' can be decided by this year's 
(1914) breedings ; a further gradation prepared by corresponding copulte of 1913. 
These copulee have been tried as much as possible within the same race to 
avoid confusion, but with the utmost possible variety of Scorzonera handicap- 
ping, as the grandparents besides the parents have to be considered. 

For instance, I., the 1911 bree.d, both parents 1913 Scorzonera-fed; (o) all 
four grandparents 1912 Scorzonera-fed; (6) both grandparents of one side 1912 
Scorzonera-fed, of the other side Scorzonera X mulberry (= three " grandparents 
Scorzonera, one mulberry-fed). Further gradations to male and female: (c) 
grandparents on both sides Scorzonera X mulberry-fed or on one side both 
grandparents Scorzonera-fed, on the other both mulberry-fed ( = two grandparents 
Scorzonera, two mulberry-fed), but in different combinations; (d) grandparents 
of one side Scorzonera X mulberry, of the other both mulberry-fed (one grand- 
parent Scorzonera, three mulberry-fed) ; (e) different combinations of the half- 
Scorzonera-mulberry grandparents [i.v. fed up to the fourth moulting; with 
Scorzonera, then with mulberry). 

II. Of the parents in 1913 one with mulberry (grandparents also mulberry), 
tlie other parent with Scorzonera (grandparents various gradations, vide I.), i&amp;c. 

Tlie results of 1914, as far as I can check them at present, have confirmed 
tliose of 1912 and 1913, giving corresponding gradations of the crossed and of 
the pure breeds with regard to their adaptation to the Scorzonera. treatment. 
Of some biological results, the instincts of the young worms to attack and leave 
different kinds of food, their tropisms, I shall give an account elsewhere, also 
of some special experiments of inheritance relating to the melanism, called 
the ' moricuiwl,' to the ' sport ' of ' non-spinners,' or abnormal ' atavistic ' wing- 
patterns.

TUESDAY, AUGUST 25. 
The following Papers were read : — 

1. Studies on Echinoderin Larvae. By Dr. T. Mortensen. 



2. On tlie Worm Parasites of Tropical Queensland. By Dr. W. Nicol. 

It is only five years ago since the study of worm parasites was taken up 
systematically in Australia. Eiirlier work had been of a desultory nature. In 
tropical Australia little work was done until the foundation of the Australian 
Institute of Tropical Medicine; since then a large and representative collection 
lias Ijeen made. This paper gives a brief account of that collection. 



408 TRANSAOTIONt; OF SECTION 1). 

The most common human parasites are the hook -worms [Ankylosloma and 
Nicator). Other human parasites are not more common than in temperate parts, 
while liydatids are much rarer than in other parts of Australia. The parasites 
of domesticated a,nimals have not received much attention and only a few 
scattered records occur. The most outstanding parasite of the dog is Diro- 
filarta immitis, which infects the heart and lungs and appears to cause much 
mortality. In rats the characteristic parasite is the large Echinorhynch, 
Gigantorhynchus moniliforiim. 

The parasites of marsupials and monotremes are interesting. Filuria worms 
are fairly common in wallabies and opossums, while wallabies frequently har- 
bour a large mass of Strongylids in their stomach. The Echidna is frequently 
infected with tapeworms and a curious little red, spiral-shaped Nematode 
hitherto midescribed. Similar Nematodes occur in fruit bats and snakes. Not 
the least interesting mammalian parasite 'is that described by !S. J. Johnston 
from the dugong, a Trematode which possesses an entirely new type of structure. 

The birds do not show many parasites that are peculiarly Australian or 
tropical. This is probably due to their migratory habits. The reptiles and 
frogs afford several forms which are typically Australian and a few which 
appear to be essentially tropical. 

It is amongst the fishes that we find the most distinctive parasite famia. 
This applies particularly to Trematodes, and it will probably be found that a 
large proportion of the Australian Trematode parasites of fishes represent new 
generic types, and in some cases perhaps new family types. 

On the migration of Onchourea lurvcc through the capsule of the luorm nodule. 

The life-history of the parasitic worm which causes nodular disease in cattle 
still remains a mystery. A considerable amount of experimental work has been 
done on the subject, but few positive results have been obtained. 

In 1911 T. H. Johnston published a summary of the work which had been 
done wp to that date, and came to the conclusion that the most probable inter- 
mediary host is a mosquito, a louse, or a cattle-Hy. Since that time four 
important contributions have been added by Australian workers. The first of 
these was by Cleland, who made the discovery that some calves which had been 
reared on Milsom Island, New South Wales, and had never left the island, had 
become infected with worm nodules. This showed that all the factors con- 
cerned in the transmission of the disease are present on the island, and therefore 
narrows the scope of investigation considerably. Cleland came to the con- 
clusion that a biting fly or a mosquito is the most probable intermediate host. 

The second paper is by Gilruth and Sweet, who concluded that fresh 
infection only occurred in young animals. They showed that direct infection is 
improbable, and formed the opinion that some biting insect is the most likely 
transmitter. 

On the other hand Breuil performed some experiments which seemed to 
indicate the possibility of infection by means of water. He was able to induce 
larvK tu penetrate the unbroken skin and to emerge into water, where they lived 
a short time. His attempts, however, to infect various aquatic animals with 
these larvae were not successful. Quite recently Cleland has published further 
observations. He found that Onchocerca larvue could be ingested by the stable- 
liy {Stomoxys) and live in it for several days, but he could detect no develop- 
ment in these larvte. He also discovered free adult worms in cattle, making 
their way through the tissues of the hind leg from the foot upwards. 

It was with the view of confirming Breuil's experiments that the present 
work was undertaken. The technique employed was similar, but various modifi- 
cations were adopted to ascertain the effect of temperature, rainfall, &amp;c. In 
none of the thirty experiments, however, was any positive result obtained. 

The procedure consisted in applying sterile water on a calico pad or in a 
glass vessel to the shaved skin over a nodule, and examining the water a few 
hours later. The negative results obtained in these experiments show that some 
factor was lacking which was present in Breuil's investigations. 

Further experiments were {)erformed with nodules excised from slaughtered 
cattle. These nodules were immersed in water under varying conditions for 



TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION B. iOd 

different lengths of time, and both the water and the nodule were examined 
thereafter for the presence of larvte. 

The earlier experiments were not very successful, but they showed that a 
few larvee could make their escape from the nodule into the water. Later 
experiments, however, showed that the larvpe could emerge through the worm 
capsule in large numbers, and fairly continuously for some time after the death 
of their host. 

The effect of acid and alkali was tried, but they did not appear to stimidate 
the emergence of the larv?e from the nodules. Increase of temperature also 
was not found favoui'able. 

All the nodules used were carefully examined both before and after the 
experiments to ensure that no tear or rupture was present in the capsule. 
Damaged nodules were rejected. 

In further experiments of the same nature certain nodules were fixed after 
varying periods of immersion in water, and thereafter cut into serial sections. 
In most of the nodules larviB were found in considerable numbers in the wall 
of the capsule. Usually they were uniformly distributed in one or more layers, 
corresponding to the denser strata of the capsule. The impression was received 
that the water had some definite effect upon the worm mass inside the nodule, 
stimulating the larvse to make their escape through the capsule. This effect 
was not usually produced until after several hours' immersion. 

It is worthy of note that the adult worms were found to live for more than 
two days after removal from this host, and that living larvae continued to 
escape from the capsule for at least three days. Attempts to keep the larvae 
alive in water were not successful, as they did not survive for more than forty- 
eight hours at room temperature. 

The results of these experiments go to show that Onchocerca larvae can and 
do make their escape through the capsule of the worm nodule, usually in small 
numbers^ but at times or in some cases in comparatively large numbers. These 
results do not necessarily support the theory of water-borne infection, but they 
show that, even if the infection be insect-borne, it is not necessary to suppose, 
as has been done, that at some period of its life the worm sheds its larvae into 
the blood stream. The numbers of larvaj escaping from the nodules are suffi- 
cient to ensure a moderate chance of infection in any biting insect. The fact 
that the larviv may be induced to penetrate the unbroken skin by the applica- 
tion of water may be merely an accident, but it shows that the larvse find 
their way very close to the surface, and may therefore be very readily ingested 
by any biting insects. 

3. Joint Discussion with Sections C, E, and K on Past and Present 
Pielations of Antarctica in their Biological, Geograpliical, and 
Geological Aspects. 

Sir Douglas Mawson : I propose to deal particularly with recent geographi- 
cal advances in Antarctica and to lay special stress upon the work which has 
been performed by the Australasian Expedition. We are now all satisfied that 
there is a great continent at the southern extremity of the world. Possibly, 
were the ice to be melted, there would be, not one large land unit, but several. 
We feel sure, however, that there would be at least one large elevated piece of 
land in the Australian Quadrant,' but there are many who hold that there 
would be at least a second piece represented by the land south of America, 
sometimes called West Antarctica. It is, indeed, probable that this latter mass 
would be found to be split up into a number of small isolated fragments. 

South Victoria Land and the Ross Sea Region have been explored or touched 
upon by eight expeditions, of which several, particularly those of Scott, Shackle- 
tou, and Amundsen, have accomplished important land work. In Victoria 

' For convenience the Antarctic Regions may be considered as divided into 
four Quadrants, commencing from the meridian of Greenwich, and each nanied 
after the lands or seas to the north : hence, African Quadrant, Australian 
Quadrant, i'acific Quadrant, and American Quadrant. 



410 TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION D. 

Land the continent rises to great heights, at least 12,000 or 15,000 feet behig 
visible from the sea. Indeed, Amundsen reports finding mountains up to 
19,000 feet in height near the Pole itself. Little was known of the extension 
of _ the continent to the west of Victoria Land until recently, when the Austral- 
asian Antarctic Expedition visited that region. Two expeditions in 1840, one 
French and one American, spent a short time in those seas, but neither landed 
upon the mainland, though the French reached a rocky islet off the coast. They 
both saw parts of the mainland, but their reports were vague, and served only 
to stimulate interest in that portion of Antarctica. 

The 60 degrees of that portion of Antarctica to which we sailed some three 
years ago then jiresented really a virgin field. Now we have brought back the in- 
formation that it is continuous land, and that it is covered by a very thick and 
solid ice-cap, which tiows out from the central portions of that high continent. 
In that portion the coast-line is not anything like so steep and precipitous as on 
the Eoss Sea side. The German Expedition of 1901 made tlie land at what they 
called Gaussberg, just to the west of the Australian Quadrant. Their ship was 
frozen into the pack some distance from the land, and they sledged to the latter 
during the winter, but time did not permit of any extensive land work. The 
Swedish Expedition in 1901 and several French expeditions since then have 
done very good work south of America, amplifying the outline already started in 
that region long ago. A joint British and Swedish Expedition — in the course of 
preparation— proposes to carry on the work in that locality. The Scottish 
Expedition of a few years ago sighted the continental ice-sheet at what they called 
Coats Land, in the Weddell Sea. There it is a steep, straight ice-face — nothing 
but ice — which rises inland to considerable heights. The German Expedition 
of 1911, the same period as our own expedition, reached what appears to be 
the southern extremity of the Weddell Sea, and actually sighted rocky land 
beyond the ice coast. However, they were prevented from doing any land" work. 
It now remains for future expeditions- to tell iis exactlv what exists south of 
the Weddell Sea. 

Of the African Quadrant practically nothing is known. It has been sighted 
only in one place — Eudcrby Land — by a whaler in 1820. Though the discovery 
of Endcrby Land has not since been checked, I feel certain of its existence, 
after comparing the meteorological conditions logged by Briscoe in that neigh- 
bourhood and those met by us off Adelie Land in the same latitude further east. 
The Pacific Quadrant also is almost a blank, nothing being known excei^ting 
King Edward Land on the extreme west. 

After surveying the geographical data available we conclude that there is 
about the South Pole a continent of about 5,000,000 square miles in area. It 
consists almost entirely of a great ice-cap, rocks seldom out-cropping excepting 
actually upon the coast. 

I will confine my subsequent remarks to the 60° of the Australian Quadrant 
entered by our own expedition. The voyages of the S.Y. Aurora are so 
numerous that, to save confusion, I shall refer only to the more important. 
In Macquarie Island, a subantarctic possession of Tasmania in 55° S. lat., we 
had a party of five stationed for two years, making a complete examination of 
that fascinating island, and sending up to Australia by wireless regular daily 
weather messages. Adelie Land was the situation of our main Antarctic base, 
wliere eighteen of us wintered and carried out a general scientific and geographi- 
cal programme for two years. When the wireless was working well, messages 
were sent up to Australia by relaying through Macquarie Island. About 1,100 
miles west of the !Main Base station was our western Antarctic base, under the 
charge of Mr. Franlv Wild. The party consisted of eight men all told. As 
the ship had not been able to reach solid land in that vicinity, on account of 
solid floe-ice, the party had wintered actually on a floating shell-ice formation — 
the Shackleton Ice-shelf — seventeen miles from new land, called Queen Mary 
Land. Between the two Antarctic bases much new land had been met by 
Captain Davis. In other places the ship sailed over what had been marked as 
land from vague reports of the early explorers. In 1840 mapping was neces- 
sarily rougher than at the present time, but Wilkes particularly exceeded the 
allowable errors in his charting. I have come to the conclusion that Wilkes's 
mistakes ha\e arisen from errors of judgment in mistaking solid pack-ice for 



TEA2JS ACTIONS OP SECTION t). 411 

land. It is not difficult to fall into such errors, but an appreciation of tlie 
possibility of such errors leads one to wait until further proof is obtained 
before stating that any apparent landfall is actually land. The mirage effects, 
when looking over pack-ice, are sometimes very misleading. There is no time 
to deal in detail with the errors discovered in Wilkes's charts. Only in one 
place, Adelie Land, did we find land where shown on the American charts. In 
several other places the existence of land was disproved. Elsewhere the ice 
conditions were adverse, so that we were not able to penetrate as far as Wilkes, 
with the result that several of his landfalls still call for confirmation. Though 
Captain Davis was not able to push the ship sufficiently far south to get a view 
of Knox Land, strong confirmation of its existence is afforded by the data 
acquired by us on land and sea in that neighbourhood; in fact our soundin&lt;^s 
show that even if Wilkes's landfalls between Adelie Land and Queen Mary 
Land be out, the borders of the continent will be found not far to the south. 

[Then followed further reference to the work of the Australasian Antarctic 
Expedition, profusely illustrated by means of lantern slides, some of which were 
colour-photographs. The points dealt with were the following :— 

1. Extensive sledging journeys in Adelie Land, King George Land, and Queen 
Mary Land; the aggregate of all journeys, including supporting parties, exceeded 
4,00U miles. 

2. The use made uf wirelcf-s telegraphy to fix a fundamental meridian in 
Adelie Land. 

3. The continent south of Australia is of the nature of a high plateau, risin^^ 
to 3,000 feet within twenty miles of the coast, but continuing steadily to rise 
further to the south. Tlie coasts are, for the most part, of the nature of ice 
cliffs,vvherc the ice-cap at the water-front still rides *on a rocky bottom. Only 
occa.sionally do rocky capes break the icy monotony. 

4. Floating extensions of the land-ice arc met with at interval;^, sometimes 
as tongues from the valley depressions of the borders of the continent, at other 
times as immense aprons. The most notable of the latter, named the Shackleton 
Shelt, extends 180 miles from tiic land. 

5. A fiinge of rocky or ice-capped islets is a feature of much of the coast. 

G. Tlic Continental 8helf is remarkable for its inshore trough : this appears to 
be a regular feature. As one passes out to sea tlie water at first deepens, then 
shoals, before finally plunging down into the ocean depths. 

7. The ship's party carried out extensive oceanographic investigations 
including a large number of deep-sea soundings. ' 

8. Biological collections were made at each of the three land bases and 
from the ship ; dredgings were made in depths down to 2,000 fathoms. On land 
the eggs of the Antarctic petrel and of the silver-grey petrel were found for the 
first time, and several new birds and their eggs were added to the collection. 
On Macquarie Island a special study was made of sea-elephants. 

9. The rocks of Adelie Land and Queen Mary Land nroved to be chiefiy very 
ancient gneisses and schists. At Cape Hunter in Adelie Land an a"ncient 
sedimentary series, in part phyllites, is to be seen. On the coast of King George 
Land there extended for many miles rocky cliffs 1,000 feet in height ; the upper 
half is columnar dolerite, below is a sedinientary series containing bands of coal 
and carbonaceous shales. Woody matter was dredged up at several points along 

the Antarctic coa.st. At Macquarie Island the rocks are chiefly igneous for 

the most part gabbros. Everywhei'e the island has been overridden by ice, 
leaving behind many small glacial lakes and a mantle of till. 

10. The simultaneous records obtained by three stations, each about 1,000 
miles apart, and all in an entirely new sphere, from which no figures have before 
been returned, will prove of great value when worked up. The weather con- 
ditions at Macquarie Island were ' wirelessed ' up to the Commonwealth Weather 
Bureau every day for two years. During a part of the time it was found possible 
to do the same from Adelie Land. In Adelie Land the most terrific climate 
ever recorded was found to inevail. The average wind velocity for the j^ear 
was found to be 50 miles per hour. It sometimes blew at 90 miles per hour for 
24 hours; velocities of over 100 miles [ler hour were often reached, and on one 



412 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. 

occasion IIG milea were recorded in a single hour. When the wind came down 
in cyclonic gusts it often exceeded a puft velocity of 200 miles per hour. The 
instrument used for ascertaining the average hourly velocities was the self- 
recording Robinson cup-anemometer. 

11. An unusually extensive magnetic record was obtained, including con- 
tinuous magnetograph curves at Cape Denison for a period of eighteen months. 
This station is the nearest yet established to the South Magnetic Pole. A series 
of careful field determinations were made to within a few miles of the Magnetic 
Pole. Systematic observations of the Aurora Polaris were made in conjunction 
with the magnetic and wireless observations. 

12. In Adelie Land special account was taken of bacteriology.] 

Mr. GfiiFFiTH Tayloe : The present brief account of my work on Captain 
Scott's Expedition deals with regions near 78° S., extending from Granite 
Harbour to Mount Discovery. 

The walls of all the glacial valleys, as well as the mighty Scarp of Lister, 
show a series of stages of glacial sculpture which are believed to illustrate a 
process of evolution. Snow-slopes give rise to couloirs which can be seen passing 
into rounded forms or ' half-funnels ' (in Granite Harbour) and so into true 
cwms (or cirques). In suitable localities (such as below Mt. Lister) headward 
erosion has changed a cwm into a ' finger valley.' These with other higher 
cwms tend to form a radiating system resembling the relation of the fingers to 
the knuckles of a hand. 

Great glacial troughs or Trog-taler are well shown in the Ferrar and Taylor 
Valleys. The latter is free from snow or ice for twenty miles ; and it is crossed 
by several barriers or 'Eiegel.' 

Exam^jles of erosion by planation arise rarely under present circumstances. 
Most of the glaciers are comparatively free from debris and their drainage 
waters are clear instead of milky. Striae are infrequent. There is much water 
during summer, as along the Koettlitz Glacier, which is drained by the twenty- 
mile long Alph River. 

The glaciers exert little pressure at their sides, and are usually bounded by 
a lateral moat, often over a hundred feet deep. Wind, water, and ' freeze and 
thaw ' are potent agents here in carrying off the results of erosion, which is 
chiefly due to ' freeze and thaw.' 

The Eiegel (bars) of the Taylor Valley closely resemble those of the European 
Alps. The largest is 3,000 feet high and almost blocks the Valley where the 
latter is four miles wide. A narrow defile 1,600 feet deep and about 400 yards 
wide is cut through its northern end ; lilce the defiles of Bergun, Faido, Mesocco, 
&amp;c., in the South-East Alps. 

The cwm and finger valleys are bounded by steep ridges 1,000 feet high (:is 
at Devil's Bowl and Davis Valley). They could not be cut out by normal 
glacial erosion] moreover, they are often only a mile or two in length. 

It is suggested that the ' palimpsest ' theory welds these two difficulties of 
Riegel and cwm erosion. The cwm erosion headward cutting occurred first, 
possibly, along pre-glacial valleys, and cut out finger valleys and steps, which 
later were overwhelmed by true outlet glaciers flowing out from the Ice Plateau. 
Thus the Riegel are relics of the old cwm-heads. The basins were excavated by 
nivation round the slowly receding snouts of almost stagnant glaciers. 

The by-gone separation of the Ferrar and Taylor Valleys is described, 
though now they are apposed in Siamese-twin fashion. 

Professor T. W. Edgworth David : In regard to Mr. Taylor's able 
exposition of cwm erosion, I think he has proved his point, for many of these 
valleys which have been so deeply recessed into that huge strip of land which 
may be called the Antarctic ' horst. ' I would suggest, however, that Ave must 
not press that cwm theory too far. We must expect, and really do find, evi- 
dence of transverse faulting in the so-called ' Beacon Sandstone ' formation. The 
Beardmore and the Mackay glacier valley .s represent, to my mind, regions of 
cross faulting and downward slipping which have produced low points in the 
horst, sagged areas forming in the great rampart of the range low gaps through 
which the inland-ice has overflowed into Ross Sea. In the case of the main 



TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION D. 'll 3 

outlet valleys, I do not think that we should ascribe their whole exravation to 
the work of cwm glaciers. I do not know w-hether Mr. Taylor would press for 
that. These main valleys seem partly tectonic, partly glacial, and very possibly, 
in their earliest inception, partly fluviatile. 

Next, in regard to the Great Ice Barrier, the Ross Barrier — the huge 
equilateral triangle with sides about five hundred miles in length — is fed by a 
very large number of glaciers. It has been said by some that it is merely sea- 
ice thickened by additions of annual snows going on for thousands of years, 
until at last a thick mass results of sea-ice at the base, while the snow's and 
neves of a thousand or more years form the remainder of its bulk. I would 
point out that if that were the case, we would surely expect the Ross Barrier 
to have a pretty oven cliff facing the ocean. But we do not find that condition 
at all ; we find it is very variable in height — from twenty feet in some places to 
a hundred and fifty feet in others. As this thickness is so extremely uneven, it 
seems to me probable that the Ross Barrier is composed, certainly in its inland 
portion, and probably in its se&lt;a face, of the fanned-out ribs of glacier-ice derived 
from the contributing glacier valleys which pour into its sides, both from the 
south-east and from the south-west. I think, then, that this great variability of 
thickness is proof that there is something more than mere sea-ice and old 
neve deposits (not but what the latter is an important contributor) helping to 
form that wonderful ice-mass, which was, perhaps, paralleled by the Pleistocene 
North Sea ice-sheet of Europe, which impinged upon the shores of Yorkshire, 
and produced those big lakes near York itself. 

Next the question has been raised as to whether the land-mass of Antarctica 
has been fixed at the South Pole from early geological times, or whether it has 
migrated. In Cambrian times we know that there was an extensive development 
of the Arch»ocyathino3 limestones. These have been described by Mr. Taylor. 
Quite lately great blocks of Archreoc'yathinre limestone, dredged by Dr. W. R. 
Bruce from depths of about 1,700 fathoms to the north of the Weddell Sea, 
have been identified as such by Dr. Gordon. There is evidently a great develop, 
ment of these Archapocyathinng limestones both on the Australian and on the 
American side of Antarctica. Mr. Taylor has shown that the Archfeocyathiuc'c 
never extended into the tropical portions of the world, and on the whole were, 
therefore, probably inhabitants of cool waters. This evidence suggests that the 
axis of rotation of the earth, so far as the Southern Hemisphere, and probably 
the Northern Hemisphere too, are concerned, was perhaps approximately where 
it is now, even as far back as Cambrian time. One cannot, of course, press this 
statement until a great many more localities for the occurrence of the Archreo- 
cyathinfe have been identified. The problem of the occurrence of a Permo- 
Carboniferous flora within 5° of the South Pole itself will no doubt be touched 
upon by Professor Seward. 

In regard to the possible biological analogue of modern Antarctica with 
Permo-Carboniferous Australia it may be stated that in Antarctica we find an 
abundance of the ' sea mats,' a feature which attracted special comment as far 
back as the date of Sir James C. Ross's Expedition. Similarly, we find that 
Fenestellidre are very common in our Permo-Carboniferous beds, both in the 
Lower and Upper Marine Series, both of which are partly glacial in origin. 

In the Antarctic we find a large pecten, Pectcn Colhechi, enormously 
abundant in the raised beaches, where it dominates every other form of mollusc. 
Also in Antarctica we find that sponge spicules are extraordinarily abundant ; 
indeed, the floor of the Ross Sea must be as white as snow with sponge spicules. 
In the Permo-Carboniferous rocks of N.S. Wales large Aviculopectens are very 
numerous, and sponge spicules not uncommon. 

A point which I wish to emphasise because it is perhaps new, is that in our 
Permo-Carboniferous rocks we have a widespread development of curious mineral 
in our marine semi-glacial beds, to which we have given the name of ' glen- 
donite.' This glendonite is associated with glacial erratics; we find it parti- 
culai'ly in our Upper Marine Permo-Carboniferous rocks. It is a pseudomorph 
after glauberite. Sir Thomas H. Holland tells us that, in Lake Sambha in 
Rajputana, soda sulphates, with a little sodium chloride, are concentrated and 
thrown out in the water in winter, on account of the sulphates being less soluble 
in cold water. Mr. H. T. Ferrar, to whom members of the Shackleton 



414 TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION T&gt;. 

Expedition are very deeply indebted for his valuable work on geological Antarc- 
tica, has shown that soda sulphate, mirabilite, now crystallises out in Antarctica, 
as confirmed by my colleague, R. E. Priestley. It is only in our Permo- 
Carboniferous rocks, where we obtain indications of ice action, that we also find 
these glendonites ; therefore it seems to me that, inasmuch as they were developed 
in association with glacial erratics, probably the water at that time was very 
cold. 

Next I should like to emphasise the fact that Antarctica is meteorologically 
a great force centre, and that its presence in the Southern Hemisphere is of 
the utmost importance to the inhabitants of Australia, not only for the under- 
standing of the past distribution of animals and plants, but particularly from 
the point of view of meteorology. There can be no question that if Antarctica 
were wiped off the map now, there would be much less stirring up of the 
atmosphere in the Southern Hemisphere than there is to-day. There is no 
doubt that Antarctica acts as a great refrigerator of the atmosphere, causing a 
steady down-draught, and it is on this account that it is a big factor in 
Australian meteorology. 

In conclusion, may I state that I consider Sir Douglas Mawson has done 
a great work for science in establishing the meteorological wireless station at 
Macquarie Island, now taken over by the Federal Government? When one 
thinks of the great benefit that results from the more accurate weather fore- 
casting made possible by this station, forecasting on the accuracy of whicli 
not only so many industries but the very lives of our sailors depend, one feels 
that all the money expended on Antarctic expeditions, all the hardship and 
suffering, and even loss of heroic life, that they involve, are justified by the gain 
to scientific knowledge in the service of Innnanity. 

Professor Pexck : I desiie only to make a few remaiks as to the geological 
structure of Antarctica. It seems to me there is a very great difference in tho 
geological structure of the western and eastern parts of Antarctica. Along tlie 
l^eardmore Glacier there is no trace of mountain-making by folding since the 
Palaeozoic age. On the other hand, the region south of South America has the 
structure of the Andes, and it has been shown tliat there are the same rocks in 
the western part of South America as in western Graham Land, and a very 
similar section of Mesozoic rocks in Patagonia and in eastern Graham Land. 
We see in Australia the counterpart of eastern Antarctica. How are these two 
parts of Antarctica joined together? I think this is still a very open question, 
and one which offers a wide field for future exploration. 

Mr. H. T. Ferrar : Firstly. I would point out that the hill marked J on the 
' Discovery ' maps is separated from the foot of the Royal Society Scarp by a 
transverse valley which we called the Snow Valley. On a sledge journey up the 
Blue Glacier we were able to look along this valley and recognise Mount Kempe 
standing at its southern end : on a journey to the summit of Brown Island we 
were able to see into this valley over the tops of the Southern Foothills which 
have a sharp and definite crest. One of the lantern slides just shown by 
Mr. Taylor exhibited a long cloud hanging as a festoon along the scarp of the 
Royal Society Range, and reaching from the northern foot of Mount Kempe 
up to the western foot of the hill J, which I think betrays the presence of this 
transverse valley, although its existence is denied by Mr. Taylor. I do not 
agree with Mr. Taylor that these ' finger-valleys,' as he terms them, head in the 
corries of the Royal Society Range. I think the ice-masses in them are remnants 
of glaciers which once had their origin on the east face of the Royal Society 
Range, and then pushed across the transverse valley into McMurdo Sound. The 
ice-masses have now slipped away from their sources, and are the ' ice-.slabs ' 
shown somewhat conventionally on the ' Discovery ' maps. The late Dr. Wilson 
at the south end. and myself at the north end of the Southern Foothills, proved 
that the ice in these so-called finger-valleys does not now meet that shed from 
the Royal Society Scarp. I think Mr. Taylor journeyed too close in under these 
foothills to realise that this transverse valley really exists. 

Secondly, we had the good fortune to see the Royal Society Range from 
several points of view, and to us it stood out as an obloid crust-block with a 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. 415 

transverse valley (the Emmanuel Glacier) separating it from the hinterlantl of 
this latitude. 

Thirdly, the three valleys indicated on the ' Discovery ' ma]is to the north- 
ward of the Inland Forts probably have some connection with the Wright and 
Debenham outlet glaciers mapped by Mr. Taylor's party on their journey to and 
from Granite Harbour. 

With regard to the Great Ice Barrier, I agree with Professor David as to 
the origin of the ice of the Ross Barrier and other floating Piedmont glaciers, 
and hold to my view that they are due to the inland-ice draining through the 
outlet valleys, and crowding npon itself on the coastal platform of the continent. 

[The following slides were then exhibited : — 

(1) The Admiralty Range, showing fault-block ranges of mountains. 

(2) The Beacon Heights, with no suggestion that the Beacon Sandstone on 
the sides of the Ferrar Glacier was other than a single formation intruded by 
sills of dolerite. 

(3) The iCathedral Rocks (with granite hills in the foreground), showing the 
rocks in ascending order which go to build up this portion of Antarctica. 

(4) The Kukri Hills — a line of junction between schists and gneisses only 
slightly eroded by a glacier occupying what is probably a fault-trace. 

(5) A view of Knob Head Mountain, to explain the movement of the ice of 
the Ferrar Glacier and of the South West Arm, into Taylor Valley. 

(6) The Inland Forts, rasped but hardly eroded by the ice which once passed 
between them from the Ferrar Glacier over into another drainage system. 

(7) The channel between ice and rock at the foot of Knob Head Mountain, 
.showing how spur-truncation is brought about by the agency of water rather 
than by a rock-charged ice-rasp; also uplift of englacial material where two ice- 
stream s mt!et. 

A map of Antarctica and the Southern Seas was next referred to; the east- 
west folds of South Africa and Victoria (Australia) were indicated, as was also 
the submarine furrow between this ridge uiul that of the Crozets, Kerguelen. 
&amp;c., and yet another furrow between this island-ridge and the main coast of 
the Antarctic, and reference was called to the late Dr. J. Milne's view that east- 
west belts of the earth's crust were more rigid than meridional belts. 

Antarctica itself would seem to have been subjected to a torsional stress, 
which was relieved by rupture along a meridional line now marked by the steep 
coast of South Victoria Land. That portion embracing Coats Land, Enderby 
Land, Adelie Land, and South Victoria Land stood firm, while that portion 
now beneath the Ro.ss Sea and including p]dward VII. Land foundered; owing 
to gain in angular velocity consequent on the earth's rotation it foundered east- 
ward, and slipped round in an easterly direction until retarded by some obstacle 
near the longitude of Cape Horn. The pressures created by this retardation 
probably caused the crustal buckle or Andean fold of the Graham Land region.] 

Mr. F. Stillwell : At Commonwealth Bay in Adelie Land is a small rocky 
promontory of about half a square mile in area. Around it were found sUght 
evidences of recent relative uplift. The rock itself was a gneissic granite, which 
was very fresh and showed very little surface weathering. (Samples on the 
table indicated the fresh character of the rock at sea-level.) Inland was another 
exposure of rock which, in contrast to the sea-level rock, showed marked weather 
ing. This inland rock was similar in character to the sea-level rock, and had 
evidently been exposed a much longer time, and it clearly showedthat the sea- 
level rock had not been exposed sufficiently long to weather. The ice-ablation in 
the winter months was considerable and amounted to about four inches, and 
exceeded the summer accretion. It is quite possible then, that Point Denison 
has been exposed within the last hundred years— a very recent change. From 
the accounts of the second Base Party, 1,100 miles westwards from Adelie Land, 
the snow-accretion seemed to be in excess of the snow-ablation. The conditions 
thus appear to be variable in this quadrant of the Antarctic. 

Captain John K. Davis : Much has been said regarding the past and present 
of Antarctica; I propose to say a few words on future investigation, which 
will so greatly benefit by the work of those who have gone before. Land 



416 TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION D. 

journeys, important as they are, must be supplemented by the investigation of 
the coast line if we are to progress towards the completion of an outline map 
of Antarctica. The Antarctic Coast line has been estimated by Professor 
David at 15,000 miles, only 4,000 of which have been explored ; it is high time 
that a complete circumnavigation of the Continent was undertaken and its out- 
lines correctly laid down upon our maps. 

The Australasian Antarctic Expedition -under Sir Donglas Mawson may be 
said to have begun this work of circumnavigation. Sixty "degrees of longitude 
in the Australian Quadrant were investigated by this expedition. When heavy 
pack made a near approach to the coast impossible, the aid of the sounding 
machine was invoked, and supplied evidence as to the probable distance of 
the land. As a result of the voyages of the ' Aurora,' a complete section of the 
.«ea-floor between Hobart and the Antarctic is available. This section shows the 
big rise 200 miles south of Hobart, where the water shoaled over 1,000 fathoms 
in 50 miles. This rise was traced for a considerable distance on a southerly 
course (about 125 miles). The least depth found on this ridge was 545 fathoms. 
Compared with soundings taken in adjacent waters to the east and west, which 
ranged from 2,700 to 1,670 fathoms, it may be conjectured that the ridge rises 
at least 10,000 feet above the general level of the sea-floor in the neighbourhood. 
The bottom for the most part is hard and rocky, but no specimens of the rock 
were obtained. Further south another smaller rise was indicated — investigation 
in this locality will probably disclose others. Improved methods, and the ex- 
perience gained by recent expeditions should enable future explorers to return 
not only with a map of the lands they have seen, but also with a knowledge 
of the floor of the ocean over which they have sailed. 

The work of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition ended at Gaussberg. 
From this point another 90° of longitude stretch westward known as the African 
Quadrant, the most promising field for exploration remaining in the Antarctic. 

An interesting feature of the work of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition 
was that close to the position assigned by Wilkes to Termination Land a huge 
ice- formation (of the same type as the Ross Barrier) extending over 160 miles 
from the mainland was discovered. The seaward end of this formation was 
named by us Termination Barrier Tongue, its position is one of considerable 
interest in view of the unsuccessful attempts of the ' Challenger ' and the 
' Gauss ' to locate Termination Land further west. 

Lieut. Wilkes, in his narrative of the voyage of the ' Vincennes ' wrote as 
follows : — ' On February 17 (1840) about 10 a.m. we discovered the barrier 
extending in a line ahead and running north and south as far as the eye could 
reach [this evidently refers to a line of pack-ice]. Appearances of land were also 
seen to the south-west, and its trending seemed to be to the northward. We 
were thus cut off from any further progress to the westward, and obliged to 
retrace our steps ... we were now in longitude 97° 37' E. and latitude 
60° 01' S.' Tlie appearance of land referred to was placed on the published 
charts of the expedition nearly fifty miles from the position given above and 
named Termination Land. Allowance being made for the difficulty of obtainhig 
precise longitude in those days, everything points to the fact that Wilkes did 
sight the great ice-tongue we afterwards rediscovered. 

The configuration of the great inlet in the pack-ice as shown on Wilkes's 
chart, and named Repulse Bay, made it evident to us that some obstruction 
(either land- or barrier-ice) interfered with the free passage of the pack-ice 
to the west ; our subsequent discovery confirmed this belief, and provided the 
confirmation given as to the accuracy of the work of this courageous pioneer in 
the locality. 

Professor R. N. Rudmose Brown : Professor Penck has referred to the 
importance of the structure of Antarctica. That, to my mind, is the chief 
geographical problem to be solved in the Antarctic. There has been speculation 
as to whether Antarctica is one land mass, or two with a strait between them. 
It seems to me there is no room for that strait across Antarctica, because of 
the discoveries by Shackleton and Amundsen of the land bounding the Ross 
Sea. On the Weddell Sea side discovery has left a gap in the coast line, where 
there is certainly room for the strait, and yet probabilities are against it. 



TRAKSACTIONS OF SECTION 1). 417 

It is in that region of the Wcddell Sea where the doubtful Morrcll Land or 
New South Greenland is placed. Without going into all the evidence regarding 
jSIorrcll, this mucli I would like to say, that nobody has ever sailed ovei- the 
position of jMorrell Land, or disproved tlie position of it since it was first 
reported, l^oss, a very cautious explorer, reported appearance of land about its 
northern e.xtremity. The Scottish Expedition could not get into that region 
becau.se of the heavy ice, but the soundings seemed to shelve towards Morrdl 
Land. It is true that Lieut. Filchner reported that he disproved Morrell Land ; 
however, he did not go sufficiently far west to sight it, so his statement is of 
no value. 

The Weddell Sea has been very much neglected. The Ross Sea cjuarter has 
had great attention paid to it, probably because it is the nearest and most 
direct way to the Pole. 

Nobody has yet landed on Coats Land, nor on Leopold Land. There was no 
possibility of landing on the ice-cliff of Coats Land when the ' Scotia ' dis- 
covered it in 1904; but there was no doubt whatever about that ice-cliff being 
a part of the ice-cap pouring off the continental land. The deep-sea soundings 
and deposits by themselves showed that, but what I would like to emphasise 
is this : that Coats Land seerned to rise in the interim- to great heights, but 
we were not certain of the distance of these heights. Most of us, and particu- 
larly those with longer sight and more experience in polar seas, were convinced 
that this w-as the plateau rising into the interior to heights of perhaps lo.OOO 
or 15,000 feet. Future exploration will, 1 believe, conifirm this. It is to b# 
hoped that Sir Ernest Shackletou will be enabled to start on his trans-continental 
expedition, because he will score a new track across Antarctica, and incidentally 
will solve this problem of the strurtui-e of Antarctica towards the Weddell Sea. 

Dr. G. C. Simpson : I desire to refer to only one matter connected with the 
Antarctic. I do not think we realise sufficiently that tlie southern hemisphere 
is much colder than the northern hemisphere, and the reason for this difference 
in temperature is certainly not understood by scientists. When we think of the 
temperature of a place, we think of the temperature in the lower atmosphere. 
Now the mere passage of light through the atmosphere will not warm it. The 
main method in which the atmosphere becomes warmed up is by the sun shining 
on something it can warm. Now, in the Northern Hemisphere there are large 
masses of land which can absorb the sun's energy, and then give the heat to tlie 
atmosphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, on the contrary, the whole mas.s of 
land within the Antarctic continent is covered with ice which is practically 
a perfect reflector, and therefore when the sun shines on to it a large proportion 
of the energy is reflected into space. I do not think scientists have quite 
realised how important that is — that 5,000,000 square miles of the eai-th's surface 
in the Southern Hemisphere reflect into space a large part of the energy received 
from the sun. I feel certain that this is one of the chief reasons for the 
difference in temperature between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. 

jNIr. Charles Hedley : Naturalists have deduced the age, climate, contour, 
fauna and flora of Tertiary Antarctica from the nature of the Antarctic refugees 
now living in southern lands. Biologists note that many similar forms, either 
recent or fossil, are repeated in various southern islands or continents. For 
instance, there are the monotremes, once perhaps a numerous group, of which 
two widely different types survive in Australia, Tasmania, and Papua. The 
bones of other monotremes occur in South American deposits. Then there are 
the Thylacines, recent in Tasmania, and fossil in South America and Australia. 
Either we must consider that these groups arose independently in each 
hemisphere, or that they spread from the one to the other. In the latter case, 
a South Polar land offered the most direct way from home to home. The 
simplest explanation of the distribution of marsupials, past and present, is that 
they originated in South America, spread by way of Archihelenis to Western 
Europe, by way of the West Indies to North America, and by way of 
Antarctica to Australasia. 

Turning to the Amphibia, both the Hylid.T and the CystignathidiP have 
their chiei seat in South America ; both extend to Australasia, where they

are best developed in the south-east, and gradually vanish before reaching the 
Moluccas. Here again the most direct road between the two centres lies across 
Antarctica. By cumulative evidence from plants, both cryptogams and 
phanerogams, from animals, both vertebrate and invertebrate, of many and of 
varied types, we are led to the conclusion that the way they might have gone 
was the way they actually went. 

A problem which geographers seek to solve is — whether there are now one 
or two Antarcticas, and again we may ask whether in the Miocene there was one 
Antarctica or two Antarcticas ? If there was only one, why did it not distri- 
bute its faunal contents evenly between Australia and New Zealand ? But if 
there were two, or more, did one contribute to tlie population of New Zealand, 
and another to that of Australia ? 

Though the fauna and flora of New Zealand are obviously indebted to 
Tertiary Antarctica, yet New Zealand has not received any of the verte- 
brates mentioned ; there are neither monotremes, marsupials, Hylidse, nor 
Cystignathidaa. Further, the differences are positive as well as negative. In 
New Zealand there is a group of earthworms, the Acanthodrilids which recur in 
South America, but not in Tasmania or Australia. The fuchsias, which are 
mostly South American, have a few outliei's in New Zealand, but none in Tas- 
mania ; the bushy Veronicas are mostly from New Zealand, but there are a few 
in South America, and none in Tasmania. 

The Antarctic constituent in the Australian flora and fauna includes both a 
frigid and a subtropical element. How was it that both these incompatible 
elements could issue from the same source ? The answer offered is that then, as 
now, a high plateau existed in central Antarctica, where the frig-id forms had 
their station, while the subtropical species existed on the coast. While the 
climate cooled, the land-link between Antarctica and Tasmania endured till 
the alpines in their turn followed the retreat of the subtropical forms 
northwards. 

The conclusions reached from this comparison of southern flora and fauna 
are that: (1) at or about the Miocene a subtropical climate prevailed within 
the Antarctic circle; (2) before, during, or after this warm epoch, land exten- 
sions jutted north from Antarctica to New Zealand, to Patagonia and to Tas- 
mania; (3) southern floras and faunas availed themselves of the opportunities 
for migration offered by these extensions. Eelics of these migrations are our 
only evidence of such changes of land and climate. 

Professor A. C. Seward gave a brief account, illustrated with lantern 
slides, of some of the fossil plants collected by members of Captain Scott's 
second expedition, with special reference to Dr. Wilson's discovery of Glossopteris 
in latitude 85° South. Fragments of well-preserved leaves of Glossoj^feris indica 
found in the rocks of Buckley Island, a nunatak on the Beardmore glacier, 
afford important evidence both as to the age of the Beacon Sandstone formation 
and as to a former connection between Antarctica and Gondwana Land. The 
geological distribution of Glossopteris in other parts of the world suggests that 
the strata of the Buckley Nunatak must be assigned to the Permo-Carboni- 
ferous period. In addition to Glossopteris, the Polar party found fragments of 
gymnospermous wood and impure beds of coal. Mr. Priestley, a member of 
Commander Campbell's party, obtained a large piece of petrified wood from a 
sandstone boulder on the Priestley glacier in latitude 74° S., which on investi- 
gation proved to be a gymnospermous stem of considerable botanical interest ; 
the wood shows well-marked rings of growth and exhibits Araucarian charac- 
teristics, but in view of the possession of certain peculiar features it has been 
described under a new generic name as AntarctlcoxyJon Prifstlci/i. This stem, 
though particularly interesting from a botanical point of view and as demon- 
strating the occurrence of well-grown trees on the Antarctic continent, does not 
afford any conclusive evidence of geological age. Associated with the partially 
decayed tissues of Antarcticoxylon was found a winged pollen-grain, described 
as Piti/osporites sp., which bears a striking resemblance to the pollen of recent 
Abietineae. 

In conclusion, reference was made to the bearing of these important dis- 
coveries on climatic considerations, and it was pointed out that, while there is 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. 419 

clear evidence of a considerable change in climatic conditions since the period 
when Glossopteris flourished on the Antarctic continent, there is no adequate 
reason to assume any change in the position of the earth's axis. Meagre as it 
is, the material collected by the Polar party calls up a picture of an Antarctic 
land on which it is reasonable to believe were evolved the elements of a new 
flora that spread in diverging lines over a' Palpeoznic continent, the disju-ncta 
membra of which have long been added to other land-masses, where are preserved 
both the relics of tlie southern flora and of that which had its birth in the north. 
The President (Prof. W. Ratkson) then declared the discussion closed. 



4. Heredity of some Eiiiolional Trails. 
By Professor C. B. Davenport. 

While sociologists, who lay great stress on the importance of conditions in 
determining human traits, have been forced to admit the hereditary basis of 
feeble-mindedness, they still hold, for the most part, to the view that in the 
moral field heredity plays little part. Both to test this view and because 
of the theoretical importance of the subject, the topic of inheritance of the 
traits of persons of the criminalistic type was undertaken. 

The base of the study is the family history of 165 wayward girls in State 
institutions of the United States. The family histories were secured by 
specially trained 'field-workers,' operating in conjunction with State Iii.stitu- 
tions and the Eugenics Record Oftice. In addition, for the study of special 
topics a mass of other family histories, some 2,500 in number, was drawn upon 
freely. 

As a general result of these studies about twenty traits were considered in 
some detail. Many did not yield any clear-cut results; but in at least five 
cases the hereditary factor was clear and evidently determined the behaviour. 

1. The tendency to tantrums — or violent outbursts of temper — in adults is 
inherited as a dominant trait ; that is, it does not skip generations. In several 
scores of histories it was possible to trace the tendency back three, four, and 
even five generations. 

2. Violent eroticism, or striking lack of self-control in the sex .sphere, is 
also a positive character, and likewise is traced back without breaking genei'u- 
tions; and half of the offspring of a highly erotic person show similar irresistible 
impulses. 

3. Impulsions to suicide are accompanied by depressions. In harmony with 
what has been shown for some types of mania-depression insanity, it appears 
that this depression is inherited as a recessive or negative character. It 
ordinarily skips generations; but the tendency is ordinarily found on both sides 
of the parentage of the affected individual. 

4. 5. Two other traits appear, remarkably enough, as sex-linked characters. 
They are transmitted through mothers to some or all of their sons. They 
appear in daughters, typically, only when shown by the father, and the tendency 
is carried also by the mother. If both parents show the trait all children have 
the tendency to develop, in due time, the trait. These traits are dipsomania 
and ceitain other types of irresistible impulsions to drink, and nomadism, or 
the impulsion to wander. 



5. The Hormone Theory of the Heredity of Somalic Modificnlions. 
By Dr. J. T. Cunningham, M.A. 

Darwin's theory of the origin of species was founded on the assumption that 
species were divided by differences of adaptation. It may be true that allied 
species sometimes differ slightly in their mode of life, and show differences 
of structure corre.sponding to these differences of action ; but investigation has 
entirely failed to prove any utility or bionomical significance for many specific 
and other diagnostic characters, and the assumption that such characters are 
due to correlation with adaptive characters is without foundation. 

Mendelism in itself throws no direct light on the origin of characters; it 
deals merely with their transmission. It is inferred, however, by the 

E E 2 



420 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. 

Mendelians that characters transmitted as units must have arisen as units, and 
it is certain that Mendelism has shown how loss of characters and new com- 
binations produce new varieties or types. It is reasonable to conclude from 
jiresent knowledge that non-usefiil diagnostic characters have arisen as the 
result of gametogenesis and conjugation; but the principles of Mendelism or 
mutation are not applicable to the phenomena of adaptation. 

In tlie first place when we see, as in the frog, the flat-fish, or the caterpillar, 
adaptation to two quite different sets of conditions in the individual life, it is 
impossible to believe that such transformation was due to mutations not caused 
by the external conditions. There is no evidence that the necessary gradual 
changes could occur unless the conditions produced them ; if so, why have they 
not occurred in other cases when the conditions were absent. 

In the second place we have the phenomena of secondary sexual characters, 
of which one of the most impressive and most fully investigated is that of the 
antlers of stags. The Mendelian merely regards such characters as mutations 
which are coupled with primary sex. But primary sex is determined at 
fertilisation, and such secondary sex characters have been shown to be dependent 
on the presence and function of the gonads. Characters which are determined 
in the gametes are not generally affected by computations of gonads at any 
part of the body in after life. It has been shown that the effects of castration 
on the development of secondary sexual characters are due to the stimulus of 
chemical substances produced by the gonads, especially in their functional 
activity. 

No hypothesis explains the^e facts except the Lamarckian, namely, that the 
stimuli involved in the use of the organ originally produced them by causing 
hypertrophy in the part of the soma affected, and that in course of generation 
the tendency to this hypertrophy was transmitted to the gametes. The hormone 
theory explain.^ how such transmission luay be effected. The hypertrophied part 
gives off chemical substances or hormones which circulate through the body, 
and acting on the gametes stimulate those parts of them which are destined to 
develop the same parts in the next generation. The transmitted effect may be 
infinitesimal at first, but if continued for many generations would account for 
the phenomena we now observe. 

This, of course, would account for the transmission of all somatic modifica- 
tions due to external stimuli, and a special application of the theory is needed 
to explain the peculiarities of functional secondary sexual characters. 

lu the first place the stimuli in these cases have acted only on individuals of 
one sex, on the males in stags, on the females in the case of the mammary 
glands. On any other theory a variation occurring in one sex would be inherited 
by both sexes unless it was coupled with primary sex, and then it would be 
wanting in the other sex. But antlers are not wanting in females nor mammary 
glands in males : they are only not developed. On the hormone theory the 
somatic modifications were produced at the time when the gonads were giving 
off theia- hormones, and thus the tendency which is inherited is to develop these 
modifications in the presence of those hormones and not otherwise. Then we 
can understand why the organs develop only at puberty, and often only develop 
during the period of sexual activitj-, being shed or absorbed at the end of that 
period and re-developed. 

6. Some Facts regarding the Anatomji of fhc Genus Pegasus. 
By Professor Hector P. E. Jungkrsen. 

The facts, briefly condensed in the following abstract, have — for the greater 
part — hitherto been overlooked or unknown. 

Cranutl Skeleton. — Opisthotics, alisphenoids, orbitosphenoids, and basi- 
sphenoid absent ; no eye-muscle canal. Posttemporal (suprascapular) forms part 
of the skull. Three stout infraoi'bitals, the middle and posterior firmly con- 
nected with the preopercle. Opercular apparatus complete. The large flat 
preopercle, covering most of the lower face of the head, has generally been 
taken as ' homologous to operculum, prseoperculum, and suboperculum ' 
(fliinther), while the very small operele and subopercle, hidden in thick skin, 
have completely escaped attention. Interoperculum slender, widely separated 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. 421 

from subopercle, only its anterior end visible from without. The prominent 
rostrum (much shortened in females of P. draconis and P. volans) is formed by 
the coalesced nasals. Pterygo-palatine bar very shortened, consisting of the 
palatine and only one pterygoid (ento- and metapterygoid wanting), completely 
separated from hyomandibular suspensorium and connected with anterior end 
of vomer; together with premaxilla and maxilla lodged in a precranial cavity 
below the base of the rostrum. Between premaxilla and maxilla is interpolated 
a large separate bone, corresponding to a small cartilaginous disc or meniscus 
found in other fishes. Front part of maxilla forming a large process projecting 
over premaxilla into anterior part of the subrostral chamber. Mandibular 
suspensorium consisting only of hyomandibular, symplectic and quadrate. — 
Branchiostegals 5, well developed (hitherto only one observed and described as 
rudimentary). Basibranchials 2; lower and upper pharyngeals with conical 
teeth. Hypobranchials I. -III. present; epibranchial IV. very long and stout, 
widely separated from its ceratobranchial. Pharyngobranchials II. and III. 
fused into a well-developed dentiferous plate; pharyngobranchials I. and IV. 
absent. 

Clavicular arch consisting only of post temporal and clavicle ; part of the 
latter enters the dermal skeleton of the trunk. Scapular arch and pectoral fin 
almost horizontal, their inner faces looking upwards. Foramen scapulare 
bounded by both scapula and coracoid ; the latter with processes fastened to the 
ventral carapace. Articular face for pectoral rays fixed across a slit in the 
carapace and made up of jjart of the scapula and three stout basals. 

Pectoral rays unbranched, but fundamentally like soft rays ; they are jointed 
distally, stiff basally, and composed of two longitudinal parts ; but owing to the 
horizontal position of the fin the otherwise lateral constituents in Pegasus are 
upper and lower, and instead of being equal halves, the upper is much more 
slender than the lower. In the so-called pectoral spines of P. draconis and P. 
■volans the upper constituent is almost thread-like, imbedded in a furrow along 
the lower one, which may be extremely stout (c/. especially the 5th pectoral ray 
of P. volans) ; the original jointed condition is much obscured but always obser- 
vable, and the extreme apex is always soft and distinctly jointed. 

Pelvis large (to a certain degree resembling that of Sebastes), by means of 
short ligaments fastened to the clavicles. First ray of ventral fin a, well- 
develojjed, true spinous ray (hitherto completely overlooked) ; one or two 
elongated, unbranched soft rays and a slender short one {Pegasus draconis, P. 
volans, P. nutans : I-t-2, /-•. lancifer I-f3). — Abdominal vertcOrce 7; the anterior 
G immovably joined, devoid of ribs, provided with large spinous processes 
forming together a long partition, the upper margin of which (from vertebra 
2 to C) carries a modified interneural, probably reiJrescnting an aborted first 
dorsal fin. 7tli vertebra movable, provided like the 8th (the first caudal) witli 
strong ribs (probably ' epipleurals ' rather than true ribs). Number of caudal 
vertebra3 : P. draconis 12, P. volans 1-3, P. nutans 15.' Vertebras 8-12 con- 
nected with 5 dorsal and 5 anal interspinous bones, all bisegmented ; first 
and interspinous bone considerably enlarged. Last caudal vertebra terminat- 
ing as a vertical plate (probably the urostyle fused with 2 hypurals), 8 caudal. 
5 anal, and 5 dorsal soft, unbranched rays. 

The main longitudinal jnusclcs of the trunk have been modified under the 
influence of the "immovable carapace. The dorsal and ventral portions are 
separated on each side by a considerable interspace, the lateral body wall con- 
sisting only of the dermal armour and its peritoneal lining ; besides the anterior, 
part of the dorsal portion is mainly reduced to a flat thin ligament. In the 
posterior part of the trunk and in the movable tail the longitudinal muscles are 
well developed, with strong tendons inserted to the dermal skeleton as well as 
to the vertebra.— &amp;'/'/s four, each a double row of leaves. Pseudobranchia large, 
with 6-7 leaves.— 6'(7;-?-a/ters small, papilliform; a slit in front of lower 
\A\a.xyi\^ea\.— Air-bladder absent. The greater part of the contents of the body 
cavity lodged in front of pelvis. A large left and a small right lobe of the 
liver are connected by a narrow bridge below the alimentary canal; most of the 
lobes situated dorsally to the latter. The wide o.sophagus passes into the quite 
straight and simple sloinuch, which again without any demarcation continues 

' /'. lanci/er I have not had the opportunity to dissect. 



422 TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION D. * 

in the intestine, the beginning of the latter only indicated by the entrance of the 
bile-duct. A gall-bladder on the lower face of the right liver-lobe. Behind the 
entrance of the bile-duct the intestine turns to the left side ; after two convo- 
lutions below the left liver-lobe it runs transversely under the liver-bridge to 
the right side, and after two narrow convolutions it reaches the middle line and 
as the colon passes over the pelvis to the anus. — The kidneys are remarkably 
short, reaching from the skull over only one-third of the body cavity ; urinary 
ducts long, urinary vesicle large, bilobed. Ovaries closed sacs behind the 
kidneys, ociducts short and wide. Testes short and narrow. The caudal vein 
divides into two large veins passing along the urinary ducts into the kidneys. 
The aorta follows in the trunk the right side of the vertebrae, giving off the 
arteria coeliaca far in front, just behind the union of the branchial arterise 
revehentes. 

The facts mentioned above clearly show the Peyasus (1) to be an 
Acanthopterygian, (2) to represent at least a ' suborder ' of its own, distin- 
guished by several structural peculiarities from all fishes hitherto known (see, 
for example, the quite unique precranial position of the pterygo-palatine bar 
together with the preniaxilla and maxilla, the connection of the latter bones by 
means of an interpolated bone, &amp;c.). Possibly the Pvijugida' [Hypostomides) 
may be a strongly modified offshoot from the stem of the Scleroparei ; but no 
existing mail-cheeked fish shows any closer relatioii.ship with the Pvgasidce, 
certainly not forms like Aj/onus or AspidopJioroidcs. 



7. Acquired Habits of Muscidce [Shecp-Mayyol-Ftics). 
By Walter W. Froogatt, F.L.S. 

At the present time the most serious enemies of the land-owners and 
squatters in the greater part of pastoral Australia are several species of blow- 
flies. Forsaking their natural food, chiefly carrion, they have acquired the 
habit of blowing any soiled or damp wool on otherwise healthy sheep. 

All the iiies in question, though well-known indigenous species common to 
the greater part of Australia, only learnt the value of soiled wool as a suitable 
place to deposit their eggs, or living maggots, within the last ten or twelve years. 

Previously they were known merely as ' blow-flies.' Several kinds came into 
the house and dropped their eggs upon meat, or at times infested open wounds ; 
but otherwise they were simijly scavengers. Others were found about decaying 
animal matter in the vicinity of killing yards or butchers' shops, a few feasted 
upon rotten fruit and such like fermenting vegetable matter. At the present 
time (1914) at least four species have been bred in, and identified from, soiled 
wool taken from sheep ruiniing in the paddocks under exactly the same con- 
ditions that have prevailed in sheep breeding in Australia for the last twenty- 
five years. 

Though this wool-blov\'ing habit was unknown in this country until about 
twelve years ago, it is remarkable that in Great Britain, from a very early date 
in the records of sheep husbandry, two species of ' blue-bottles ' or ' blow-flies ' 
have been known to do a certain amount of damage in exactly the same manner 
to the shepherd's flocks. Though cosmopolitan in its range, Liicilia sericata, 
the common sheep-fly of Great Britain, has never been recorded as having affected 
healthy sheep in any other part of the world, except in one isolated case, when it 
was accidentally introduced with sheep into Holland. Prior to 1903 there may 
have been occasional cases of blown wool, under exceptional circumstances, as 
has been claimed by sheep-owners, when discussing the question of sheep- 
maggot-flies, but it was certainly a comparatively rare occurrence to find putrid 
blown wool. About the end of 1902 the writer first obtained samples of shorn 
wool containing living maggots; and in the follov^'ing season they were reported 
doing considerable damage. Specimens were received for identification from 
the owners of flocks in the north, north-west, and from a large area of the 
southern plains. 

At first the point of infestation was round the tail where the wool had been 
soiled with the urine, and the injury was chiefly confined to close-woolled stud 
ewes. Within a very short time, however, the flies found that other kmds of 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. 423 

damp wool were suitable, and though the sheep with the thickest fleeces and 
wririlded skins are the most susceptible, no class or breed of sheep is exempt in 
a bad tly year. Ewes, too, were the first that suffered, but it was soon evident 
that both sexes were liable to infestation if weather conditiorus were favourable 
and flies abundant. Wethers are blown anywhere if dirty or damp, and lambs 
after tailing and marking are often so badly blown that a certain percentage die 
despite the greatest care; while on the large holdings in Central Queensland, 
where the system of marking is more rough and ready, thousands of lambs, 
particularly wether lambs, are blown, and in some cases might be said to be 
eaten alive. Eams, though they often get ' maggoty heads ' from the after-results 
of fighting, were the last to be attacked on the body wool. But it is now quite 
a common thing to find a number of stud rams badly blown about the crutch, 
and the maggots swarming on the wool of the rump. 

Where sheep are not examined constantly, and get even slightly blown, the 
infested area soon spreads, as other flies, attracted by the scent, keep on blowing 
round the evil- smelling heated wool. As these maggots increase in size they work 
their way down through the fibre of the wool, and, through their presence, cause 
the wool to become a blackened putrid mass of corruption. Finally the maggots 
reach the skin, where they set up an inflammation of the cuticle. The broken 
skin suppurates and the detached wool is torn off, or falls oft'. Under such 
conditions the sheep often wanders away from the flock into the scrub, and 
dies ; the more robust ones recover. 

In all the first samples of blown wool, whether received from the sheep- 
owners or taken direct from sheep in the paddocks, the writer only bred one 
species of blow-fly. This was the common brown and yellow blow-fly {Calliphora 
villosa), found both in the town and country, a carrion-feeder ranging all over 
Australia. An unusual increase in the numbers of this species was probably 
due to several causes ; in the first instance to the enormous number of dead 
animals, particularly sheep, that had died during the great drought a few years 
before, and which, not worth skinning, usually remained covered with decaying 
skin and wool. This was also the time when hundreds of thousands of poisoned 
rabbits were festering all over the pastoral holdings — ideal carrion for the blow- 
flies. The next factor was the production of a new class of merino sheep, to 
replace the smaller smooth-bodied animals, quite a dift'erent type of larger size, 
closer wool, wrinkled skin, and heavy yoke all through the fine wool, much 
more easily soiled with urine and excreta. 

With the return of the good seasons the supply of carrion vanished, but the 
blow-flies remained. Some had blown the dead wool, and recognised the smell 
of fouled wool, and thus Calliphora villosa became a sheep-maggot-fly. Within 
the year numbers of a second species of blow-fly emerged from samples of 
infested wool which had been sent in from the country, and placed in the 
breeding jars. Though the maggots were very similar, it was a very distinct 
species, C'allipJioia ocea)iice, easily distinguished from the first species by its 
smaller size, and the colouration of the abdominal segments, which, instead of 
being golden, have the sides blotched with yellow, and the rest deep metallic 
blue. The range and habits of both species are identical, and as they are 
frequently found together it is only reasonable to suppose that Calliphora 
Oceania learnt the habit of blowing wool from Calliphora villosa. 

For several years only these two species were found in the larval state among 
blown wool. Though there were reports from sheep-owners that a third species 
was infesting the sheep, and that a dark-coloured ' hairy ' maggot was busy 
among the wool in the western country, it was not until late in 1909 that speci- 
mens of the third blow-fly, Calliphora rufifacies, was obtained direct from blown 
wool. There was no mistaking this smaller metallic blue and green fly : the 
parent of the ' hairy maggot.' While both the previous species produce the 
typical elongate cylindrical maggot, Calliphora rufifacies is a shorter thickened 
larva having each segment ringed with a band of fleshy filaments, which have 
given it the popular name in the bush of the ' hairy maggot ' or ' hairy maggot- 
fly.' Though now extending its range, until very lately this fly was not found 
in the coastal districts, but was confined to the inland districts of Australia. 

Before Calliphora rufifacies learnt the habit of blowing live wool, presumably 
through the smell of the wool infected by the other two species, it was a carrion- 



424 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. 

feeder in tlie larval state. Now its carrion-breeding habits have made it the 
most serious pest among all the blow-flies, for at the time when the wool on the 
sheep is too hot to breed maggots (in midsummer), and the other species are 
seldom seen, Galliphora rafrfacics is laying her eggs on dead sheep and any offal 
found roimd the tanks and dams, and is thus alwaj's on the increase. At the 
present time (1914) this species seems to have taken the place of the two common 
house species, and to be responsible for the greater part of the damage, all over 
the interior, caused by the sheep-maggot-flies. 

The last species to attack our sheep, and that only within the last two years, 
is the introduced British sheep-fly {Lucilia sericata), a series that is the 
common ' green-bottle-fly ' about the coastal country. In this case we have the 
descendants of the introduced British sheep-fly after having lost the peculiar 
habit of its ancestors, again acquiring the taste from the habit of allied 
Australian blow-flies. 

8. Auslralian Trenialodes and Cestodes : a Preliminary Study in 
Zoogeograhij. By S. J. Johnston, B.A., D.Sc. 

Practically all the groups of vertebrate animals found living in the various 
zoogeographical regions of the earth harbour numbers of parasitic worms. The 
entozoan fauna of one of these classes of vertebrate host in any particular 
region is constituted by a number of species which are found to be related to 
others which comprise the entozoan fauna of the scmie class of vertebrate host 
living in some other region. For instance, the entozoan fauna of marsupials in 
Australia comprises a number of Cestodes {e.g., species of Linstowia) and a 
number of Treniatodes {e.g., species of Harviostomuiii) , and the nearest relatives 
of each of these are found in certain species of Linstowia and Harmostomum 
that live parasitic in South American marsu])ials. 

The Trematodes and Cestodes of Australian birds find their nearest relatives 
in worms living in related birds that inhabit other parts of the world ; and the 
Trematodes and Cestodes of Australian frogs are most closely related to those of 
frogs in other regions. 

The entozoan fauna of tlie host-animals belonging to any particular class of 
vertebrate may be separated into two divisions : — (1) Those that have been 
parasitic in these hosts for a very long time — practically from the first appear- 
ance of the host-animals, and (2) those that represent more recent accjuirements. 
The members of the former division may be readily recognised by the fact that 
they have near relatives parasitic in other branches of the same stock, whilst 
members of the latter division generally have not. The members of each genus 
(or sometimes of several closely related genera) in tlie former division, in many 
cases scattered all over the world, constitute a natural group, and must be 
looked upon as derived from common ancestors. 

These ancestors were parasites of the progenitors of the host-animals in the 
very early days, when the group was much younger and much more restricted in 
its distribution than at tlie present time. A study of the relationships and 
distribution of the parasites affords some circumstantial evidence of the past 
movements and paths of dispersal of the host-animals. 



9. On. the Emergence of the Nymph of Anax papuensis (Burm) from 
the Egg (Glass Insecta, Order Odonata). By E. J. Tillyard, 
M.A.,' F.E.S. 

Previous to hatching, the embryo lies with its head fitting closely under the 
pedicel or cap of the egg. The eyes are large and blackish, the anteniue lying 
between them and directed posteriorly. The clypeus, labruni, mandibles, and 
maxilla; can be clearly seen. The labium appears as a large paired organ directed 
posteriorly, and reaching well down between the legs. The legs lie directed 
posteriorly along the outer (ventral) surface of the embryo, except the hind tarsi, 
which are directed forwards. The hind end of the abdomen is bent round the 
posterior end of the egg, the ninth and tenth segments, with the cerci, being 
directed forwards. The mid-gut still encloses a large cylinder of yolk. The 
tracheal system can be seen, but is devoid of air. 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. 425 

Dui-ing the three days previous to hatching, the dorsal vessel increases its 
pulse from about thirty to the minute to between eighty and one hundred. Just 
before hatching, a cephalic heart appears in the posterior head region. At first 
small and only pulsating intermittently, it rapidly increases iu size. The 
|)ressure thus caused forces the pedicel to break away from the egg, whereupon 
the nymph flows easily and quickly out of the egg-shell. It emerges swathed 
in an outer skin or sheath, which has been called by Pierre the ' amniotic cover- 
ing.' This is shown to be a non-cellular chitinous cuticle, not related to the 
amnion in any way. It represents, in fact, the first moult of the larva. The 
swathed stage may be termed the pro-nympli. 

The pro-nymph stage lasts only a few seconds. The cephalic heart increases 
enormously, and is seen to consist of two large chambers, an auricle and a 
ventricle, which pulsate regularly at about thirty beats to the minute, and 
appears to be pumping liquid, probably blood, into the head. The latter swells 
quickly up to twice its original size, and thus the pro-nymphal sheath soon splits 
down the back of the head and thorax, and the young nymph emerges, freeing 
itself from the sheath by a few convulsive struggles. 

The pro-nymphal sheath is seen to be made of very thin transparent ohitin, 
and shows the complete larval form, with head, mouth-parts, and legs easily 
seen. It ends posteriorly in a sharp spine, which catches in the broken end of 
the egg, and so forms an anchor during the emergence of the nymph. 

The cephalic heart quickly subsides in the free nymph. Meanwhile, a smaller 
pulsating chamber has appeared between the rectal valves. While the cephalic 
heart is forcing the blood into the head, this rectal pulsating organ appears to be 
pumping water into the rectum. As soon as the nymph is free, its pulsations 
increase to about eighty per minute, and water is violently forced into the 
rectum, so that the whole beautiful branchial basket is quickly distended and 
brought into view. Meanwhile, the tracheal system, which, at the time of 
hatching, only contained air anteriorly to the mid-gut, is seen to be steadily filling 
with air. The air travels slowly down the dorsal tracheal trunks and gradually 
fills the numerous branches, finally entering all the tiny tracheoles of the rectal 
gills. Afterwards, rectal breathing proceeds regularly. 

The young nymph is transparent except for the eyes and the dark plug of 
the mid-gut. It has two sharply pointed cerci, but the superior appendage is 
only rudimentary. In a few hours the nymph darkens all over to dull green or 
blackish. It is suggested that the rupture and atrophy of the amnion described 
by Brandt in the embryology of Odonata is due to the formation of the pro- 
nymphal sheath or cuticle, which forms a close-fitting and far more effective 
indtuctioii for the embryo, besides allowing for the early beginning of the process 
of excretion through the formation of a chitinous oxoskeleton.

The President delivered the following Address tit Adelaide on Wednesday, 
August 13 :^ 

Man as a Geofjraphkal Aijenci/. 

In an inaugural address to the Royal Scottish Geographical Society on Geography 
and Statecraft Lord Milner said : ' If I have no right to call myself a 
geographer, I am at least a firm believer in the value of geographical studies.' 
I wish to echo these words, I have no expert geographical knowledge, and am 
wholly unversed in science, but I am emboldened to try and say a few words 
because of my profound belief in the value of geographical studies. I believe in 
their value partly on general grounds, and largely because a study of the British 
Empire leads an Englishman, whether born in England or in Australia, to the 
inevitable conclusion that statecraft in the past would have been better, if there 
had been more accurate knowledge of geography. This statement might be 
illustrated by various anecdotes, some true, not a few apocryphal; but anecdotes 
do not lend themselves to the advancement of science. I am encouraged, too, 
to sjaeak because the field of geography is more open to the man in the street 
than are the sciences more strictly so-called. It is a graphy, not a logy. 
(ieology is the science of the earth. Geography is a description of the face of 
the earth and of what is on or under it, a series of pictures with appropriate 
letterpress and with more or less appropriate morals to adorn the tale. 

Taking the earth as it is, geographical discovery has well-nigh reached its 
limit. The truth, in the words of Addison's hymn, is now ' spread from Pole 
to Pole,' and recent exploration at the South Pole, with its tale of heroism, will 
have specially appealed to the citizens of this Southern land, reminding us all 
that the age of chivalry is not yet past. The city of Adelaide is rich in the 
record of explorers, and to the list is now added the name of Sir Douglas 
Mawson. It is not for me to attempt to take measure of his great enterprise, 
but the scientific results of his work, including the carrying of wireless tele- 
graphy into the Antarctic Continent, illustrate my thesis that man is a 
geographical agency. Members of the British Association will note with 
pleasure that he derived backing and inspiration from the Australasian Asso- 
ciation for the Advancement of Science. Outside the polar regions coasts are in 
most cases accurately known. The age of Cook and Flinders is past. Interiors 
are more or less known. In Africa there is no more room for Livingstones, 
Spekes, Burtons, Stanleys. In Australia Sir John Forrest is an honoured sm-vival 
of the exploring age — the age of McDouall Stuart and other heroes of Austra- 
lian discovery. The old map-makers, in Swift's well-known lines, ' o'er unhabit- 
able downs placed elephants for want of towns.' Towns have now taken the 
place of elephants and of kangaroos. Much, no doubt, still remains to be done. 
The known will be made far better known ; maps will be rectified ; many great 
inland tracts in Australia and elsewhere will be, as they are now being, 
scientifically surveyed ; corners of the earth only penetrated now will be swept 
and garnished. But as we stand to-day, broadly speaking, there are few more 
lands and seas to conquer. Discovery pure and simple is passing away. 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 427 

But meanwhile there is one side of geography which is coming more and 
more to the front, bringing it more than ever within the scope of the British 
Association for the Advancement of Science. ' Man is the ultimate term in the 
geographical problem,' said Dr. Scott Keltie some years since at the meeting at 
Toronto. ' Geography is a description of the earth as it is, in relation to man,' 
said Sir Clements Markham, long President of the Royal Geogi'aphical Society. 
Geography, I venture to think. Is becoming more and more a description of the 
earth as it is and as it will be under the working hand of man. It is becoming 
intensive rather than extensive. Geographers have to record, and will more 
and more have to record, how far man has changed and is changing the face of 
the earth, to try to predict how far he will change it in the coming centuries. 
The face'of the earth has been unveiled by man. Will the earth save her face 
in the years before us, and, if she saves her face, will it be taken at face value? 
How far, for instance, will lines of latitude and longitude continue to have any 
practical meaning? 

Man includes the ordinary man, the settler, the agriculturist; man includes, 
too, the extraordinary — the scientific man, the inventor, the engineer. 'Man,' 
savs a writer on the subject, 'is truly a geographical agency,' and I ask you to 
take account of this agency for a few minutes. I do so more especially because 
one of the chief features of the present day is the rise of the South; and the 
rise of the South— notably of Australia— is the direct result of human agency, 
on the one hand transforming the surface of the land, on the other eliminating 
distance. The old name of Australia, as we all know, was New Holland. The 
name was well chosen in view of later history, for while no two parts of the 
world could be more unlike one another than the little corner of Europe known 
us Holland, or the Netherlands, and the great Southern Continent, in the one 
and in the other man has been pre-eminently a geographical agency. 

The writer who used this phrase, ' Man is a geographical agency,' the 
American writer, Mr. G. P. Marsh, published Ills book, 'Man and Nature,' in 
1864, and a new edition, entitled ' The Earth as Modified by Human Action,' in 
1874. He was mainly concerned with the destructiveness of man in the 
geographical and clima'tic changes which he has effected. 'Every plant, every 
animal,' he writes, ' is a geographical agency, man a destructive, vegetables, 
and in some cases even wild beasts, restorative powers ' ; and again : ' It is in 
general true that tlie intervention of man has hitherto seemed to ensure the final 
exhaustion, ruin, and desolation of every province of Nature which he has 
reduced to his dominion.' The more civilised man has become, he tells us, tlie 
more he has destroyed. ' Purely untutored humanity interferes comparatively 
little with the arrangements of Nature, and the destructive agency of man 
becomes more and more energetic and unsparing as he advances in civilisation.' 
In short, in his opinion, ' better fifty years of Cathay than a cycle of Europe.' 
He took this gloomy view mainly on account of the mischief done by 
cutting down forests. Man has wrought this destruction not only with his own 
hand, but through domesticated animals more destructive than wild beasts, 
sheep, goats, horned cattle, stunting or killing the young shoots of trees. Writ- 
ing of Tunisia, Mr. Perkins, the late able Principal of Roseworthy College, says : 
' In so far as young trees and shrubs are concerned, the passage of a flock of 
goats will do quite as much damage as a bush fire.' Mr. Marsh seems to have 
met a fool in the forest, and it was man; and he found him to be more knave 
than fool, for man has been, in Mr. Marsh's view, the revolutionary Radical 
confiscating Nature's vested interests. ' Man,' he says, ' has too long forgotten 
that the earth was given to him for usufruct alone, not for consumption, still 
less for profligate waste.' Trees, to his mind, are Conservatives of the best kind. 
They stand in the way, it is true, but they stop excesses, they moderate the 
climate, they give shelter against the Avind, they store the water, prevent inun- 
dations, preserve and enrich the soil. ' The clearing of the woods,' he says, ' has 
in some cases produced within two or three generations effects as blasting as 
those generally ascribed to geological convulsions, and has laid waste the face 
of the earth more hopelessly than if it had been buried by a current of lava 
or a shower of volcanic sand ' ; and, once more, where forests have been 
destroyed, he says, 'The face of the earth is no longer a sponge but a dust- 
heap.' 

The damage done by cutting down trees, and thereby letting loose torrents

hich wash away the soil, is or was very marked in the South of France, in 
Dauphine, Provence, and the French Alps. With the felling of trees and the 
pasturing of sheep on the upper edge of the forest — for sheep break the soil and 
expose the roots — the higher ground has been laid bare. Rainstorms have in 
consequence swept off the soil, and the floods have devastated the valleys. 
The mountain-sides have become deserts, and the valleys have been turned into 
swamps. ' When they destroyed the forest,' wrote the great French geographer, 
Reclus, about thirty years ago, ' they also destroyed the very ground on which 
it stood ' ; and then he continues : ' The devastating action of the streams in the 
French Alps is a very curious iDhenomenon in the historical point of view, for it 
explains why so many of the districts of Syria, Greece, Asia Minor, Africa, and 
Spain have been forsaken by their inhabitants. The men have disappeared 
along with the trees; the axe of the woodman, no less than the sword of the 
conqueror, have put an end to, or transplanted, entire populations.' In the 
latter part of the South African war Sir William Willcocks, skilled in irrigation 
in Egypt, and subsequently reclaiming Mesopotamia, was brought to South Africa 
to report upon the possibilities of irrigation there, and in his report dated Novem- 
ber 1901 he wrote as follows : ' Seeing in Basutoland the effect of about thirty 
years of cultivation and more or less intense habitation convinced me of the 
fact that another country with steep slopes and thin depth of soil, like Pales- 
tine, has been almost completely denuded by hundreds of years of cultivation 
and intense habits. The Palestine which Joshua conquered and which the 
children of Israel inhabited was in all probability covered over great part of 
its area by sufficient earth to provide food for a population a hundred times as 
dense as that which can be supported to-day.' The Scotch geologist, Hugh 
Miller, again, attributed the formation of the Scotch mosses to the cutting down 
of timber by Roman soldiers. ' What had been an overturned forest became 
in the course of years a deep morass.' 

In past times there have been voices raised in favour of the forests, but they 
have been voices crying in the desert which man has made. Here is one. The 
old chronicler Holinshed, who lived in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, noted the 
amount of timber cut down for house building and in order to increase the area 
for pasturage. ' Every small occasion in my time,' he writes, ' is enough to cut 
down a great wood ' ; and in another passage either he himself or one of his 
collaborators writes that he would wish to live to see four things reformed in 
England : ' The want of discipline in tlie Church, the covetous dealing of most 
of our merchants in the preferment of commodities of other countries and 
hindrance of their own, the .holding of fairs and markets upon the Sunday to 
be abolished and referred to the Wednesdays, and that every man in whatever 
part of the champaine soil enjoyeth forty acres of land and upwards after that 
rate, either by free deed, copyhold or fee farm, might plant one acre of wood or 
sow the same with oke mast, hazell, beach, and sufficient provision be made that 
it be cherished and kept.' 

]\Ir. Marsh seems to have thought that the Old World, and especially the 
countries which formed the old Roman Empire, had been ruined almost past 
redemption ; and for the beneficent action of man on Nature he looked across the 
seas. 'Australia and New Zealand,' he writes, 'are perhaps the countries from 
which we have a right to expect the fullest elucidation of these difficult and 
disputable problems. Here exist greater facilities and stronger motives for the 
careful study of the topics in question than have ever been found combined in 
any other theatre of European colonisation.' 

His book was first written half a century ago. He was a pessimist evidently, 
and pessimists exaggerate even more than optimists, for there is nothing more 
exhilarating and consoling to ourselves than to predict the worst possible con- 
sequences from our neighbours' folly. Further, though it may be true that man 
became more destructive as he became more civilised, it is also true that the 
destruction has been wrought directly rather by the unscientific than by the 
scientific man. If we have not grown less destructive since, at any rate we have 
shown signs of penitence, and science has come to our aid in the work of 
reparation. Governments and associations have turned their attention to protect- 
ing woodland and reafforesting tracts which have been laid bare. The Touring 
Club of France, for instance, I am told, have taken up the question of the damage 
done by destruction of trees by men and sheep in Haute Savoie, and they assist

reclamation by guidance and by grants. In England, under the auspices of 
Birmingham University and vmder tlie Presidency of Sir Oliver Lodge, the Mid- 
lands Reafforestation Association is planting the pit mounds and ash quarries 
of tlie Black Country with trees which will resist smoke and bad air, alders, 
willows, poplars; carrying out their work, a report says, under a combina- 
tion of difficulties not to be found in any other country. Artificial lakes and 
reservoirs again, sucli as I shall refer to presently, are being made woodland 
centres. In most civilised countries nowadays living creatures are to some 
extent protected, tree planting is encouraged by Arbor days, and reserves are 
formed for forests, for beasts and birds, the survivors of the wild fauna of the 
earth. Some lands, such as Greece, as I gather from Mr. Perkins' report, are 
still being denuded of trees, but as a general rule the human conscience is 
becoming more and more alive to the immorality and the impolicy of wasting the 
surface of the earth and what lives upon it, and is even beginning to take stock 
as to whether the minerals beneath the surface are inexhaustible. Therefore I 
ask you now to consider man as the lord of creation in the nobler sense of the 
phrase, as transforming geography, but more as a creative than as a destructive 
agency. 

How far has the agency of man altered, how far is it likely to alter, 
the surface of the earth, the divisions and boundaries assigned by Nature, the 
climate, and the production of the different pai-ts of the globe; and, further, 
how far, when not actually transforming Nature, is hviman agency giving Nature 
the go-by? It should be borne in mind that science has effected, and is effect- 
ing transformation, partly by applying to old processes far more powerful 
machinery, partly by introducing new processes altogether; and that, as each 
new force is brought to light, lands and peoples are to a greater or less extent 
transformed. The w-orld was laid out afresh by coal and steam. A new 
readjustment is taking place with the development of water power and oil 
power. Lands with no coal, but with fine water power or access to oil, are 
asserting themselves. Oil fuel is prolonging continuous voyages and making 
coaling stations superfluous. But of necessity it is the earth herself who gives 
the machinery for altering her own surface. The application of the machinery 
is contributed by the wit of man. 

The surface of the earth consists of land and water. How far has human 
agency converted water into land or land into water, and how far, without 
actually transforming land into water and water into land, is it for practical 
human purposes altering the meaning of land and water as the great 
geographical divisions? A writer on the Fens of South Lincolnshire has told 
us : ' The Romans, not content with appropriating land all over the world, 
added to their territory at home by draining lakes and reclaiming marshes." 
We can instance another great race which, while appropriating land all over the 
world, has added to it by reclaiming land from water, fresh or salt. The 
traveller from Great Britain to the most distant of the great British possessions, 
New Zealand, will find on landing at Wellington a fine street, Lambton Quay, 
the foreshore of the old beach, seaward of which now rise many of the city's 
finest buildings on land reclaimed from the sea; and instances of the kind might 
be indefinitely multiplied. Now the amount of land taken from water by man 
has been taken more from fresh water than from sea, and, taken in all, the 
amount is infinitesimal as compared with the total area of land and water; but 
it has been very considerable in certain small areas of the earth's surface, and 
from these small areas have come races of men who have profoundly modified 
the geography and history of the world. This may be illustrated from the 
Netherlands and from Great Britain. 

Motley, at the beginning of ' The Dutch Republic,' writes of the Nether- 
lands : 'A region, outcast of ocean and earth, wrested at last from both domains 
their richest treasures.' Napoleon was credited with saying that the Nether- 
lands were a deposit of the Rhine, and the rightful property of him who con- 
trolled the sources; and an old writer pronounced that Holland was the gift of 
the ocean and of the rivers Rhine and Meuse, as Egypt is of the river Nile. 
The crowning vision of Goethe's Faust is that of a free people on a free soil, 
won from the sea and kept for human habitation by the daily effort of man. 
Such lias been the story of the Netherlands. The Netherlands, as a home for 
civilised men, were, and are, the result of reclamation, of dykes and polders. 



430 TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION E. 

The kingdom has a constantly changing area of between 12,000 and 13,000 
■ square miles. Mr. Marsh, in his book, set down the total amount gained to 
agricidture at the time he wrote ' by dyking out the sea and by draining shallow 
bays and lakes ' at some 1,370 square miles, which, he says, was one-tenth of the 
kingdom ; at the same time, he estimated that much more had been lost to the sea 
—something like 2,600 square miles. He writes that there were no important sea 
dykes before the thirteenth century, and that draining inland lakes did not 
begin till the fifteenth, when windmills came into use for pumping. In the 
nineteenth century steam pumps took the place of windmills, science strengthen- 
ing an already existing process. Between 1815 and 1855, 172 square miles were 
reclaimed, and this included the Lake of Haarlem, some thirteen miles long 
by six in breadth, with an area of about seventy-three square miles. This was 
reclaimed between 1840 and 1853. At the present time, we are told, about 
forty square miles are being reclaimed annually in Holland; and meanwhile 
the Dutch Government have in contemplation or in hand a great scheme for 
draining the Zuyder Zee, which amounts to recovering from the ocean land 
which was taken by it in historic times at the end of the fourteenth century. 
The scheme is to be carried out in thirty-three years and is to cost nearly sixteen 
million pounds. The reclamation is to be effected by an embankment across the 
mouth of this inland sea over eighteen miles long. The result will be to add 815 
square miles of land to the kingdom of the Netherlands, 750 square miles of 
which -will be fertile land, and in addition to create a much-needed freshwater 
lake with an area of 557 square miles; this lake is to be fed by one of the mouths 
of the Rhine. 

London is partly built on marsh. The part of London where I live, Pimlico, 
was largely built on piles. A little way north, in the centre of fashion, is 
Belgrave Square, and here a lady whom I used to know had heard her grand- 
father say that he had shot snipe. Take the City of London in the strict 
and narrow sense. The names of Moorfields and Fensbury or Finsbury are 
familiar to those who know the City. Stow, in his Survey of London, over 
three hundred years a»go, wrote of ' The Moorfield which lieth without the 
postern called Moorgate. This field of old time was called the Moor. This 
fen or moor field, stretching from the wall of the city betwixt Bishopsgate and 
the postern called Cripplegate to Fensbury and to Holywell continued a wa.ste 
and unprofitable ground a long time.' By 1527, he tells us, it was drained ' into 
the course of Walbrook, and so into the Thames, and by these degrees was 
this fen or moor at length made main and hard ground which before, being 
overgrown with flags, sedges and rushes, served to no use.' It is said that this 
fen or marsh had come into being since Roman times. The reclamation which 
has been carried out in the case of London is typical of what has been done in 
numerous other cases. As man has become more civilised, he has come down 
from his earlier home in the uplands, has drained the valley swamps, and on 
the firm land thus created has planted the streets and houses of great cities. 

The Romans had a hand in the draining of Romney Marsh in Sussex, and 
here Nature co-operated with man, just as she has co-operated in the deltas of 
the great rivers, for the present state of the old Cinque Ports, Rye and 
Winchelsea, shows how much on this section of the English coast the sea has 
receded. But the largest reclamation was in East Anglia, where the names of 
the Fens and the Isle of Ely testify to what the surface once was. ' For some 
of our fens,' writes Holinshed, ' are well known to be either of ten, twelve, 
sixteen, twenty or thirty miles in length. . . . Wherein also Elie, the famous 
isle, standeth, which is seven miles every way, and whereunto there is no access 
but by three causies.' Arthur Young, in 1799, in his 'General View of the 
Agriculture of the County of Lincoln,' a copy of which he dedicated to that 
great friend of Australia, Sir Joseph Banks, who was a Lincolnshire landowner 
and a keen supporter of reclamation, wrote of the draining which had been 
carried out in Lincolnshire. ' The quantity of land thus added to the kingdom 
has been great; fens of water, mud, wild fowl, frogs and agues have been 
converted to rich pasture and arable worth from 20s. to 40.s. an acre .... 
without going back to very remote periods, there cannot have been less than 
150,000 acres drained and improved on an average from 5s. an acre to 25s.' 
150,000 acres is about 234 square miles, but the amount reclaimed by draining 
in Lincolnshire in the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries seems 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 431 

to have been well over 500 square miles. The Fenlands as a whole extended 
into six counties. They were seventy miles in length, from ten to thirty miles 
broad, and covered an area of from 800 to 1,000 square miles. One estimate 
I have seen is as high as 1,200 square miles. Mr. Prothero, in his book on 
' English Farming, Past and Present,' tells us that they were ' in the seventeenth 
century a wilderness of bogs, pools and reed shoaLs — a vast morass from which 
here and there emerged a few islands of solid earth.' In the seventeenth cen- 
tury a Dutch engineer, Vermuyden, was called in to advise, and the result of 
draining what was called after the peer who contracted for it the Bedford 
Level, together with subsequent reclamations, was to convert into ploughland 
and pasture large tracts which, in the words of an old writer, Dugdale, had 
been ' a vast and deep fen, affording little benefit to the realm other than fish 
or fowl, with overmuch harbour to a rude and almost barbarous sort of lazy 
and beggarly people.' In Lincolnshire there was a district called Holland, and 
in Norfolk one called Marshland, said to have been drained by, to quote Dugdale 
again, 'those active and industrious people, the Romans.' 

The Dutch and the English, who thus added to their home lands by re- 
clamation, went far and wide through the world, changing its face as they 
went. The Dutch, where they planted themselves, planted trees also ; and when 
they came to land like their own Netherlands, again they reclaimed and em- 
poldered. The foreshore of British Guiana, with its canals and sea defences, 
dating from Dutch times, is now the chief sugar-producing area in the British 
West Indies. If again in Australia man has been a geographical agency, he 
learnt his trade when he was changing the face of his old home in the British 
Isles. 

Instances of reclaiming land from water might be indefinitely multiplied. 
We might compare the work done by different nations. In Norway, for 
instance, Eeclus wrote that ' the agriculturists are now reclaiming every year forty 
squai'e miles of the marshes and fiords.' Miss Semple, who, in the ' Influences 
of C4eographic Environment,' writes that ' between the Elbe and Scheldt ' (that 
is, including with the Netherlands some of North Germany) ' more than 2,000 
square miles have been reclaimed from river and sea in the past 300 years,' 
tells us also that ' the most gigantic dyke system in the world is that of the 
Hoangho, by which a territory of the size of England is won from the water 
for cultivation.' Or we might take the different objects which have impelled 
men here and there to dry up water and bank out sea. Agriculture has not 
been the only object, nor yet reclaiming for town sites. Thus, in order to 
work the hematite iron mines at Hodbarrow, in Cumberland, an area of 170 
acres was, in the years 1900-04, reclaimed from the sea by a barrier over 11 mile 
long, designed by the great firm of marine engineers, Coode and Matthews, 
who built the Colombo breakwater. The reclaimed land, owing to the subsi- 
dence caused by the workings, is now much below the level of the sea. Here is 
an instance of reclamation not adding to agricultural or pastoral area, but 
giving mineral wealth, thereby attracting population and enriching a district. 

How far has land been drowned by the agency of man? Again the total 
area is a negligible quantity, but again, relatively to small areas, it has been 
appreciable, and the indirect effects have been great. God made the country, 
man made the town; and the town is trying to unmake or to remake the 
country. The necessities of town life are responsible for new lakes and rivers. 
Such are the great reservoirs and aqueducts by which water is being brought 
to New York from the Catskill Moimtains, one of the reservoirs being twelve 
miles long with a water surface of nearly thirteen square miles. The whole 
work has been described by a writer in the Times as ' hardly second in 
magnitude and importance to the Panama Canal.' In Great Britain cities 
in search of a water supply have ordered houses, churches, fields to be 
drowned, and small lakes to come into existence. Liverpool created Lake Vyrnwy 
in Montgomeryshire, with a length of nearly five miles and an area of 1,121 acres. 
Birmingham is the parent of similar lakes in a wild Radnorshire valley near 
my old home. The water is not carried for anything like the distance from 
Mundaring to Kalgoorlie, and on a much greater scale than these little lakes 
in Wales is the reservoir now being formed in New South Wales by the 
Burrinjuck dam, on the Murrumbidgee River, which, as I read, is, or will be, 
forty-one miles long, and cover an area of twenty square miles. If I under-

•stand light, in this case, by constracting a giant dam over 200 feet high 
across a gorge through which the river flows, a long narrow lake has 
been or is being called into existence. A still larger volume of water is 
gathered by the great Assouan dam, which holds up the Nile at the head of 
the First (!a.taract, wasliing, and at times submerging, the old temples on the 
Island of I'hiliU in mid-stream. First completed in 1902, the dam was enlarged 
and heightened by 1912; and the result of the dam is at the time of high 
Nile to create a lake of some 65 square miles in area, as well as to fill up the 
channel of the river for many miles up stream. Illustrations of artificial lakes 
might be multiplied from irrigation works in India. An official report on the 
vState of Hyderabad, written some years ago, has the following reference to the 
tanks in the granitic country of that State : ' There are no natural lakes, but from 
the earliest times advantage has been taken of the undulating character of the 
country to dam up some low ground or gorge between two hills, above Avliich the 
drainage of a large area is collected. Such artifioial reservoirs are peculiar to the 
granitic country, and wherever groups of granite hills occur tanks are sure to be 
found associated with them.' Take again the great ship canals. The Suez Canal 
runs for 100 miles from sea to sea, though for part of its course it runs through 
water, not through sand. It is constantly growing in depth and width. Its 
original depth was 26^ feet; it is now, for nine-tenths of its length, over 
36 feet, and the canal is to be further deepened generally to over 39 feet. Its 
original width at the bottom was 72 feet ; it is now, for most of its course, 
over 147 feet ; in other words, the width has been more than doubled. A 
writer in the Times on the wonderful Panama Canal said : ' The locks and 
the Gatun dam have entailed a far larger displacement of the earth's surface 
than has ever been attempted by the liand of man in so limited a space. ' 
Outside the locks the depth is 45 feet, and the minimum bottom width 300 feet. 
The official liandbook of the Panama Canal says : ' It is a lake canal as well as 
a lock canal, its dominating feature being Gatun Lake, a great body of water 
covering about 164 square miles.' The canal is only fifty miles long from open sea 
to open sea, from shore line to shore line only forty. But, in making it, man, the 
geographical agency, has blocked tlie waters of a river, the Chagres river, by 
building up a ridge which connects the two lines of hills between which the 
river flows, this ridge being a dam 1^ miles long, nearly half a mile wide at 
its base, and rising to 105 feet above sea-level, with the result that a lake has 
come into existence which is three-quarters of the size of the Lake of Geneva, 
and extends beyond the limits of the Canal zone. When all the sluices are 
open, a great^er volume of water passes through them than comes over the Falls 
of Niagara. 

Mr. Marsh, in his book, referred to far more colossal schemes for turning 
land into water, such as flooding the African Sahara or cutting a canal from 
the Mediterranean to the Jordan and thus submerging the basin of the Dead 
Sea, which is below the level of the ocean. The effect of the latter scheme, he 
estimated, would be to add from 2,000 to 3,000 square milea to the fluid surface 
of Syria. All that can be said is that the wild-cat schemes of one century often 
become the domesticated possibilities of the next and the accomplished facts of 
the third ; that the more discovery of new lands passes out of sight the more 
men's energies and imagination will be concentrated upon developing and 
altering what is in their keeping ; and that, judging from the past, no un- 
scientific man can safely set any limit whatever to the future achievements 
of science. 

But now, given that the proportion of land to water and water to land has 
not been, and assuming that it will not be, appreciably altered, has water, for 
practical purposes, encroached on land, or land on water ? In many cases water 
transport has encroached on land transport. The gi-eat isthmus canals are an 
obvious instance ; so are the great Canadian canals. The tonnage passing 
through the locks of the Sault St. Marie is greater than that which is carried 
through the Suez Canal. Waterways are made where there was dry land, and 
more often existing inland waterways are converted into sea-going ways. 
Manchester has become a seaport through its Ship Canal. The Clyde, in Mr. 
Vernon Harcourt's words, written in 1895, has been ' converted from an insig- 
nificant stream into a deep navigable river capable of giving access to ocean- 
going vessels of large draught up to Glasgow.' In 1758 the Clyde at low water 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDUTOSS 433 

at Glasgow was only 15 inches deep, and till ]818 no seagoing vessels came 
up to Glasgow. In 1895 the depth at low water was from 17 to 20 feet, and 
steamers with a maximum draught of 252 ^^'^^ could go up to Glasgow. This 
was the result of dredging, deepening and widening the river, and increasing 
the tidal flow. The record of the Tyne has been similar. The effect of 
dredging the Tyne was that in 1895 — I quote Mr. Harcourt again — ' Between 
Shields and Newcastle, where formerly .steamers of only 3 to 4 feet draught 
used to ground for hours, there is now a depth of 20 feet throughout at the 
lowest tides.' It is because engineers have artificially improved Nature's work 
on the Clyde and the Tyne that these rivers have become homes of shipbuilding 
for the whole world. Building training walls on the Seine placed Rouen, 
seventy-eight miles up the river, liigh among the seaports of France. The Elbe 
and tlie Rhine, the giant rivers Mississippi and St. Lawrence, and many other 
rivers, ■have, as we all know, been wonderfully transformed by the hand of the 
engineer. 

But land in turn, in this matter of transport, has encroached upon sea. In 
old days, when roads were few and bad, when there were no railways, and 
when ships wei-e small, it was all-important to bring goods by water at all 
parts as far inland as possible. In England there were numerous flourishing 
little ports in all the estuaries and up the rivers, which, under modern condi- 
tions, have decayed. No one now thinks of Canterbury and Winchester in 
connection with seaborne traffic ; but Mr. Belloc, in ' The Old Road,' a description 
of the historical Pilgrims' Way from Winchester to Canterbury, jioints out 
how these two old-world cathedral cities took their origin and derived their 
importance from the fact that each of them, Canterbury in particular, w-as 
within easy reach of the coast, where a crossing from France would be made ; 
each on a rivei- — in the case of Canterbury on the Stour just above the end 
of the tideway. In the days when the Island of Thanet was really an island, 
separated from the rest of Kent by an arm of the sea, and when the present 
insignificant river Stour was, in the words of the historian J. R. Green, 'a wide 
and navigable estuary,' Canterbury was a focus to which the merchandise of six 
Kentish seaports was brought, to pass on inland ; it was in effect practically a 
seaport. Now merchandise, except purely local traffic, comes to a few large 
ports only, and is carried direct by rail to great distant inland centres. Reclus 
wrote that bays are constantly losing in comparative importance as the inland 
ways of rapid communication increase; that, in all countries intersected with 
railways, indentations in the coast-line have become rather an obstacle than an 
advantage; and that maritime commerce tends more and more to take for its 
starting-place ports situated at the end of a peninsula. He argues, in short, 
that traffic goes on land as far out to sea as possible instead of being brought by 
water as far inland as possible. He clearly overstated the case, hut my con- 
tention is that, for human purposes, the coast-line, though the same on the map, 
has practically been altered by human agency. By the aid of science ports have 
been brought to men as much as men to ports. We see before our eyes the 
process going on of bridging India to Ceylon so as to carry goods and passengers 
as far by land as possible, and in Ceylon we see the great natural harbour of 
Trincomalee practically deserted and a wonderful artificial harbour created at 
the centre of population, Colombo. 

But let us carry the argument a little further. Great Britain is an island. 
Unless there is some great convulsion of Nature, to all time the Straits of Dover 
will separate it from the continent of Europe. Yet we have at this moment 
a renewal of the scheme for a Channel tunnel, and at this moment men are 
flying from England to France and France to England. Suppose the Channel 
tvmnel to be made ; suppose flying to be improved — and it is improving every 
day — what will become of the island? What will become of the sea? They 
will be there and will be shown on the map, but to all human intents and 
purposes the geography will be changed. The sea will no longer be a barrier, 
it will no longer be the only high-road from England to France. There will be 
going to and fro on or in dry land, and going to and fro neither on land nor on 
sea. Suppose this science of aviation to make great strides, and heavy loads 
to be carried in the air, what will become of the ports, and what will become 
of sea-going peoples ? The ports will be there, appearing as now on the map, 
but Birmingham goods will be .shipped at Birmingham for foreign parts, and 

1914, ' ? ?

Litligow will export mineral direct, saying good-bye to the Blue Mountains and 
even to Sydney Harbour. 

Now, in saying this I may well be told by my scientific colleagues that it 
is all very well as a pretty piece of fooling, but that it is not business. I say 
it as an unscientific man with a profound belief in the unbounded possibilities of 
science. How long is it since it was an axiom that, as a lump of iron sinks in 
water, a ship made of iron could not possibly float? Is it fatuous to contem- 
plate that the conquest of the air, which is now beginning, will make it a highway 
for commercial purposes ? We have aeroplanes already which settle on the 
water and rise again ; we are following on the track of the gulls which we 
wonder at in the limitless waste of ocean. A century and a half ago the 
great Edmund Burke ridiculed the idea of representatives of the old North 
American colonies sitting in the Imperial Parliament ; he spoke of any such 
scheme as fighting with Nature and conquering the order of Providence ; he 
took the distance, the time -which -would be involved — six weeks from the 
present United States to London. If anyone had told him that what is happen- 
ing now through the applied forces of science might happen, he would have 
called his informant a madman. Men think in years, or at most in lifetimes ; 
they ought sometimes to think in centm-ies. I believe in Reclus's words, ' All 
man has hitherto done is a trifle in comparison with what he will be able 
to effect in future.' Science is like a woman. She says No again and again, 
but she means Yes in the end. 

In dealing with land and water I have touched upon natural divisions and 
natural boundaries, which are one of the provinces of geography. Flying gives 
the go-by to all natural divisions and boundaries, even the sea ; but let us come 
down to the earth. Isthmuses are natural divisions between seas ;, the ship 
canals cut them and link the seas — the canal through the Isthmus of Corinth, 
tlie canal which cuts the Isthmus of Perekop between the Crimea and the 
mainland of Russia, the Baltic Canal, the Suez Canal, the Panama Canal. The 
Suez Canal, it will be noted, though not such a wonderful feat as the Panama 
Canal, is more important from a geographical point of view, in that an open 
cut has been made from sea to sea without necessity for locks, which surmount 
the land barrier but more or less leave it standing. Inland, what are natural 
divisions? IMountains, forests, deserts, and, to some extent, rivers. Take 
mountains. ' High, massive mountain systems,' writes Miss Semple, ' present 
the most effective barriers which man meets on the land surface of the earth.' 
But are the Rocky Mountains, for instance, boundaries, dividing-lines, to 
anything like the extent that they were now that railways go through and over 
them, carrying hundreds of human beings back and fore day by day? On 
what terms did British Columbia join the Dominion of Canada? That the 
natural barrier between them .should be pierced by the railway. Take the 
Alps. The canton Ticino, running down to Lake Maggiore, is politically in 
Switzerland ; it is wholly on the southern side of the Alps. Is not the position 
entirely changed by the St. Gothard tunnel, running from Swiss territory into 
Swiss territory on either side of the motmtains ? 

If, in the Bible language, it requires faith to remove mountains, it is not 
wholly so with other natural boundaries. Forests were, in old days, very real 
natural dividing-lines. They were so in England, as in our own day they have 
been in Central Africa. Between forty and fifty years ago, in his ' Hi-storical 
Maps of England,' Professor C. H. Pearson, whose name is well known and 
honoured in Australia, laid down that England was settled from east and west, 
because over against Gaul were heavy woods, greater barriers than the sea. 
Kent was cut off from Central England by the Andred Weald, said to have 
been, in King Alfred's time, 120 miles long and .30 broad. Here are Professor 
Pearson's words : ' The axe of the woodman clearing away the forests, the 
labour of nameless Erenerations reclaiming the fringes of the fens or making 
their islands habitable, have gradually transformed England into one country, 
inhabited by one neonle. Rut the early influences of the woods and fens are 
to isolate and divide.' Thus the cutting down of trees is sometimes a good, 
not an evil, and there are some natural boundaries which man can wholly 
obliterate. 

Can the same be said of deserts? Thev can certainly be pierced, like 
isthmuses and like mountains. The Australian desert is a natural division 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 435 

between Western and South Australia. The desert will be tliore for many a 
long day after the transcontinental railway has been finished, bnt will it be. 
in anything like the same sense as before, a barrier placed by Natnro an&lt;l 
respected by man ? Nor do railways end with simply giving continuous communi- 
cation, except when they are in tunnels. As we all know, if population is avail- 
able, they bring in their train development of the land through which they pass. 
Are these deserts of the earth always going to remain, in Shakespeare's words, 
' deserts idle ' ? Is man going to obliterate them ? In the days to come, will the 
desert rejoice and blossom as the rose? What will dry farming and what will 
afforestation have to say? In the evidence taken in Australia by the Dominions 
Royal Commission, the Commissioner for Irrigation in New South Wales tells us 
that ' the dry farming areas are carried out westward into what are regarded as 
arid lands every year,' and that, in his opinion, ' we are merely on the fringe of 
dry farming ' in Australia. A book has lately been published entitled ' The Con- 
quest of the Desert.' The writer. Dr. Macdonald, deals with the Kalahari Desert 
in South Africa, which he knows well, and for the conquest of the desert he lays 
down that three things are essential — population, conservation, and afforesta- 
tion. He points out in words which might have been embodied in Mr. Marsli's 
book, how the desert zone has advanced through the reckless cutting of trees, 
and how it can be flung back again by tree barriers to the sand dunes. By 
conservation he means the system of dry farming so successful in the United 
States of America, which preserves the moisture in the soil and makes the 
desert produce fine crops of durum wheat without a drop of rain falling upon 
it from seedtime to harvest, and he addresses his book ' to the million settlers 
of to-morrow upon the dry and desert lands of South Africa.' If the settlers 
come, he holds that the agency of man, tree-planting, ploughing and harrowing 
the soil, will drive back and kill out the desert. The effect of tree-planting 
in arresting the sand dunes and reclaiming desert has been very marked in the 
Landes of Gascony. Here, I gather from Mr. Perkins' report, are some 3600 
square miles of sandy waste, more than half of which had, as far back as 1882, 
been converted into forest land, planted mainly with maritime pines. 

What, again, will irrigation have to say to the deserts? Irrigation, whether 
from underground or from overground waters, has already changed^ the face of 
the earth, and as the years go on, as knowledge grows and wisdom,_ must 
inevitably change it more and more. I read of underground waters in the 
Kalahari. I read of them too in the Libyan Desert. In the ' Geographical 
Journal ' for 1902 it is stated that at that date nearly 22,000 square miles in the 
Algerian Sahara had been reclaimed with water from artesian wells. What 
artesian and sub-artesian water has done for Australia you all know. If it is 
not so much available for agricultural purposes, it has enabled flocks and herds 
to live and thrive in what would be otherwise arid areas. Professor Gregory, 
Mr. Gibbons Cox, and others have written on this subject with expert knoav- 
ledge; evidence has been collected and published by the Dominions Royal Com- 
mission, but I must leave to more learned and more controversial men than I am 
to discuss whether the supplies are plutonic or meteoric, and how far in this 
matter you are living on your capital. 

If we turn to irrigation from overground waters, I hesitate to take illustra- 
tions from Australia, because my theme is the blotting out of the desert; and 
most of the Australian lands which are being irrigated from rivers, and made 
scenes of closer settlement, would be libelled if classed as desert. Mr. Elwood 
Mead told the Royal Commission that the State irrigation works in Victoria, 
already completed or in process of construction, can irrigate over 600 square 
miles, and that, if the whole water supply of the State were utilised, more like 
6000 square miles might be irrigated. The Burrinjuck scheme in New South 
Wales will irrigate in the first instance not far short of 500 square miles, but 
may eventually be made available for six times that area. If we turn to 
irrieation works in India, it appears from the second edition of Mr. Buckley's 
work on the subject, published in 1905, that one canal system alone, that of 
the Chenab in the Punjab, had, to quote his words, turned 'some two million 
acres of wilderness (over .3000 square miles) into sheets of luxuriant crops.' 
' Before the construction of the canal,' he writes, ' it was almost entirely waste, 
with an extremely small population, which was mostly nomad. Some portion of 
the country was wooded with Jungle trees, some was covered with small scrub

camel tliorn, .-incl large tracts were absolutely bare, producing ouly on occasions 
a brilliant mirage of unbounded sheets of fictitious water.' The Chenab irriga- 
tion works have provided for more than a million of human beings; and, taking 
the whole of India, the Irrigation Commission of 1901-3 estimated that the 
amount of irrigated land at that date was 68,750 square miles ; in other words, 
a considerably larger area than England and Wales. Sir William Willcocks has 
been reclaiming the delta of the Euphrates and Tigris. The area is given as 
nearly 19,000 square miles, and it is described as aloout two-thirds desert and 
one-third freshwater swamp. Over 4000 square miles of the Gezireh Plain, 
between the Blue and the White Nile, are about to be reclaimed, mainly for 
cotton cultivation, by constructing a dam on the Blue Nile at Sennaar and 
cutting a canal 100 miles long which, if I understand right, will join the White 
Nile, thirty miles south of Khartoum. 

With the advance of science, with the growing pressure of population on 
the surface of the earth, forcing on reclamation as a necessity for life, is it too 
much to contemplate that human agency in the coming time will largely oblite- 
rate the deserts which now appear on our maps ? It is for the young peoples of 
the British Empire to take a lead in — to quote a phrase from Lord Durham's 
great report — ' the war with the wilderness,' and the great feat of carrying 
water for 350 miles to Kalgoorlie, in the very heart of the wilderness, shows 
that Australians are second to none in the ranks of this war. 

It is a commonplace that rivers do not make good boundaries because they 
are easy to cross by boat or bridge. Pascal says of them that they are 
' des cliemins qui marchent ' (roads that move), and we have seen how these roads 
have been and are being improved by man. 'Rivers unite,' says Miss Semple ; 
and again, 'Rivers may serve as political lines of demarcation, and therefore fix 
political frontiers, but they can never take the place of natural boundaries.' 
All the same, in old times at any rate, rivers were very appreciable dividing- 
lines, and when you get back to something like barbarism, that is to say in time 
of war, it is realised how powerful a barrier is a river. Taking, then, rivers 
as in some sort natural boundaries, or treating them only as political boundaries, 
the point which I wish to emphasise is that they are becoming boundaries which, 
with modern scientific appliances, may be shifted at the will of man. In the 
days to come the diversion of rivers may become the diversion of a new race of 
despotic rulers with infinitely greater power to carry out their will or their 
whim than the Pharaohs possessed when they built the Pyramids. You in 
Australia know how thorny a question is that of the control of the Murray and 
its tributaries. There are Waterways Conventions between Canada and the 
United States. Security for the head-waters of the Nile was, and is, a prime 
necessity for the Sudan and Egypt. The Euphrates is being turned from one 
channel into another. What infinite possibilities of political and geographical 
complications does man's growing control over the flow of rivers present ! 

Thus I have given you four kinds of barriers or divisions set by Nature 
upon the face of the earth — mountains, forests, deserts, rivers. The first, the 
mountains, man cannot remove, but he can and he does go through them to save 
the trouble and difficulty of going over them. The second, the forests, he has 
largely cleared away altogether. The third, the deserts, he is beginning to 
treat like the forests. The fourth, the rivers, he is beginning to shift when 
it suits his purpose and to regulate their flow at will. 

I turn to climates. Climates are hot or cold, wet or dry, healthy or un- 
healthy. Here our old friends the trees have much to say. Climates beyond 
dispute become at once hotter and colder when trees have been cut down and 
the face of the earth has been laid bare ; they become drier or moister according 
as trees are destroyed or trees are planted and hold the moisture ; the cutting 
and planting of timber affects either one way or the other the health of a 
district. The tilling of the soil modifies the climate. This has been the case, 
according to general opinion, in the North-West of Canada, though I have not 
been able to secure any official statistics on the subject. In winter time broken 
or ploughed land does not hold the snow and ice to the same extent as the 
unbroken surface of the prairie ; on the other hand, it is more retentive at once 
of moisture and of the rays of the sun. The result is that the wheat zone has 
moved further north, and that the intervention of man has, at any rate for 
agricultural purposes, made the climate of the great Canadian North-West 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDKESS. 437 

perceptibly more favourable than it was. In Lord Strathcona's view, there was 
some change even before the settlers came in, as soon as the rails and telegraph 
lines of the Canadian Pacific Railway were laid. He told me that in carrying 
the line across a desert belt it was found that, within measurable distance of 
the rail and the telegraph line, there was a distinct increase of dew and 
moisture. I must leave it to men of science to say whether this was the result 
of some electrical or other force, or whether what was observed was due simply 
to a wet cycle coinciding with the laying of the rails and the erection of the 
wires. I am told that it is probably a coincidence of this kind which accounts 
for the fact that in the neighbourhood of the Assouan dam there is at present 
a small annual rainfall, whereas in past years the locality was rainless. Re- 
ference has already been made to the effect of cultivation in the Kalahari Desert 
in increasing the storage of moisture in the soil. But it is when we come to the 
division between healthy and unhealthy climates that the effect of science upon 
climate is most clearly seen. The great researches of Ross, Manson, Bruce, and 
many other men of science, British and foreign alike, who have traced malaria 
and yellow fever back to the mosquito, and assured the prevention and gradual 
extirpation of tropical diseases, bid fair to revolutionise climatic control. Note, 
however, fcliat in our penitent desire to preserve the wild fauna of the earth we 
are also establishing preserves for mosqiiitos, trypanosomes and the tsetse fly. 

Nowhere have the triumphs of medical science been more conspicuous than 
where engineers have performed their greatest feats. De Lesseps decided that 
Isnmilia should be the headquarters of the Suez Canal, but the prevalence of 
malaria made it necessary to transfer the headquarters to Port Said. In 1886 
there \vere 2300 cases of malaria at Ismailia ; in 1900 almost exactly the same 
number. In 1901 Sir Ronald Ross was called in to advise ; in 1906 there were no 
fresh cases, and malaria has been stamped out. Lesseps' attempt to construct 
the Panama Canal was defeated largely, if not mainly, by the frightful death- 
rate among the labourers; 50,000 lives are said to have been lost, the result of 
malaria and yellow fever. When the Americans took up the enterprise they 
started with sending in doctors and sanitary experts, and the result of splendid 
medical skill and sanitary administration was that malaria and yellow fever were 
practically killed out. The Panama Canal is a glorious creation of medical as well 
as of engineering science, and this change of climate has been mainly due to 
reclamation of pools and swamps, and to cutting down bush, for even the 
virtuous trees, under some conditions, conduce to malaria. Han is a geographical 
agency, and in no respect more than in the effect of his handiwork on climate, 
for climate determines products, human and others. Science is deciding that 
animal pests shall be extirpated in the tropics, and that there shall be no 
climates which shall be barred to white men on the ground of danger of infec- 
tion from tropical diseases. 

If we turn to products, it is almost superfluous to give illustrations of the 
changes wrought by man. As the incoming white man has in many places sup- 
planted the coloured aboriginal, so the plants and the living creatures brought 
in by the white man have in many cases, as you know well, ousted the flora 
and fauna of the soil. Here is one well-known illustration of the immigration 
of plants. Cliarles Darwin, on the voyage of the Bejujlv, visited the island of 
St. Helena in the year 1836. He wrote 'that the number of plants now 
found on the island is 746, and that out of these fifty-two alone are indigenous 
species.' The immigrants, he said, had been imported mainly from England. 
but some from Australia, and, he continued, 'the many imported species must 
have destroyed some of the native kinds, and it is only on the highest and 
steepest ridges that the indigenous flora is now predominant.' 

Set yourselves to write a geography of Australia as Australia was when first 
made known to Europe, and compare it with a geography now. Suppose 
Australia to have been fully discovered when Europeans first reached it, but 
consider the surface then and the surface now, and the living things upon the 
surface then and now. Will not man be found to have been a geographical 
agency? How much waste land, how many fringes of desert have been 
reclaimed? The wilderness has become pasture land, the pasture land is 
being converted into arable. The Blue Mountains, which barred the way to the 
interior, are now a health resort. Let us see what Sir Joseph Banks wrote 
after his visit to Australia on Captain Cook's first voyage in 1770. He has a 



438 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E. 

chapter headed ' Some Account of that part of New Holland now called New 
South Wales.' New Holland he thought 'in every respect the most barren 
country I have seen ' ; ' the fertile soil bears no kind of proportion to that which 
seems by nature doomed to everlasting barrenness.' 'In the whole length of 
coast which we sailed along there was a very unusual sameness to be observed 
in the face of the country. Barren it may justly be called, and in a very high 
degree, so far, at least, as we saw.' It is true that he only saw the land by the 
sea, but it was the richer eastern side of Australia, the outer edge of New 
South Wales and Queensland. What animals did he find in Australia ? He 
' saw an animal as large as a greyhound, of a mouse colour, and very swift.' 
' He was not only like a greyhound in size and running, but had a tail as long 
as any greyhound's. What to liken him to I could not tell.' Banks had a grey- 
hound with him, which chased this animal. ' We observed, much to our surprise, 
that, instead of going upon all fours, this animal went only on two legs, making 
vast bounds.' He found out that the natives called it kangooroo, and it was ' as 
large as a middling lamb.' He found ' this immense tract of land,' which he 
said was considerably larger than all Europe, ' thinly inhabited, even to admira- 
tion, at least that part of it that we saw.' He noted the Indians, as he called 
them, whom he thought 'a very pusillanimous people.' They 'seemed to have 
no idea of traffic'; they had 'a wooden weapon made like a short scimitar.' 
Suppose a new Sir Joseph Banks came down from the planet Mars to visit 
Australia at this moment, what account would he give of it in a geographical 
handbook for the children of Mars ? He would modify the views about barren- 
ness, if he saw the cornfields and floclis and herds; if he visited Adelaide, he 
would change his opinion as to scanty population, though not so, perhaps, if he 
went to the back blocks. He would record that the population was almost 
entirely white, apparently akin to a certain race in the North Sea, from which, 
by tradition, they had come; that their worst enemies could not call them 
pusillanimous; that they had some ideas of ti-affic, and used other weapons than 
a wooden scimitar ; and ho would probably give the first place in animal life not 
to the animal like a greyhound on two legs, but to the middling lamb, or 
perhaps to the ubiquitous rabbit. Australia is the same island continent that 
it always was ; there are the same indentations of coast, the same mountains 
and rivers, but the face of the land is different. In past years there was no 
town, and the country was wilderness ; on the surface of the wilderness many of 
the living things were different; and from under the earth has come water and 
mineral, the existence of which was not suspected. A century hence it will be 
different again, and I want to see sets of maps illustrating more clearly than is 
now the case tlic changes which successive generations of men have made and 
are making in the face of Australia and of the whole earth. 

More than half a century ago Buckle, in his ' History of Civilisation,' wrote : 
* Formerly the richest countries were those in which Nature was most bountiful ; 
now the richest countries are those in which man is most active. For in our age 
of the world, if Nature is parsimonious we know how to compensate her 
deficiencies. If a river is difficult to navigate, or a country difficult to traverse, 
an engineer can correct the error and remedy the evil. If we have no rivers 
we make canals; if we have no natui'al harbours we make artificial ones.' 
These words have a double force at the present day and in the present sur- 
roundings, for nowhere has man been more active as a geographical agency than 
in Australia; and not inside Australia only, but also in regard to the relations 
of Australia to the outside world. 

An island continent Australia is still, and always will be, on the maps. It 
always will be the same number of miles distant from other lands ; but will 
these maps represent practical everyday facts? What do miles mean when 
it takes a perpetually diminishing time to cover them? Is it not truer to 
facts to measure distances, as do Swiss guides, in Stunden (hours) ? What, 
once more, will an island continent mean if the sea is to be overlooked and 
overflown ? The tendency is for the world to become one ; and we know 
perfectly well that, as far as distance is concerned, for practical purposes 
the geographical position of Australia has changed through the agency of 
scientific man. If you come to think of it, what geography has been more 
concerned with than anything else, directly or indirectly, is distance. It is 



RESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 439 

tlie knowledge of other places not at our actual door that we teach in geography, 
how to get there, what to find when we get there, and so forth. The greatest 
revolution that is being worked in human life is the elimination of distance, 
and tliis elimination is going on apace. It is entering into every phase of public 
and private life, and is changing it more and more. The most difficult and 
dangerous of all Imperial problems at this moment is the colour problem, and 
this has been entirely created by human agency, scientific agency, bringing the 
lands of the coloured and the white men closer together. Year after year, 
because distance is being diminished, coming and going of men and of products 
is multiplying; steadily and surely the world is becoming one continent. This 
is what I want geographers to note and the peoples to learn. Geographers have 
recorded what the world is according to Nature. I want them to note and 
teach others to note how under an all-wise Providence it is being subdued, 
replenished, recast, and contracted by man.

The following Papers were read : — 
1. Australian Rainfall. By H. A. Hunt, Commonwealth Meteorologist, 

The main factors to be considered in relation to the controlling causes of 
rainfall in Australia are the south-east and westerly trade winds, the 
monsoonal and southern depressions, cyclones from the north-east and north- 
west tropics, locally formed cyclones, and the anticyclones, in conjunction with 
the modifying effects on these various atmospheric movements of the physical 
features of the different parts of the country. 

Around the central dry area of Australia the isohyets describe somewhat 
concentric curves, the modifications being mostly due to variations in elevation. 
Thus, the Darling Ranges to a great degree account for the rainfall of the 
south-west corner of the continent. The Flinders Range (South Australia) 
and Australian Alps in the south-east have a heavier rainfall than the surround- 
ing tracts owing to their cooling effect on the air-currents. Along the eastern 
elevated margin of the Commonwealth the ridges between large river-valleys 
also account for an enhanced precipitation. Examples of the latter type are the 
Peak Range and Darling Downs in Queensland, where the eastern ranges of the 
northern parts of that State obstruct the south-east trade winds and cause 
our heaviest rainfall. In Western Tasmania there is an excessive rainfall for 
similar reasons, though there the westerly trades are the moisture-laden winds. 

During the hotter months, November to April inclusive, the northern parts 
of Australia are wet and the southern dry, and in the colder months, May to 
October inclusive, the southern parts are wet and the northern dry, while over 
the eastern areas of the continent the rainfall is distributed fairly generally 
throughout the year. 

The southern portions of the continent, where the precipitations are con- 
trolled by the ' stormy westerlies,' southern cyclones and V-shaped depressions, 
enjoy very consistent annual totals, but north of the tropics, and in fact in all 
parts of the continent subject to monsoon rains, the departures from the 
normal are occasionally very great. 

When the monsoonal disturbances are in evidence, the effect of the rainfall 
on the country generally and the economic results for the succeeding season 
are very pronounced. The interior of the continent becomes transformed. 
The plains, which ordinarily have an intensifying effect on the heat winds 
of the summer, are deluged with rain, and respond immediately with a luxurious 
growth of grass and herbage. The air is then both tempered in heat and loses 
its dryness for considerable periods. 

The monsoon region comprises the whole of Australia north of the Tropic 
of Capricorn, together with Southern Queensland and the north of New South 
Wales. The heaviest rains are in January and February. They are directly 



440 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B. 

due to the indraught caused by the heating of the centre of the continent. This 
leads to the formation of a low pressure in Northern Australia, and the ascend- , 
ing winds are cooled and deposit their water-vapour in heavy rainstorms and 
thunder showers. 

Tropical depressions when well developed are productive of good inland 
rains, and are evidently caused by southward flows of the atmosphere of wide 
extent and considerable depth. The ' Antarctic ' disturbances are, however, the 
more frequent in winter. The heaviest totals from this last-named source are 
precipitated on the west coast of Tasmania. Thus at Mount Lyell the total 
for one year exceeded 140 inches, and even the averaic;e is 116'05 inches. When 
an ' Antarctic ' is supplemented by a ' trough ' extending well into the northern 
interior, it brings much rain to the inland areas of South Australia, Victoria, 
New South Wales, and even Queensland. 

Anticyclonic rains occur at all times of the year, but more markedly from 
March to September. They benefit particularly the southern area of the 
continent, and are responsible for many of the heaviest rainfalls and floods on 
the coastal districts of New South Wales. 

Flood rains occur at infrequent intervals over various portions of the 
Commonwealth, principally in Queensland, the south-eastern parts of the 
continent, and the northern regions of West Australia. 

Typical instances of floods in South-eastern Australia are (1) the flood which 
occurred in January 1910 in the Upper Darling tributaries, consequent on 
abnormally heavy rains on the north-western plains and slopes of New South 
Wales, as well as on the Darling Downs of Queensland. 

These exceptionally heavy, continuous rains were caused by the joint action 
of an anticyclonic area over the southern regions and a monsOonal depression 
operating in the northern half of the continent. A monsoonal tongue developed 
and extended southwards over Queensland and New South Wales, while at the 
same time the energy of the high pressure in the south increased. In five days 
large areas in the two States had from 5 inches to 19 inches of rain. 
The enormous amount of water which fell over approximately 86,000 square miles 
of country may be roughly estimated at thirty-one billion, six hundred and 
eighty-seven million (31,687,000,000) tons, or seven thousand one hundred 
billion (7,100,000,000,000) gallons. 

(2) A similar development occurred in March of the present year, when a 
monsoonal tongue extending southwards across the continent against an 
intensified anticyclone in the south was accompanied by severe thunderstorms 
and torrential rains. Some of the heaviest individual falls were in New South 
Wales; Q.rj., Taralga on the Central Tablelands 10-74 inches, Sydney 8-49 inches, 
Parramatta 16-91 inches, and Beecraft 18'8-t inches in the metropolitan area, and 
Wollongong 25-34 inches, on the south coast. The barometer readings at Sydney 
ranged from 30'13 inches to 29-97 inches during the five days the storms were 
in progress, while the anticyclone to the south gradually gave way simul- 
taneously, the centre (30-4 inches) moving slowly over the southern parts of 
Victoria and Tasmania eastwards to the South Pacific Ocean. 

The wettest known place in Australia is Innisfail, on the north-east coast of 
Queensland, where the average rainfall for twenty-one years is no less thaji 
145 inches, the maximum yearly total being 211-24 inches, and the niininnun 
G9-87 inches. 

The driest region so far furnished with rain gauges lies east and north-east 
from Lake Eyre, where less than 5 inches is the average annual rainfall, and 
where a total of 10 inches is rarely recorded daring the twelve months. This 
minimum rainfall is coincident with the lowest elevation. Lake Eyre being 
actually below sea-level 39 feet. 

The inland districts of Western Australia have until recent years been 
regarded as the driest part of the Commonwealth, but authentic observations 
taken during the past decade at settled districts in the east of that State show 
that the annual average is from 10 to 12 inches. 

In comparing the rainfall of the chief cities of the rest of the world i with 

1 Amsterdam, Athens, Berlin, Berne, Bombay, Brussels, Budapest, Buenos 
Ayres, Calcutta, Cape Town, Chicago, Christiania, Colombo, Constantinople, 
Copenhagen, Dublin, Edinburgh, Genoa, Hong Kong, Johannesburg, Lisbon, 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E. 441 

those of Australia, it is found that Bombay, Calcutta, Colombo, biiigaporc, and 
Hong Kong are the only cities whose rainfall exceeds that of Sydney and 
Brisbane. Perth has a greater annual rainfall than New York, and more than 
that of twenty-eiglit of the forty-two cities used in the comparison. Hobart 
nearly equals London, which Melbourne exceeds by an inch, while eleven of 
the fortv-two places considered have less rain than Hobart. 

The distribution of average annual rainfall over the Commonwealth and 
the United Kingdom in thousands of square miles is as follows : — 

Au.straHa British Isles 

Under 10 in 1,045 nil 

10 in. to 15 in 652 ml

20 in. to 30 in 503 24 

30 in. to 40 in 199 42 

Over 40 in 160 55 

The average area under wheat in the United Kingdom during the years 
1910, 1911, and 1912 was 1,926,040 acres, and the average yield 59,4;^6,392 
bu.shels ; while in the Commonwealth for the same period the area under wheat 
was 7,379.980 acres, and the average yield 86,243,133 bushels, a difference in 
the total yield in favour of Australia of 26,806,741 bushels. In Australia wheat- 
growing under ordinary conditions is generally considered a safe and payable 
proposition when 10 inches of rain and over falls from the month of April to 
that of October inclusive. There are in all 484,330 square miles of country with 
10 inches of rainfall and over during the wheat-growing period. The output 
of wheat has been steadily increasing from year to year, and there are vast 
possibilities of future development in this direction. 

The climatic history and prosperity of the last ten years or so contradict 
emphatically the preconceived notion that Australia is the particular drought- 
.stricken and precarious area of the earth's surface. These misconceptions of 
the true character of the country have been held in the developmental stages, 
to a greater or less extent, in the early histories in the majority of all lands 
and in the colonisation of newly discovered territories; e.{/., see history of 
colonisation of U.S. America and early Egyptian history. The truth of the 
matter about Australia's rainfall is that (1) it is generally ample for 
pastoral and agricultural industries over two-thirds of its area ; (2) that different 
regions have distinct seasonal dry and wet periods. These must be more fully 
recognised and industrial operations adapted accordingly ; (3) it is subject in 
part, but never in the whole, to prolonged periods when the rainfall is short 
of the seasonal average. Australia is not peculiar in this respect. It follows, 
therefore, that as the so far undeveloped country becomes populated and put 
to jirofitable use, the general wealth of the community as a whole will steadily 
increase. 

A model representing the relative rainfall over Australia has been constructed 
at tlie Commonwealth Weather Bureau on a horizontal scale of 133 miles to 
1 inch and a vertical scale of 10 inches to 1 centimetre. 

It shows at a glance how the annual rainfall is distributed, from the sni;ill 
precipitation over the far interior to the fringe of high rainfall around the 
greater portion of the coast-line, culminating on the eastern side in a great 
lieak indicating the annual precipitation over the Harvey Creek and Innisfail 
district, resulting from the prevailing south-east trade winds carrying the 
moisture against the mountain ranges just inside the coast. 

The fringe of relatively high rainfall along the eastern and south-eastern 
coasts of the continent as the result of the elevated contours near the coast in 
those regions is also striking. 

The effect of the monsoonal rains over Northern Australia is very apparent 
from the model, which shows the gradual increase of rainfall from under 10 
inches in tlie interior to over 60 inches on the north coast.

442 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E. 

along the southern portion of the Commonwealth is clearly marked by the 
elevations indicating the good rains received over the south-west corner of 
Australia, and, further eastward, how the ranges east of Adelaide cause good 
rainfall there and prevent the rain from that direction reaching the inland 
parts of Victoria. 

In Tasmania, also is seen the effect of the frequency of the moist westerly 
winds, causing high rainfall along the mountain ranges of the west coast, with 
resulting comparative dryness in the eastern parts of that State. 

It may be of interest to note in closing that there exists apparently an 
oscillatory movement of the seasonal rains throughout Australia about a centre 
in the vicinity of fi^orbes, in New fciouth Wales. It is perhaps a natural 
coincidence that this apparent centre of oscillation is approximately the centre 
of gravity of the Commonwealth's population, and is not far from the Federal 
capital site. 

This peculiar oscillatory character of the monthly march of rainfall suggested 
the construction of a ' Rain Clock.' In the centre of a piece of cardboard a map 
of Australia is cut out with a die. At the back of this another piece of card- 
board, indicating the rain area, is manipulated on a swivel. By moving the 
second piece of cardboard backwards and forwards with an amplitude of oscilla- 
tion of one-fifth of a circle, the land area of the continent affected by dry or 
wet conditions at any time of the year is approximately indicated. 

The immediate lessons to be learned from a study of the ' Clock ' are that the 
seasonal rains are more regular than was generally believed, and that the 
alternating dry and wet seasons are definitely defined. That being so, when in 
obedience to physical law there is an absence of rain during the normally dry 
period in any part of Australia, such dryness should not be regarded as 
drought, and an evil, but rather as Nature's wise provision for resting the soil. 



2. Tlie ' Mallee ' Country of North-Wedern Victoria. 
By A. S. Kenyon, C.E. 

The term ' Mallee,' applied to the scrubby forms of Eucalypt cliaracteristic 
of the area to be described, is of aboriginal origin. 

The Mallee country embraces over 11,000,000 acres and includes the greater 
part of the north-western portion of the State, over one-fifth of its total area. 
It is sharply diiferentiated from other districts by its soils, plants, and general 
surface configuration. 

Surface Formation. — The i)revailing feature is the regular occurrence of sand- 
ridges — of no great height, generally less than 30 feet. They are more or less 
parallel, running from W.S.W. to E.N.E. With an increase in their height, the 
scil becomes noticeably poorer ; at times they are over 100 feet above the sur- 
rounding surface, when the parallelism is almost completely masked and they 
form a jumble of sand-hills, locally known as ' desert.' More or less extensive 
expanses of level land with low irregular undulating rises are termed ' broken ' 
country. 

Soil. — The soil varies from rich red clayey loams in the ' broken ' country 
to pure white sand in the ' sandhills,' and, except in the latter class, is all 
suitable for agriculture. Limestone nodules occur almost everywhere, in places 
becoming almost massive; outcrops of tertiary agglomerated ferruginous sand- 
stone are plentiful. Salt lakes, generally in the vicinity of the more extensive 
limestone beds, accompanied with ' copi ' or gypsum earth deposits, are 
numerous. These have rarely any inflow of water, and their saltness in every 
case may be put down to upward filtration. Swamps and terminal lakes without 
any outflow are, however, generally fresh. The ' broken ' country occupies 
about 20 per cent., the sand-ridges cover 60 per cent., while the sand-hills 
account for less than 30 per cent. 

Plants.— The sand-ridge country is densely covered with E. Dumosa and 
its varieties. Broom-bush {Boeckea) marks the transition stage into sand-hills 
with their desert types of C'asuarina, Callitris, GreviUia, Hakea, Melaleuca, and 
Eimr.ris. The ' broken' country has large mallee, big pines [Callitris rohusta), 
buloke, and belar [Casuariiia luchmanni and lepidophloia), sandalwood [Myo- 



TRAKSACTIONS OF SECTION E. 443 

porum plati/carpum and Erciiiophila longijoliu) and a great variety ot shrubs 
[Heterodtudron, Fusunus, Pittosporum, acacias, &amp;c.), forming probably the most 
park-like country in Australia. The so-called spinifex, Triodia irritans, the 
porcupine-grass of the settlers, prevails throughout. Salt-bush plains comprising 
a large number of the Chenopodiacese vary from a few to many thousand acres. 
Grasses are of the tufty, tussocky order, and rarely form a sod or sole of grass 
Bufficient to prevent sand-drift. 

Climate. — The Mallee is arid. Its rainfall varies from 19 to a little under 
11 inches per annum, averaging 14 inches. In summer the days are intensely 
hot and the air excessively dry ; consequently there is frequently a considerable 
drop in temperature at night-time, the range being over 7U° F. In winter, the 
days arc bright and sunny with much frost at night, temperatures going com- 
monly below 'M)° F. Cyclones of destructive foi'ce are rare. 

Geology. — The surface soils are almost wholly seolian or wind-redistributed ; 
this formation extends to 30 feet and over in depth. They have been formed 
from lacustrine clays and drifts, which are some 200 feet in thickness. Below 
these beds, enclosed above and below by estuarial blue clays containing broken 
shells, foraminifera, glauconite, &amp;c., are extensive marine formations, poly- 
zoal and shell rocks of about the same thickness as the overlying lacustrine 
beds. Below these are terrestrial fluviatile deposits containing much lignite and 
pyrites. The thickness of these, which rest upon palaeozoic, Silurian, or granite 
beds, is variable, reaching 700 feet. The sequence of beds shows in the Tertiary 
l)eriod a considerable subsidence followed by elevation. While the elevation 
was in progress and the sea had retreated, the streams at present joining the 
Murray River flowed in and formed the lacustrine deposits until, uniting forces, 
they cut a canyon through them to the sea. The Murray River canyon has a 
depth of 60 to 200 feet, and a width of 1^ to 4 miles. A distinct folding in the 
whole series of Tertiary beds has been shown by the borings. At the surface 
these folds are many miles in width and are over 200 feet in height and have 
a direction a little west of north — at right angles to the sand-ridges — with a 
marked easterly dip. It is not unlikely that the salt and gypsum areas above 
referred to mark the synclines, where fracturing allows escape of the artesian 
v.aters of the coral marine beds. 

Settlement. — There are at present five and a half million acres under settle- 
ment, of which about one and a half million acres are under cultivation annually, 
supporting a population of over 40,000.

Surface. By 11. Yule Oldham, M.A. 



4. 'Hie Central Highlands and ' Main IJivide ' of ]'icloria. 
By T. S. Hart, M.A., B.C.E., F.G.S. 

A belt of highlands extends through almost the whole length of Victoria. 
These consist of a peneplain carved out of Palajozoic rocks, and subsequently 
elevated in blocks to varying heights and dissected. Remnants of older hills 
above the peneplain are of minor importance. 

On these Palasozoic rocks rest fluviatile and lacustrine deposits of Tertiary 
age. The fossils and relation to marine Tertiaries further south indicate a 
position low in the Tertiaries for the oldest of these. The formation of the 
peneplain may be regarded as early Tertiary. In Southern Victoria worn down 
Jurassic rocks form part of the peneplain. On the Central Highlands and south- 
of them there are also two series of volcanic rocks, known respectively as the 
older volcanic (early Tertiary) and newer volcanic (late Tertiary). 

The central belt of highlands is outside the limits of the Jurassic coal- 
bearing sediments and of the marine Tertiaries. This area has been relatively 
high from Jurassic time onward, and has been much more elevated in Tertiary 
times than the marine Tertiary area. 

Tlie general effect produced by the elevaiion has been a broad belt of high- 
lands falling away to north and south and higher at the eastern end. In detail 



4:44 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E. 

this area consists of numerous fault-blocks, more or less tilted, and unequally 
elevated, producing original crests and valleys. As the crests of the blocks are 
often transverse to the east and west trends of the whole highlands, the two 
ends of a relatively low strip may be occupied by streams flowing to north and 
south respectively. The main water-parting or Main Divide between the north 
and south streams varies in its relation to the fault-blocks, being determined in 
part by crests of tilted blocks, or by relatively high blocks, in part by the 
position of the Divide at the head of streams flowing in opposite directions 
in the same low area, and in part by volcanic accumulations. 

It is not necessary to suppose a single original Main Divide from which 
streams flowed directly to the lowlands north and south. On the contrary, there 
is distinct evidence of a more complex arrangement of the original crests so 
that some areas had less direct outlets — for example, a well-marked east and 
west crest south of Ballarat is connected by a meridional ridge east of that 
town to the Main Divide producing two basins, that of Ballarat, and that of 
the original Parwan ; the present southerly valleys of the Moorabool, Yarrowee, 
and Smythe's Creek are cut later through this southern crest. The presence 
of original difficulty-drained areas has probably made alterations in the 
drainage system easier, both by capture and by diversions after volcanic in- 
filling. Alterations are also facilitated by diiierential movements after the 
present drainage system was initiated on the rising jieneplain. 

The Upper Goulburn has probably been formed by linking by capture of 
originally distinct basins. The same has very likely occurred in the case of 
the Yarra. The alterations near Ballarat are largely due to volcanic accumu- 
lations. 

The Main Divide is sometimes volcanic, as in parts near Ballarat, where it is 
formed by materials accumulated round several vents. 

The actual intrusion of the granitic rocks has taken no part in forming the 
present Divide. These rocks have moved with the others in block movements. 
They are evidently more likely to be exposed on the peneplain at places of 
much elevation prior to its completion. Some of these situations would no 
doubt continue to be much elevated later. 

■Some of the boundaries of the granitic areas are fault-lines from which 
the granitic country rises rapidly (Mount Cole, Mount Martha, Arthur's Seat). 
Some of the Palteozoic dacites also make very prominent hills (Mount Macedon, 
The Dandenongs). In these cases the hard rocks on the uplifted side still 
present some considerable steepness due to the original fault-scarp. 

5. A Map of the Environs of Rome of 1647. By Dr. Thomas Asiiby. 

The Vatican Library has, by a recent gift of His Holiness the Pope, come 
into possession of an important collection of maps and plans. This includes an 
engraved map of the environs of Rome for a distance of about twenty miles in 
each direction, on the scale of about two inches to the mile. It bears the date 
1547, and is unsigned ; but Mr. Horatio F. Browne has discovered the Venetian 
privilege for it, from which it appears that its author was a Florentine, 
Eufrosino della Volpaia. It is rather a bird's-eye view than a map, the pro- 
jection not being accurate, but the details (roads, farms, streams, woods, culti- 
vation, &amp;c.) are very well shown ; and it is the largest map of this district known 
until comparatively modern times. Though it is engraved on six copper 
plates, and served as the original of Ortelius' map, it has remained unknown 
until now, and the Vatican copy is unique. Dr. Ashby has written the text to 
the publication in facsimile made by the Vatican Library in a series which it is 
now issuing (' Le Piante Maggiori di Roma dei secoli 16° e 17" '). 



6. Three Early Australian Geographers, their Work, and how it is 
Remembered. By Chaeles E. Loxg, M.A., Inspector of Schools, 
and Editor of the Education Department's Publications , Victoria. 

In Australia, the scope of the geography syllabus, especially that of the 
State elementary school, is comprehensive, and the time apportioned to the 



TRANSAOTTONS OF SROTTON K. 445 

siilijoot is libenil. Of l:ile years, a feature of tlio teaching lias been the con- 
iieuting of the physical features of the continent with those who discovered, 
explored, and named them, and of the towns with their founders and early 
residents. The map has thus become invested with a human interest that 
serves to give an attraction to the acquirement of topographical details which 
it did not formerly possess. This mode of connecting history with geography 
has also been to the benefit of the former. The strongly established subject, 
geography, has helped to place the weak subject, Australian history, on its 
feet. Another effect of adding humanity to geographical nomenclature has 
been to direct the minds of Australian children, and through them of their 
parents, to the early Australian geographers. The value to the nation of these 
intrepid men is rapidly obtaining recognition ; and when you add to that 
recognition the result of the giving over of a day annually on which the 
exploits of the explorers and pioneers are made the sole topic of instruction in 
the schools (as is the case in Victoria), you will see that the time is ripe for 
the erection of historical monuments and for the proper appreciation of those 
already erected. 

Of the many men deserving of recognition at the hands of Australians 
three stand out prominently, the navig,ators, James Cook and Matthew Flinders, 
and the surveyor, Thomas Mitchell. The geographical work of these men was 
of immense importance to Australia. 

There is no record of any visit to the eastern shore of the continent before 
that of Cook, who charted the coast-line for some 2000 miles with an approach 
to accuracy that astonishes the hydrographers of the present day when they 
consider the disadvantages luider which he carried it out. 

Among Australian explorers he is easily first in public estimation, some- 
times, indeed, being credited by those whose enthusiasm is greater than their 
hi.storical knowledge with being the discoverer of the island-continent. Public 
admiration has been shown in the memorials erected to him. At Botany Baj', 
where he first landed on the Australian soil, there is a tablet affixed to a rock, 
and also an obelisk. Sydney possesses a fine statue. At Cooktown, Queens- 
land, where the ' Endeavour ' was careened at the mouth of a river that bears its 
name, ds another obelisk, and a tree is still reverently preserved as that to 
which the .ship was tied. An admirer at Bendigo, the ' Quartzopolis ' of 
Victoria, has placed a statue of the great navigator in immediate proximity to 
the principal Anglican church. And, soon, the St. Kilda Esplanade, Victoria, 
will be graced by a replica of the fine statue at Whitby, Yorkshire. 

Next to Cook comes Captain Matthew Flinders, who did a greater amount 
of surveying along the coast of Australia than any other man. In 1792 he 
began it with Bligh in Torres Strait, to which he returned ten j-ears after- 
wards. In 179.5 he ventured forth with his intrepid companion. Surgeon Bass, 
in a boat south from Sydney, with the result that he was able to show to the 
Governor, Captain Hunter, a chart that won his admiration. Then, with 
joyful enthusiasm, he went round Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) in the 
sloop ' Norfolk,' and, after that, from Sydney to Moreton Bay. Lastly, in the 
' Investigator,' fully accredited by the Admiralty, he began to chart the coast 
of the continent. Starting at Cape Leeuwin, he worked his way patiently along 
the coast to Sydney, and thence to the north-east of ArnhemLand. at which 
point the rotten state of his ship made it imperative for him to bring his survey 
to a close. His charts are so good that subsec^uent surveyors have had little to 
do in the way of amending them. 

The first of Australia's memorials to Flinders was erected in 1841 by the 
Governor of Van Diemen's Land, Sir John Franklin, who had been a midship- 
man on board the 'Investigator.' It stands overlooking the fine harbour of 
Port Lincoln, South Australia. Tlie people of that State have not forgotten the 
good example then set them. They have erected a monument on Kangaroo 
Island to commemorate its discovery by Flinders, a column on Mount Lofty for 
a similar purpose, and to the Bluff, in the Encounter Bay district, have affixed 
a plate to recall to mind the meeting of Flinders and the French explorer, 
Baudin. Victorians have recently awakened to a recognition of the debt they owe 
to the man who spent a week in Port Phillip Bay in 1802, and whose excellent 
chart was used by the early explorers of their State. On Discovery Day, 1912, 



446 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E. 

Sir Jolin Fuller, the State Governor, unveiled a tablet affixed to the granite tor 
at the summit of Station Peak, near Gcelong, on which Flinders stood to survey 
the bay on May 1, 1802. At Western Port there is a cairn and tablet which 
were unveiled by his Excellency the following Discovery Day. It commemorates 
the discovery of that inlet by Bass in 1798, and the first passage of the Strait 
by him and Flinders later in the year. Lastly, led by the members of the 
Victoria Branch of the Eoyal Geographical Society, an effort that will soon be 
consummated was set on foot some time ago to erect a worthy statue of Flinders 
in Melbourne. 

Thomas Mitchell, who was appointed Surveyor-General of New South Wales 
in 1827, had seen service with Wellington throughout the Peninsular War, and 
had been allowed by him to employ his talent for military sketching and plan- 
making. To this fine training was added a love for his work as a surveyor and 
explorer, together with much energy. He well deserved the knighthood that 
was bestowed upon him. Before his death at Sydney, in 1855, he had recorded 
a vast amount of detail in connection with the physical features of Eastern 
Australia. 

Of his four great expeditions — the first to the north of New South Wales, 
the second to the Darling near Bourke and then down that river, the third 
through Western and Central Victoria (his Australia Felix), and the fourth into 
Central Queensland — the third proved of inestimable service to the .young 
colony by attracting settlers to it. This fact is now being recognised by 
Victorians. With the Di.=;cov€ry Day celebrations has been associated the 
unveiling of a tablet to his memory at Pyramid Hill, where he stood on 
June 30, 1836, and surveyed the charming prospect around him ; of a second on 
Mount Arapiles. which he ascended on July 23; and a third at Expedition 
Pass, through which he journeyed on September 29. Owing to the enthusiasm 
teachers are showing in the matter, it is certain that, in the near future, his 
line of march in Victoria will be well indicated by tablets.

3. Recent advances in the Map of the World on. the Scale of 
1:1,000,000. By Frofessor A. Penck. 

The proposal for an international map of the world on a uniform scale has 
been considerably advanced in the last few years. A conference of delegates 
of several States held in London in 1910 approved the general scheme adopted 
by various Geographical Congresses since 1893 — namely, the scale of the map 
to be 1 : 1,000,000, each sheet to be plotted on its own surface and to be limited 
by parallels at a distance of 4 degrees in latitude and by meridians at a distance 
of 6 degrees in longitude, the meridians to be reckoned from Greenwich, the 
map to be a hypsometrical map, the contour lines of which should be given in 
hundreds of metres. The resolutions of the London conference were carried

out by several States, and maps after the srlienie proposed were piepared by 
Great" Britain, France, Italy, Spain, the United States of Amerira, Argentina, 
Chile, Japan, and in Portugal and Hungary. Much work has been done for the 
map also in Sweden. At the International Geographical Congress of r.ome, 1913. 
it was seen that these maps showed many differences in their mctliods and execu- 
tion, and the Congress recommended a second international conference of dele- 
gates of States. This conference was held in Paris in December 1913 ; the 
number of States represented at it — 34 — showed how general the interest in the 
map had become. The resolutions adopted did not alter the general scheme of 
the map, but settled many of its minor features. 

In Aiistralia the scheme was discussed in 1912 by a conference between the 
surveyors-general of the different States, and its execution was recommended 
to the Commonwealth. A map on a uniform but not too small a scale would 
indeed be of the greatest value to Australia, for there is none at present. The 
different States have hitherto only maps of their own territory, and these maps 
are unequal as to scale and contents. One feature is common to all — thej- do not 
lay stress upon the representation of morphological features, and our knowledge 
of the extent and height of the physical regions of Australia is limited. In order 
to extend the international map of the world to Australia extensive surveys are 
still necessary. It would be an important result of the scheme for a uniform 
map of the world if it should excite interest in the hypsometrical surveys of 
Australia.

The following Papers were read : — 

1. The Development of ihe Natural Order Leguni'mosce — A Study in 
Pal(2ogeography. By E. C. Andrews, B.A., F.G.S., Geological 
Surveyor, Nciv South Wales. 

A study of Leguminosc-B indicates that the final separation of Australia from 
Tropical Asia took place before that of Tropical America from Tropical Africa. 

This problem admits of comprehension only by a knowledge of the succession 
of geographies in post-Jurassic time, the character and home of the primitive 
types of the Order, the soils and climate which various legumes favour, the 
principles of plant dispersion by sea and land, as well as the arrest of develop- 
ment in certain types, and the wonderful vitality in others, such as Acacia and 
Astragalus ; these principles are all elaborated in the main discussion. 

Geography. — Extensive and low-lying plains of erosion, large epicontinental 
seas, and genial climate, were features of the iCretaceous geography, while large 
continents, great deserts, small epicontinental seas, high mountains, glaciated 
poles, and a general differentiation of climate into zones are characteristic of 
modern geography. 

Primitive Types. — Home, the fertile tropics. Trees or shrubs, of luxuriant 
habit. Leaves simple, sometimes digitate or simply pinnate. Corolla regular, 
petals five. Stamens definite, five or ten, free, sometimes indefinite. Style 
simple, peculiar. Fruit a pod or drupe. 

The narrow belt of tropical land extending south of the Equator from 
Tropical America to Australia, by way of Tropical Africa, Madagascar, and 
Malaysia, was broken up at its eastern end in Upper Cretaceous time, and, 
still later, it was broken in its central and western portions. IMany remark- 
able groups of genera were developed from the fertile tropical types as the 
result of the severe climatic conditions and poor soils of Australia, South 
Africa, and Eurasia. IMost remarkable of these are, in the first place, the 
Podalyriea; of Australia and South Africa, which were derived from the tropical 
Sophorere; secondly, the Genistere of Australia, South Africa, and Eurasia; 
thirdly, the Galegere of Eurasia; and fourthly, the Acacias of Australia, Africa, 
and America. 

Comparisons of these xerophytic forms indicate that, region for region, they 
are only indirectly related to each other by intermediate forms to be found in 



448 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E. 

the tropics. For example, the Podalyriere of Australia, Routli Africa, and the 
Northern Hemisphere are related to each other through SophoreK. The 
p]urasian types have been dispersed, during late geological time, to North 
America by way of North-eastern Asia, and thence filong the high wesiein 
plateaus to South America. 

Antiquity of Isolation of Australia.— GreRt genera, such as Mimosa, and 
Calliandra, are absent from Australia but are present in America, Africa, and 
Asia. The peculiar group of the Australian Podalyrieae, comprising nineteen 
endemic genera and about four hundred species, also speaks eloquently of the 
long separation of Australia from Asia. The history of Acacia also "may be 
summarised in this connection. The genus is divided into Gummiferre, 
Vulgares, Filicinpe, Pulchellffi, Botryocephalse, and Phyllodinere. Species 700. 
The GummiferEE are the primitive type, and are well developed in America, 
Africa, and Asia, only poorly represented in Australia and quite absent from 
Europe and New Zealand. They represent the xerophytic modification of a 
luxuriant Cretaceous plant, with bipinnate leaves, even at a time when the 
great continents were connected by way of the tropics. The Vulgares are the 
most important types, numerically, in extra-Australian areas, being abundant 
in America, Africa, and Asia. They are absent from Australia. The Filicinre 
belong to Tropical America. The Pulchellfe and the Botryocephala; are 
endemic in West and South-East Australia respectively. The Phyllodineoe, with 
about 420 species, are Australian. Of these the Uninerves represent the earlier 
type, and are characteristic of jioor, sandy soils. The home was Northern 
Australia. In the early stages the phyllode was narrow with the midrib form- 
ing the greater portion. The Pleurinerves appear to be modified Uninerves. 
Both types gradually pushed their way into the deserts, into West and South- 
east Australia, and into Tasmania. The Uninerves established themselves 
strongly in the cooler regions of the south, while the Pleurinerves, with the 
.Tuliflorpe, lagged behind and entrenched themselves securely in the iropies. 
Both during, and subsequently to, the formation of the great plateaus of Eastern 
Australia many peculiar phyllodineous types were developed, such as the 
Racemosre and the Tetramerje, and these, in part, during the later glacial period, 
moved northwards along the plateaus as far as South-eastern Queensland ; others 
again adapted themselves to subarid inland conditions. The endemic 
Botryocephalse, also, are in the main a response to plateau development in 
South-east Australia during later and post-Tertiary time. The western 
alluvial plains of Eastern Australia, formed during late and post-Tertiary time, 
gave rise to groups of the Pleurinerves, such as the Microneurse. 

In conclusion, Australia has been isolated from Asia for a great period, 
and the Leguminosre of the fertile tropics of the island continent are not com- 
paratively recent and derivative, as has been stated, but are examples of types 
once cosmopolitan, whose development has long been arrested while the great 
majority of the endemic types are j'ounger and vigorous xerophytes induced by 
tlie altered geographical conditions. 

2. Eastern A^istralian Topography and its Effect on the Native Flora. 
By E. H. Cambage, F.L.S., dc., Chief Mining Surveyor, Neiv 
So^ith Wales. 

The chain of mountains known as the Great Dividing Range extends through- 
out the length of Eastern Australia at distances varying from about twenty 
to nearly three hundred miles from the coast-line. It consists of an u])lifted 
dissected plateau ranging from about 1,500 to 7,300 feet above sea level, the 
generally lower portions being in Queensland, and the higher in southern New 
South Wales and Victoria. In general the eastern face is fairly steep and 
high, and exercises more influence in differentiating the humid climate of the 
east from the drier climate of the west, than does the actual water-parting itself, 
which is often only a slight ridge in various positions on the plateau. The effect 
of the mountains in the south is to create three climates, a humid and dry one 
on the east and west sides respectively, and a cold one on the summit which 
acts as a barrier between two floras which would otherwise commingle to some 
extent at lower levels. 



TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION E. 449 

111 Qut'Ciislaiitl a goiieially lower smniiiit of tlie plateau, and an iiKiease in 
teinperature owing to tlie more northerly position of the range, permit the 
western or dry influence to cross the mountains in various places, and allow many 
interior types of plants to thrive on the eastern watershed, while the moist- 
loving or coastal brush plants are excluded from these invaded areas. This 
invasion occurs in the Goulburn River valley near Cassilis in New South Wales, 
and at such places ia Queensland as between Toowoomba and Brisbane, between 
Jericho and Rockhampton, and at other points. Where such a mountain passage 
occurs the moist-loving eastern flora in no case passes through to the west, 
but in certain instances arrives there by other agencies, and finds congenial 
surroundings on secluded portions of elevations protected from the west. 

The absence of a high range extending along behind the coastal belt in 
Northern Australia is considered to largely account for the absence of rainfall 
in that locality during the winter months, and for the sparseness of the brush 
or jungle vegetation. 

The observations in regard to the effects of topography on the native flora 
indicate that the rainfall and climate in Eastern Australia are very largely 
regulated by the physiographic features, and the vegetation, after allowing 
for differences of soils, is chiefly the result of rainfall and climate. It would 
therefore appear that the removal of the forests would not result in a greatly 
reduced rainfall^ but would probably decrease the number of damp days.

lowed and the order uf precision attained, more detailed treatment being confined 
to three matters which are engaging attention at the present moment, viz., the 
general question of periodic errors of instrument graduation ; the relation 
between the height of an observed ray above gi'ound surface and the coefficient 
of refraction ; the third matter being a preliminary comparison of the geodetic 
with the astronomical latitudes, longitudes, and azimuth, for the purpose of 
estimating the relative forms of the surface covered by the survey and that of 
the assumed spheroid of revolution. 

The survey extends between latitudes 30° and 37° south and longitudes 
145° and 153° east, roughly including an area of 100,000 square miles. The 
fundamental object of the survey as a whole is to provide the positions of 
a series of points of sufficient accuracy to control the detail surveys made for 
the purposes of land alienation and administrative surveys generally and at the 
same time to facilitate map construction. Throughout the work, however, the 
necessity has been kept in view of observing certain chains of the triangulation 
with the greatest precision attainable not only so as to strengthen the remainder 
but to afford data for incorporation with other similar surveys in determining 
earth dimensions. It' is this primary triangulation which the paper deals with. 

Base lines have been measured at Lake George and at Richmond, and the 
Paper refers to the need for further bases of verification owing to the exten- 
sion of the survey. In preparation for measurement of these, invar tapes have 
been lately obtained and standardised and the site of one further base (nineteen 
miles in length) determined on. The angle work has till recently been observed 
with theodolites (Troughton &amp; Simms) of eighteen inches diameter read by 
four micrometers, but a 270-millimetre Repsold of the type used in the Geodetic 
Survey of South Africa has now been installed. For minor details of the 
methods of observing and reduction the Paper refers to one read by the writer 
in 1898 to the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science, the 
methods there described having been continued. It will suffice here to state 
that the mean closing errors of the 171 primary triangles is ± 0'/-70 and that 

^PP'ying Ferrero's criterion m = ( „ V the value of m is ascertained 

to be ±0/'-54, which indicates that the work is of a high order of precision. 

The purchase of the Repsold theodolite necessitated an examination of its 
circle errors which has resulted in a general discussion of such errors. This it 
is thought may be of interest and has already caused consideration to be given 
to the jjossible need for a change of observing routine. As already mentioned 
instruments read by four microscopes have hitherto been used. The Repsold is 
read by two microscopes. The mean reading of two opposite microscopes is 
alfected by periodic errors, Pi sin (£0fei) . . . .pr sin (2?-0 -)-£'•), fl being the circle 
reading. If after an arc ' Circle Left ' the telescope is turned over and swung 
through 180 degrees horizontally to prepare ' Circle Right ' the mean bearing 
of a signal derived from the combined observations will remain affected with 
these periodic errors. It is the practice on the survey to use five settings of the 
horizontal circle, each differing from the preceding by 36°. The new 
instrument has furnished results showing the large range of 4" amongst 
its bearings derived from the different settings. Although the means of bear- 
ings derived from the five settings are free from periodic error (other than those 

involving 100, 206, it has nevertheless been desired to determine 

accurate expressions for these errors for various reasons, and particularly with 
a view to estimating the accuracy of the graduation of the horizontal circle. 
An analysis shows how expressions for these errors may be determined from 
the observations of horizontal angles. From observations made at trigono- 
metrical station Rocks to 23 beacons the value -2"-19x sin (20-55°) has been 
derived for the first term, while from others at station Ovens to 17 beacons 
the value found is-2'/-ll sin (20- 53°). The terms containing 40 and 69 seem 
to have an amplitude of 0//-3 or 0//-2. Combining all the results yet available 
the correction to a microscope reading of the horizontal circle is, as far as 
has been determined, -17"-4 sin (0+lOl°)-2"-2 sin (20~54°)-l"-O sin (30-1-228°). 
. . . _ There is no suggestion in this series that the amplitude of the term 
containing 10 is of any importance, and it is highly probable that the five

Ill the ]&gt;aper already mentioned as having been read to the Australasian 
Association in 1S98 the writer referred to an apparent connection between the 
heights of the lines above the intervening surface and the values for the coeffi- 
cient of refraction derived from the reciprocally observed zenith distances. 
The extension of the survey since 1898 has given further data which generally 
bear out the conclusions then derived. These data and the results are dealt 
with in the present paper. In the absence of a topographical survey from 
which to ascertain the heiglit of each line above the intervening surface the 
observations have been grouped in the order of length of line, the assumption 
being that generally the longer lines are the higher. Another grouping has been 
made in which account has been taken of the height above sea-level on the 
assumption that the higher regions are the more hilly and that there the height 
of the ray above surface is the greater*. Both groupings woTild seem to indicate 
that where information as to the highest above surface is lacking varying 
coeftiiients of refraction may be assumed according to the lengths of the line.s 
observed. Diagrams are given showing the variations. 

The survey has been computed from the Sydney Observatory (Lat. 
33° 51' 41"-1 S. ; Long. 151° 12' 23//-1 E.) as origin. 'A map accompanying 
the Paper shows the extension of the survey therefrom southerly about 240 mile.s 
to the Victorian border, where it connects with the triangulation of Victoria, 
westerly about 360 miles to the limits of the almost flat country of the interior, 
and north-westerly towards the Queensland border a di-stance of 240 miles. 
The map .shows also the differences between the geodetic latitudes, longitudes, 
and azimuths as derived from the assumed earth dimensions (a modification of 
the Clarke 1880 spheroid) and the corresponding latitudes &amp;c. obtained by- 
astronomical observation. These show the effects of local deflection of the 
vertical caused by irregular distribution of surface-masses. Broadly, New South 
Wales may for our present purposes be said to be divisible into three zones, the 
littoral of from 20 to 60 miles in width rising from sea-level to 2,000 feet in 
height ; at the rear of that plateau 100 miles in width varying from 2,000 to 3.000 
feet in height, with mountain masses up to as much as (in the southern extremity) 
7,000 feet, and westward of that a more or less gentle western slope to interior 
plain country. As the result of the attraction of the central elevated mass and 
of the defect of gravity of the adjacent ocean it would appear that along the 
coast there is a general eastward deflection of the zenith of about 10" with a 
corresponding westward deflection on the western slopes ranging up to as much 
as 17", but gradually diminishing as the flat country is reached. In 1898 a 
general reduction of the data then available was made for the purjiose of obtain- 
ing an idea how far there was conformity between the actual surface and the 
assumed spheroid, but the survey was then too much limited to the eastern 
slopes to afford satisfactory evidence. With the subsecjuent extensions of the 
survey, however, a much more useful discussion of the subject is within reach, 
and it was hoped that by now bases of" verification on the outskirts of the work 
would have been measured, when it would have been possible to reduce the 
whole work with the object of enabling such a discussion to be made. 



2. The Saiid-Drifl Problem on ihe Eastern Coaat of Aii&lt;ifnilia. By 
G. PI. H.^Li.iGAN, F.G.S., Ivspecting Eughieer and Hydiogravhcr, 
N.S.W. 

The scientific, as well as the commercial, importance of a full knowledge 
of the direction, voliune, and velocity of the movement of sand on the eastern 
coast of this continent is sufficient warrant for the labour and cost expended 
upon it by the author during the last thirty years. 

There is undoubted evidence of the sinking of the eastern coast of Australia 
during recent geological time to the extent of 200 to 300 feet, and the natural 
result was to leave a very uneven shore-line, with many outlying islands, deep 
bays, and rocky capes. Had there been no ocean current, running parallel 
to the general trend of the shore, the sand and shingle, resulting from the 

G c 2 



452 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E. 

disintegration of the land by chemical, meteorological, and mechanical means 
would, of course, have been distributed by tides and waves, and would have 
formed sandy beaches in the immediate vicinity of their origin. The form of 
the beaches in the neighbourhood of granite, basalt, shale, or sandstone would 
have been readily recognisable; but such conditions do not exist, and the 
author endeavours to show that the resultant outlines could not assume the 
contour of the present shore-line, but are the natural consequence of a con- 
tinuous travel of beach material in one direction. 

The Eastern Australian current, which first strikes the Australian coast 
between Hervey Bay and Moreton Bay, has a velocity of from one to two 
knots, with very little seasonal variation. Some of the salient points on the 
coast tend to produce eddies, which have the effect of changing the outline of 
the sandy foreshore and diverting the course of the rivers, but, in the main, the 
direction of sand-movement below high water must, in consequence of this 
current, be from north to south. 

The effect of the travelling sand impinging upon the islands and reefs, and 
its accumulation in the form of banner-reefs, hooks, and tongues, &amp;c., .are 
described, and the result shown on the accompanying map. The map shows 
the boundary of the old rocky coast at the time the last subsidence of from 
200 to 300 feet took place, and its relation to the existing foreshore. The 
intervening space is partly or entirely filled with sand of marine origin, 
although covered in places with several feet of humus, which forms some of 
the richest land of our coastal area. 

On certain jiarts of the coast the sandy beaches take the form of the Greek 
letter ' Zeta," the resemblance becoming less as the speed of the current 
decreases. 

The significance of this ' Zeta ' curve, in its relation to harbour engineering, 
has been referred to by the author in another paper, as also the necessity for 
differentiation between ocean and tidal currents as they affect sand-movement at 
river and harbour entrances. 

The volume of sand travelling down the coast has been computed from 
measurements made at the Clarence River entrance and at Port Kembla, and 
tlie effect of varying weather conditions upon the movement is referred to. 

Some measurements of the sizes of the sand grains and their geological 
origin are given, for the purjiose of supjilying data for comparison witli similar 
areas in other parts of the world. 



3. Central Avslrulia (Uhl ils Pos.sihilHirs. Btj W. H. Tietkens. 

That part of Australia to which reference was made lies for the most part 
between the parallels of 24 deg. 20 niin. and 30 deg. 35 min. South Latitude, and 
between 123 deg. and 133 deg. East Longitude, embracing an area of about 
378,000 square miles, considerably greater tlian the area of New South Wales. 
This immense area may be described as a sandy depression, in places perhaps 
not much above sea-level, where the sand-hills or sand-dunes in some instances 
may be 100 feet high, and it has been called the 'Dead Heart of Australia.' 

So much has been done in reclaiming these so-called desert tracts in other 
countries that it would be well to turn our attention to the enormous area at 
our door. These sand-hills occur in confused groupings, also in nearly parallel 
ridges, but these will not be found to prevail west of 127 deg. East Longitude. 
Welt of that meridian, with few exceptions, the country is more level — soil firm 
and hard loam, nodules of iron-stained gravel, robust vegetation, spinifex, 
mulga, desert oak, and other Casuarina. The object is to point out from 
personal knowledge where such schemes of irrigation can be best effected, and 
which if carried out, will in time develop and make profitable that which has 
hitherto been regarded as a desert waste. 

Possibilities are suggested from the fact that native wells are sometimes the 
remains of mound springs. These springs, we learn, are the natural outlet of 
artesian waters, and from that it would seem that the artesian basin may here 
be nearer the surface than has hitherto been observed in Australia.

/■'I/I DAY, AUGUST 14. 

The President deli\ eied tlie following Address :— 

The subject wliich 1 wish to discuss to-day has been determined for me by tlie 
circumstances of the present meeting of the British Association and by the trend 
of modern economic study and research. We are meeting for the first time here 
gathered together from distant and diverse parts of the world, and in this 
Section at any rate we shall be discussing problems similar in certain respects in 
our various countries but unlike in other respects owing to the differences between 
those countries. It is a fortunate circumstance, because it is largely by means of 
an interchange of views and experience acquired in such different environments 
that true knowledge can be surely attained. On the other hand, it can be said, I 
think, without any exaggeration that of the economic studies of the last twenty 
years none have been more fruitful in result than those which have dealt witli 
economic development as it has taken place in the past and as it is taking ))lacc 
in the present. Economic laws, which, after all, are but generalisations of the 
relations between different factors or of the relations which exist between 
certain causes and certain consequences, are studied increasingly in connection 
with particular periods, movements, and countries. New forces and new 
features present themselves, and with their introduction we perceive a change in 
results. This at once teaches the relativity of many economic maxims and 
statements and disproves the assumption, which at times some have been prone 
to make, that all nations and all countries undergo a luiiform process of develop- 
ment and respond in a uniform way to any given action or policy. ]t throws 
some light, too, upon the nature of these laws. Economic laws are not invali- 
dated because conclusions alter as premises alter. But, on the other hand, such 
changes necessarily bring with them alterations in the rules laid down for 
practical guidance. 

We come then to consider the particular economic features which characterise 
countries passing through the early stages of economic evolution during modern 
or recent times. Such countries, it need hardly be said, stand in a marked con- 
trast to the older countries which surround and confront them and which have 
all already passed into further and more advanced stages. They differ also in 
their economic circumstances — and this is what needs special emphasis — from 
those same countries when in the primary stage of growth in the past. 

But to bring the matter within the limits of an address it is necessary at the 
very outset to define a little carefully the scope of the investigation. New 
countries differ greatly among themselves. Speaking broadly, they fall into three 
chief groups. There are tropical countries unfitted for white settlement and 
marked out by their characteristics for a very specialised development. Again, 
there are countries like some of the States of South America where, owing to 
]iarticular features attending settlement, or to climatic and other ciiuscs, a 
growth at all comparable to that which has taken place in Western Europe is 



454 TRANSACTIONS Of SECTION F. 

retarded if ever practicable. Lastly, we come to lands like Canada and Australia, 
and with these may be included the United States, where considerable similarity 
to the older countries exists alike in antecedents, circumstances, and prospects, 
though in each case there are undoubted and specific economic differences.' 1 
purpose, therefore, while not wholly excluding from our survey countries of the 
two former types, to direct your attention in the main to the last-mentioned type, 
in the hope that by an examination so defined, and a contrast of countries of 
this order with the old European nations, some light may be thrown on the 
causes underlying the more striking dissimilarities in development. 

Before, however, the economic features and differences distinctive of new 
countries are dealt with, it may be well to say a word or two as to the general 
course of early economic growth in England and other European coimtries. 
Three features call for particular mention. In their early stages these latter 
countries were free from any continuous external contact and interference ; their 
relations with eadr other and the outer world were slight, or at any rate not 
such as to fundamentally determine the direction and nature of their develop- 
ment ; they had to meet their own wants and to do this by means of their own 
resources. Secondly, during this period the nation itself was composed of small 
and almost self-subsistent and self-contained groups. Lastly, economic methods, 
social ties, and intellectual attainments were on the same plane, being simple 
and, as we now should say, backward or primitive. 

When we turn, however, to the position of new or young countries either at 
the present day or during recent years, we are met at once by features which 
stand out in significant contrast to those sketched above. Not only are such 
countries in the early period of evolution, but they are in continuous contact with 
other countries, and, moreover, with other countries which are in a very different 
stage of development. Again, they are young countries, in some instances 
inhabited largely or wholly by people, in other cases guided and controlled by 
leaders, modern in every respect and sharing to the full in the science, know- 
ledge, and ideas dominating the older countries. Furthermore, both their social 
and their political features are modern ; on the one hand, these are not of the 
type which in the past were associated with the early stage of growth; on the 
other hand, the countries themselves are much less affected than are older 
countries at the present day by traditions and customs which, despite their origin 
in the circumstances of bygone days, still continue to influence the life of the 
present. In other words, they are less helped or less hindered by habits of long 
formation. But these somewhat general considerations are but preliminary to a 
closer and more careful analysis of the particular economic conditions which beset 
countries now in the early years of growth. 

Firstly, such countries, even in the earliest stage, are unavoidably in close 
relations with countries which have attained a more elaborate growth and 
organisation : communication renders isolation impracticable, and every year the 
means of communication increase. It is a question, not of intentional interfer- 
ence, but of that inevitable influence which nations in close relations bring to bear 
upon each otlier. Nor is it a question of one-sided influence. Older nations 
have been and are affected in their economic policy and organisation by the 
discovery and opening up of new lands and by the events taking place in "them. 
Still, it is probable that the influence of the older-established world is more 
powerful, so far at any rate as the direction of economic jjrogress is concerned. 
Be this, however, as it may, it is tliis aspect which occupies our attention at the 
present moment. The effect is particularly apparent in trade and industry. 
Needs, in other words, are not dependent for their specific satisfaction on the 
internal resources and productive activities of the particular land, and this, 
while important in all instances, is of great moment in the case of a country 
which, as yet without opportunity to develop its powers, is seeking, as it were 
tentatively, the best lines of advance. It is peculiarly open to influences of this 
kind, because its organisation is not firmly established. When the social struc- 
ture is less complete and the direction of development uncertain, the risk of 
future and permanent advantages being outweighed by present gain is enhanced. 

Secondly, in the opening up of resources, the former dependence on tlie 
internal powers of tlie country has been essentially modified. Both capital and 
labour can be obtained from outside. This, of course, quickens develojiment ; 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 455 

but at tlie same time it may affect its direction. Certainly it introduces many 
fresh problems; and sometimes these are very difficult problems. Taken aa a 
whole, it leads to a very rapid or sudden development, an aspect of peculiar 
importance where what we call native races are concerned. Quite apart from 
certain evils often associated with such alien intrusion or dominance, and apart 
too from the shock occasioned by the introduction of foreign standards and 
customs alongside of or in substitution for old usages, such people often have 
manifested an inability to stand the mere pace of modern progress. Even when 
we come to white races, the results of the rapid progress which occurs when 
natural resources are rich are open to adverse criticism. Again, it may lead to 
too great a concentration on particular methods of production and particular 
occupations, to the exclusion it may be of other methods and occupations w'hich 
ultimately may be more advantageous. Again, stable customs and social ties 
are more difficult to form when industrial development is hurried. In addition 
to these, other special difficulties manifest themselves in the respective cases 
of alien capital and alien labour in new countries. So far as capital is concerned, 
the case varies according as the introduction of foreign capital is or is not accom- 
panied by the introduction of those who control the employment of the capital, 
and so the indu.stries in which such capital is used. Even when alone an interest 
on the part of outside nations is often awakened which is not wholly healthy, 
extending sometimes to attempted political influence, though this, it should 
be said, is not of frequent occurrence except in the case of countries largely 
native or semi-native or occupying a very backward position in the scale of 
civilisation. Sometimes, too, it may occasion the premature exhaustion of 
jiai'ticular sources of wealth, or at any rate rather in the interests of foreign 
capitalists than of the inhabitants themselves. But in the case of the more 
backward countries, and especially of countries where climatic conditions precUule 
a white population occupied in manual work, it has usually meant the intro- 
duction of a class, controlling cajiital and organising industry, and .yet entirely 
alien to the main body of inhabitants. fSuch a situation undoubtedly imjioses 
a great responsibility on those in whose hands lies the social and political govern- 
ment of the country, a responsibility still greater when the organising class 
does not settle down, but comes and goes in a bewildering proces- 
sion. Britisli India and the Dutch Indies furnish illustrations; and, to some 
extent, the effect of such a tendency is to be perceived in certain parts of South 
America. Nor is the immigration of labour from other countries less complex 
or less potent in its results. Such labour conies from many sources and varies 
greatly in kind. A clear distinction, however, must be drawn between white 
labour not essentially different from the existing white population and 
more or less skilled or otherwise adapted to good manual work, and, on the other 
liand, labour of a lower typo, often racially distinct and in some cases brought in 
owing to its climatic suitability. So far as the former is concerned, immigration 
as a rule is attended with few difficulties other than those of a simple economic 
character and more or less temporaiy in their nature. A ready means of stimu- 
lating industrial development is provided, and the country is supplied with 
skilled adults without the cost of education and upbringing. But the results of 
immigration of the second type of labour are less simple. The general question 
of immigration, indeed, may be looked at from three points of view. From 
the aspect of economic employment, immigration often involves immediate com- 
petition with the labour already in the country or coming forward with the 
normal increase in the population. But in a new and progressive country with 
many openings for new developments sucli competition is seldom liarmful. In 
the long run the labour creates its own field of employment and contributes 
towards the general progress. At times, it is true, the su]iply may be in excess of 
the demand, and any particular kind of labour may continue to stream in long 
after the need for it has ceased. But this can be remedied best by the wider 
diffusion of accurate knowledge as to the conditions and necessities of the place 
in question. Positive restriction, if attempted, may do harm by Obstructing 
supplies of labour when needed in the future. When, however, economic 
standards of hvmg are considered, the kind or type of labour in question is all- 
important. Ordinary white labour entering a counti-v already peopled with white 
men offers little difficulty. But nearly all nations have encountered difficulties • 



450 TRANSACTIONS OF SKOTION P. 

wlien any considerable immigration of labour occurs from countries where the 
standard of living is essentially and, as it were, permanently lower, and these are 
rendered graver when accentuated by difference of race. In old and new 
countries alike the entry of a low type of foreign white labour may bring about a 
lowering of the general standard in certain industries or certain places, with 
harm, not necessarily limited to the district or employment in which it settles. 
Still, apart from the more general considerations of policy, interference would 
probably involve restriction of the more desirable type of labour already dealt 
with and thus be economically disadvantageous. The case of coloured labour 
is admittedly different even dn this respect. Standards vary and the racial 
barrier seems to prevent their speedy adjustment. But the difficulties of the 
whole matter are shown more clearly if we turn to consider immigration in its 
relation to general social progress and political government. Here the main 
point is the possibility of assimilation. How far or how easilv, it is asked, can 
such new elements be absorbed into the general life and made an integral part of 
a homogeneous population ? N'ow, it is not my business to discuss the question 
in detail, still less to examine any particular policy which may be advocated or 
which may have been adopted. All that is necessary is to note"this difficulty and 
to emphasise its existence in the case of new countries and especially of 'those 
countries or places where labour of this type is required or attracted by reason of 
climate or other like causes. Two considerations may come into sharp conflict : 
on the one hand, the rapid production of wealth may be assisted; on the other 
liand, serious effects in respect of economic progress, nationality, and orderly 
growth may be experienced. 

In no country, it should be added, has the question of the supply of labour 
from outside played a more important part in economic liistory than in 
Australia. During the early period not only was it one of the influences which 
tended to the continuance of the tran.sportation system, but it was. if not the 
chief, one of the two chief factors in the policy of colonisation and settlement 
devised and advocated by that very distinguished man, Edward Gibbon 
Wakefield. In more recent years it has been associated with state assistance, 
and also with forms of indentured labour. And it remains one of the problems 
before the country. 

Thirdly, modern methods and modern science are applied to production even 
in its early phases, to agriculture and the extractive industries as well as in 
trade and manufacture. The consequences are both many and great. Rapid 
and sudden growth is rendered possible, but this, as already indicated, results 
in consequences not always or wholly advantageous. Such effects are the more 
evident when the natural resources of the country are rich. Furthermore, when 
such occurs there is an invariable tendency to substitute large-scale systems of 
Ijroduction for the smallscale systems characteristic of production in the past 
when in an early stage, and this is not without significance both economic and 
political. No doubt this is of greater moment when a development of this 
order takes place in a land peopled by native races, who are forced, as it were, 
into a system wholly alien to their social surroundings, and one which they fail 
to understand. There is a disastrous incongruity between their method of 
employment and their social environment. Though of less it is still of some 
importance when the population itself is modern in civilisation and outlook. 
To some extent, but only partially, they inherit from their ancestors in other 
lands the lessons slowly acquired in the time of small industry and occupatioTi. 
On the other hand, there can be no doubt that the more rapid progress due to 
the reasons given, accompanied as it is by greater vicis.situdes, offers a more 
general opportunity of success to those willing to work hard than is possible in 
other countries. Rapid progress always tends towards this end, and it does so 
tlie moie especially when the organisation is more flexible and less marked by 
custom. Not only is the field itself wider, but the changes in the field are more 
frequent. 

The difference in economic development, thus briefly depicted, implies, it 
must be remembered, a somewhat parallel difference in administrative and 
political life. If we take such a country as England, small-scale production 
was part and parcel of a system in which small local communities grew up 
practically self-contained and self governed. Thu.s the strength of the Govern- 
ment rested largely on local administration which made its influence felt in tiie 



PRRSIDRNTIAL ADnRRSS. 157 

general and central administration. But in a young country developing under 
modern conditions the system of local administration is consciously devised. 
It rather derives its existence from the central Government than furnishes the 
material out of which this latter is gradually evolved. 

Fourthly, a modern new country has before it the example of older countries 
which, after passing through the phase in which it is, have developed the more 
complex economic system towards which it is tending. Their conditions and 
institutions record the results of forces which, though nascent in it, are 
yet in operation. It may have something to imitate, it certainly will see much 
to avoid. This is true from many points of view. It is true in a technical 
sense. Everyone knows the importance of rutlilessly scrapping plant; but there 
are parts of the national plant, as it were, which' cannot be scrapped. Though 
neither the English railways nor the English canals if laid out anew would be 
constructed on their present lines, they are too elaborate and costly to be 
destroyed and reconstructed. It is equally, if not more, true when we consider 
the industrial system in its more general aspects. In this instance we know that 
Germany, to take an instance, enjoyed one advantage because her development 
followed, and was not contemporary with, industrial development in England. 
Perhaps it is truest' of all in respect of the social consequences of industrial 
development. Take, for example, the large cities and manufacturing districts 
in the old countries with all their social problems; housing, sanitary, and 
social. A country in the early stages is in this truly advantageous position 
that action in its case means prevision and not reform. Hence the crucial 
importance at the joresent time, in such a country as this, of the Town Planning 
movement. Again, there has occurred, in those lands in which manufacture 
has made its greatest strides, a gradual exodus from the rural districts, partly 
no doubt because of the larger wages to be obtained in the towns and industrial 
districts, but partly owing to a past, if not present, disregard of agricultural 
interests, and to the comparative lack of attraction in the country. It may be 
looking ahead to suggest that such may affect a country like Australia ; but 
time brings many changes. In any case the time to provide against a movement 
such as this is not when it lias acquired force, but when agriculture is pros- 
perous and before town life has begun to exert its curious lure on the 
population. 

Fifthlv, older nations became critical and self-conscious at a comparatively 
late stage in their history; that is, after customs had been formed and structure 
had lost its former flexibility. In such cases remedial movements and changes, 
however wisely initiated, encounter a natural and quite comprehensible conser- 
vative opposition. Whatever their possible gain, in the progress towards this 
destruction is involved. Nor is it incorrect to conclude that in many instances 
the immediate and certain losses riglitly outweigh the problematic if ultimate 
advantages. Far otherwise is the case in a new country where the period of self- 
consciousness begins with the early days of growth, and conscious action towards 
a given goal has an easier path and suffers less from the knowledge that it 
must destroy in order to achieve. Even if social experiments fail, in such 
countries they cost less than they would in countries more stable and more 
firmly based in habit and tradition. Of course, there is loss as well as gain in 
this. In the one type of country there is greater stability, in the other greater 
confidence or courage in novel directions. 

Lastly, and following to some measure on what has just been said, we have 
to take into account the smaller part played by social conventions in the 
economic life of new countries. In older countries, primary development took 
place under conditions as to social life and order not due wholly to economic 
causes, but often arising from reasons which existed outside that domain. Social 
position, accepted without question, and forces like caste, rather indicated what 
various classes were to do than grew out of the necessities or nature of their 
respective occupations. No doubt .some correspondence was required, since 
regulations unsnited to progress led to the supersession of the races less apt to 
meet the needs of the time, and so the usages which survived bore the stamp 
of economic fitness. Still, in the main, economic activities rather followed than 
created class divisions. But the economic situation changed, and thus in later 
years we have the curious spectacle of distinctions which have survived from 
the p.ist and with time lost inm h of their nieaiiiiig, lingering on side hv side 



458 TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION F. 

with class distinctions resting wholly on economic success. In a new country 
not only are traditions weaker, but from the beginning economic success plays 
a larger part. Thus, social prejudices as to the standing or respectability of 
varying occupations are less strong. Again, owing in part to circumstances of 
this order, work of some kind is to a larger extent the normal lot of all, a 
feature which cannot but play a great part in the development of the country. 
The existence of even a small idle class is anomalous. On the other hand, there 
is the inevitable drawback that material success, or, to put the matter bluntly, 
wealth, has less to counterbalance it than in lands where traditional position 
still holds a place. It is quite true that in England the same or a like tendency 
has been marked in recent years. No doubt, too, this danger, and it is a very 
real danger, is best met by the erection of finer ideals and loftier standards of 
conduct and attainment than are furnished by considerations of birth and 
traditional position ; but meantime, and pending their growth, the latter, at any 
rate in old countries, does something to lessen the importance and influence 
attached to wealth as a thing in itself. Even in new lands, such as tlie United 
States, and no doubt to some extent in Australia, they are not without a ceitain 
influence, but they are in an alien atmosphere. Hence the particular imjiortance 
of the creation of a real standard of culture and jiersonal excellence. 

Hitherto it has been my task to state and describe the chief economic 
particulars with regard to which countries of various types differ. It is now 
necessary to examine these in other ways and especially as to the influence 
which taken together they exert upon the economic progress of what we have 
called new countries. To do this at all fruitfully necessitates their consideration 
with regard to three matter.? — namely, the direction of economic development, 
ihe industrial organisation, and, lastly, the national life and character. 

The first question to put. then, is the special effect of these factors upon the 
economic occupations and interests of such countries. The natural answer wliicli 
will occur to any economist is that countries in close contact and engaged in 
trade tend to develop those industries and occupations in which, as compared with 
others, they enjoy special advantages or stand at the least disadvantage. Such a 
distinction or "division of industries, of course, exists between foreign nations 
and is the basis of the theory of international trade. But in the case of young 
countries its features and consequences are accentuated and bear a particular 
significance : with them it means that almost inevitably and before manu- 
factures have been initiated, let alone developed, they will enter upon a course 
complementary, as it were, to the occuisations embraced in older countries and 
cori'esponding to the needs of such countrie.s^ the direction of their growth 
being determined by the interaction of external needs and their own natural 
wealth. This is in the main the so-called ' infant industries ' argument; but it 
is important to observe in detail the many can.ses which make up the strength 
of tliis when applied to the case of young indu.';tries in a new country. The 
circumstances of such countries usually offer peculiar advaiitages in some one or 
other branch of agriculture, sometimes, too, in mining. If the case of agri- 
culture be taken, such countries possess, as compared with older countries, 
abundance of land in proportion to population, while in addition the soil is 
new and often rich. The truth of this may be seen by a reference to Australia, 
Canada, the United States, Chile, and the Argentine. In all these, the agri- 
cultural advantages, and in some those connected with mining, are great. 
(Consequently foreign capital is attracted into these directions and suitable 
foreign labour is needed and obtained. Sometimes in the case of settlers the two 
come together. The great strength of agriculture in these instances lies in the 
apiilication of modern scientific methods of farming and the use of machinery 
where land is plentiful. On the other hand, new countries are unfavourably 
situated for the prosecution of manufacture. Not only would they encounter 
the competition of manufactures already long established, highly organised, 
and victorious over the initial difficulties involved in such a development, but 
the}' are lacking in two great requisites. They lack a population trained to 
manufacture and with some degree of that acquired skill which is 
attained from an industrial environment. Further, manufactures depend to a 
great extent on the degree of general organisation in the countrj' as a whole, 
which includes, not merely skill, but the development of those conditions and 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 459 

means which are necessary to highly skilled iudustiies, providing it with ready 
carriage, organised markets, and credit. Such a sj'stem is only evolved slowly, 
and in its absence, or while it is we^k, the struggle for success is necessarily 
severe. Under such circumstances the line of least resistance is obvious and 
the forces of individual action and of competition drive a new country 
into this direction. At this date it is fortunately necessary to deal only with 
the normal forces which bring about what has been called a complementary 
development in new countries. Still, it must be remembered that from time 
to time suggestions have been made which are, to say the least, reminiscent of 
the ideas underlying the old ' colonial system,' which sought by political 
measures to compel colonies to develop along these lines, that is, so far as the 
circumstances of the time in respect of locomotion and carriage allowed. 

The errors of the old ' colonial ' policy may seem evident to us, but if so, it 
is because they were emphasised in its disastrous consequences. 

When scientific colonisation came into debate, with the nineteenth century, 
there was no thought of attempting any revival of the system just alluded to. 
On the contrary, one of the first subjects to attract attention was the possible 
undesirability of too one-sided a development. This was looking at the matter 
from the point of view of the new country itself. To some writers greater 
variety of occupation appeared advantageous, and with this end in view schemes 
were propounded for the establishment of town-settlements and other forms of 
industrial development. 

Both old and new countries may be said to suffer under disadvantages in this 
respect, but the disadvantages point in different directions. The maintenance 
and extension of rui'al life is demanded in England, for instance, whereas in new 
lands the demand has been expressed for the encouragement of manufacture. 
Alike from the economic as from the more general point of view, the development 
side by side of activities so different in their direction, and so admirably fitted to 
supplement each other in their influence on national life, may seem desirable. 
In a community, as in an individual, many elements are required, and these, 
it may be contended, can be permanently secured only by a variety of occupations 
and interests. Though this is a matter for argument, here it is sufficient to 
observe that the question exists and that with it is raised the advisability or 
inadvisability of state action to prevent too great a concentration in one direc- 
tion and to foster other occupations which, however great their success may 
be when well established, have little or no chance of surmounting the difficulties 
attending them in the earlier stages. 

When we turn to industrial organisation and especially to the question of 
the relations of labour and capital, certain matters may be briefly mentioned 
and then dismissed. In some new countries foreign capitalistic interests pre- 
dominate and introduce difficulties partly economic and partly political in 
character. Again, the entry of low-grade labour and particularly of coloured 
labour creates the peculiar dangers which attend a rigid and especially a racial 
separation between different economic classes. Here again the problems are 
partly economic and partly political. But these, though undoubtedly grave 
matters, are somewhat special and by no means universal in new countries. 
It is more important, then, to consider how far the general problem of the 
relations between capital and labour is likely to be affected by the particular 
characteristics which have passed under review. 

A greater emphasis on the rights and claims of labour is only to be expected, 
and is due to varioiis causes. Certain of these are particularly important. 
There is a smaller body of labour in a position of personal dependence, a factor 
greatly accentuated by the opportunities of change which present themselves. 
So there is a greater independence of attitude. Again, work and economic 
occupation play a very large part in the general life of the country. When 
such is the case, public attention, and so general interest, are attracted to the 
conditions and the remuneration of labour. This attitude should be carefully 
distinguished from that due to the human sympathies awakened by the spectacle 
of distress and misery. It shows itself less in attempts to alleviate personal 
suffering and more in the determination to secure for labour what is considered 
to be its rightful position. Justice rather than mercy is its characteristic. 
On the other side, there is no great mass of inherited traditions. It was 



4G0 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F. 

exj)lained before that social or class traditions are derived, at any rate in 
part, from a time when position was due less to economic reasons than to 
causes inherent in the structure of society. These remain on in a changed 
ecanomic environment, with the lesult that certain grades in the economic 
hierarchy tend to become the partial monopoly of particular classes. Hence 
a separation and a tacit opposition between certain classes with their economic 
development and other classes. Countries which have escaped the earlier stage 
are less affected by considerations of this kind. Furthermore, the present 
industrial condition of older nations is not without effect as an example. The 
public evils of low-paid labour brought up in bad surroundings are an illustra- 
tion of what is to be avoided. It is correctly seen that it is easier to anticijjate 
such conser|uences by avoiding the conditions which lead to them than to 
remedy them when produced. 

There is another circumstance which, though by no means universal in new 
countries, tends in the same direction. The effect of different systems of land- 
ownership and occupation upon the jjosition of labour calls for attention in 
countries of all descriptions. Speaking generally, it may be said that free 
access to the land and the existence of small ownership, or to a less degree 
of other means of small cultivation, add to the freedom and increase the 
independence of those employed, not only on the land but in all occupations. 
In this respect there is no doubt much difference between countries of the kind 
under discussion. Still, on the whole, the greater abundance of land as com- 
joared with population and the recentness of land legislation offer in such 
countries a wider and a better alternative to industrial and other wage-paid 
employments than exists in several of the older and more settled nations, and 
hence increases the independence of the classes concerned. 

On the other hand, certain of the circumstances which give strength to this 
movement on the part of labour affect in a marked way its nature and its 
course. Better op])ortunity and less rigid separation between industrial classes 
will bring with them in the long run a sound appreciation of the many and 
vaiious factors which combine in economic development. The tardy rise into 
jnominence and power of the labour movement at a late date in the develop- 
ment of old nations involves one very real danger which new countries have, 
at any rate, the ojiportunity of escaping. With the existence of a marked 
separation between the various industrial classes, attended as that is by features 
of distress and less relieved than in new countries by equality of opportunity, 
it is difticult to secure an equable and unembittered consideration of the economic 
importance either of capital or of the .skill which directs, controls, ventures, 
and organises. The hardships and inequalities obvious in the system, when 
coupled with the long existence and apparent permanence of the industries, lead 
not unnaturally to an under-estimate of these as factors and to a keen feeling 
that the one thing necessary is a new distribution of the national wealth. 
In these respects new countries have initial advantages. Their greater vigour 
begets a ]iride in the progress of the community and in the industries and occu- 
pations which embody and signalise that progress ; while more widespread oppor- 
tunity, and the sense of being at the beginning of things, should make them 
conscious that it is their task to devise a system both equable and commercially 
progressive. Still it is one thing to have an opportunity and another to utilise 
it well. 

There are, it is true, certain circumstances which for a time may obscure 
or even hold in abeyance this very necessary endeavour. When rich resources 
are being rapidly opened up and when prosperous undertakings press one upon 
another, people are too busy and too well-off to pay attention to economic 
problems, despite the future importance of their solution. The return to the 
various factors, both capital and labour, is nigh, and there is little complaint 
as to lack of opportunity. It is largely due to this that, even amongst new 
countries, the part played by the forces of labour, and the claims made on its 
behalf, vary so much. Again, no doubt, the political machinery has a great 
influence. A country where the jnofessional politician rules, or where the 
caucus exerts its sway, is little likely to develoj) a sane and well-timed industrial 
policy. 

The effect of economic conditions on national life and standards i.s a subject 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. Kil 

wliirh merits iihrIi attention, hut here 1 must confine myself to distinguishing 
certain results or particular economic features which characterise one type of 
country. Some of these, indeed, despite their importance, must be treated 
very briefly. Thus, for instance, the effect of a rather one-sided economic 
development, already treated of in another connection, has a bearing on the 
present matter. Again, the difficulties which some new countries have experi- 
enced, in respect of the immigration of a particular type of labour, are 
undoubtedly attended by social and political risks. No nation can view with 
equanimity the steady increase of an element in the population which stands 
out apart and distinct from the nation and can neither assimilate national 
characteristics nor be absoi'bed into the national life. Remedy may be difficult, 
but such a situation is undoubtedly disquieting. But if we leave these, as 
matters already dealt with, there are four matters which call for attention. In 
the first place, the circumstances of a new country, if that country be at all 
jirosperous, naturally engender self-reliance and vigour. The openness of out- 
look, and the obviousness of the progress achieved, make for assurance and 
hopefulness. Even if vicissitudes be frequent, and men lose as well as gain 
and fall as well as rise, we only come to- Adam Smith's position when he attri- 
buted the stimulating effect of great prizes in any occupation or calling to the 
innate sanguineness of human nature, which leads each man to believe in his 
own prospects of success, whatever may be the fate of average mankind. And 
where the examples of success are many, this individual hopefulness is much 
.strengthened. So, too, the greater diffusion of opportunity plays a part. 
What is characteristic of the individual is characteristic of the race. Of course, 
there are some new countries where a lack of rich resources precludes any such 
feeling, and in any country there must occur from time to time periods of 
depression, perhaps the more acute because of their vivid contrast with the 
sanguine past. But, taken as a whole, undoubtedly in new countries, where 
development is in active progress, there is greater vigour, greater assurance, 
perhaps greater self-assertion, than in other lands where development has gone 
fuither and where the prospect lying before the race as well as the individual 
is bounded by what seems to be a nearer and a more defined horizon. In the 
.second place, as work is the common lot, there is less division between calling 
and calling and more tendent'y to judge a man by what he has done in his 
occupation, whatever that may be. A factor like this is far-reaching in its 
influence and reveals itself in many directions. It makes for solidarity, as well 
by creating a community of interest as by destroying prejudices. It furnishes 
a common test whereby pretensions and claims for consideration can be tried ; 
and, though the measure may be imperfect, the test of actuality, after all, has 
the merit of being definite. In the third place, in such communities material 
things and material interests necessarily loom large. This points to a weak 
feature in this )ihase of development which is emphasised by the 
circumstances of a country striving to make good its place amongst older 
nations. The very pressure of their demands and their competition add to its 
pi'ominence. Success means material prosperity. There can be little doubt 
that this is one of the dangers against which a community of this type has to 
stiive. Such a country is, by the very nature of things, face to face with 
material difficulties and its victory rests on material achievements. Even 
the democratic test, alluded to above, of actual work and achievement 
operates in the same direction. In the last jDlace, the very freedom from 
class prejudice is in part due to a general absence of custom and tradi- 
tion which has an unfavourable as well as a favourable side. From a social 
point of view, custom is an invaluable tie, welding into union a large 
body of individuals with every variety of aim and very different views and 
opinions. It gives a permanence and stability to social life. No doubt, each 
coimtry has to form its own habits, but till these are formed the social 
structure is weak. As an illustration, a comparison may be made between 
legislation in a new and in an old country. In the latter, legislation is largely 
a gradual development of cnstom, and as a consequence the course of legisla- 
tion is slow, often injuriously slow ; the delay in some case.T being due to an 
unfair regard for vested rights ; but the main reason is the latent dislike to 
any violent breach with the past and to departures from custom. On the other 



463 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F. 

linnd, legislation in n, new country is mnrli more roni=!eious. Not only are 
tlieie fewer customary bonds, but there is less regard for those which there 
are. I do not wish to pronoiince any opinion as to the net advantages of one 
method or the other. The point to be emphasised is the existence of a 
difference in this as in many other respects. 

To what, it may be asked, does the examination summarised under the fore- 
going headings point ? In the first place, it gives some grounds for and explains 
the nature of public action as it has manifested itself in these countries. Now, 
an active state policy in social and economic matters may be due to many 
reasons. It may arise from an imperfect individual development, or, again, 
from what seems at first sight nearly the same thing but is really quite different 
— the existence of a highly organised and peculiarly efficient bureaucracy. But 
neither of these is true of the principal countries under consideration ; in the 
United States, Canada, and Australasia, individuality is a very vital force, and 
the tendency of government cannot be termed unduly bureaucratic. The latter 
point may be illustrated by a comparison with modern Germany, which has been 
influenced so greatly by the system of bureaucratic administration built up by 
Stein and his successors. Of course, good officials can always achieve a great 
deal, but it is one thing to use officials and the official system as instruments 
to give effect to a policy, and another to take a policy from them. It must not 
be supposed, however, that democratic countries are altogether free from this 
latter danger. They arc liable to it, unless means be adopted to keep the people 
as a whole in immediate contact with problems of government and to give them 
opportunities of co-operating in some way or other in public administration. 
But to return to the main point. State activity in these countries seems to me 
due to quite other causes; on the one hand, the occasions for it are more 
numerous and the opportunities for it great; on the other hand, not only is there 
a natural predisposition in its favour, but many of the objections present in 
older countries are absent. But both these matters require explanation. With 
regard to the occasions for state action, economists, differ though they may on 
the question of its abstract desirability, will agree, I imagine, that in propor- 
tion as these are multiplied the tendency towards such action will increase. If 
we turn to what has already been said, it is clear beyond doubt that an unusual 
opening for such action is afforded in the circumstances enumerated. Thus the 
case of young industries in a new country has been admitted fairly generally to 
afford an argument for protection specifically different from those adduced in 
otlier instances. It is not merely the case of young industries, but, to repeat my 
words, of young industries in a new country. Again, the regulation of immi- 
gration is presented in a very particular form. Whatever may be thought of 
any particular policy of restriction — and everyone is aware that there are many 
and varying considerations to take into account — a country deriving a large 
part of its labour-supply from outside will naturally claim to exercise a super- 
vision over the nature of that supply not less than it exerts by education and 
other means over the labour supplied and trained within its confines. Again, 
in a country developing its resources and its latent natural wealth, and under 
considerable and inevitable pressure to move rapidly, a large field for State 
action opens out. But in addition State action in the circumstances of a new 
country is advantageously placed, inasmuch as it takes place early, when there 
is little to upset, and when action of any kind and by any body is most likely 
to achieve really tangible results. In other words, not only are the occasions 
many, but the opportunity for effective action is favourable. Furthermore, the 
exploitation of resources, "hitherto untouched, by modern and scientific methods 
puts a powerful instrument at the disposal of the C4overnment which was wholly 
wanting in former days, while, on the other hand, the knowledge of the results 
which have ensued in other lands from uncontrolled individual competition indi- 
cates the direction which action should take. To this are due the attempts 
made in some, at least, of these countries to rcigulate the relations of capital 
and labour. Certainly, in matters of this kind, those communities hjive initial 
advantages, when measures are undertaken in a comparatively early stage of 
growth — before, that is, industries have assumed the intricate form usual in 
old lands. Nor does this exhaust the situation. A new country is inclined to 
novel methods of action, as is shown by the general favour with which fresh 
expedients are received. While a tendency like this is due in part to the innate 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 463 

vigour of the people themselves, there are other causes which lend it strength : 
ill tlie present instance, there is, on the one hand, tlie feeling that they can 
afford the experiment; on the other, the resolve to avoid, though the cost may 
be considerable and the risk great, the difficulties and dangers with which older 
nations are confronted. Even if the whole course is not clear, they would fain 
steer clear of the rocks and shoals which are charted. 

Influences like these imply experimental legislation. Now, in a sense, most 
economic legislation is experimental; unforeseen results occur, and alteration, 
amendment, or repeal is required ; but the extent to which it is experimental is 
certainly greater when we turn from the record of the past to the recent efforts 
of new communities. Reasons for this have been adduced, which may be briefly 
summarised, though in a somewhat different form. As compared with con- 
temporary nations of a more complex type, new nations are more prone to 
engage in experimental legislation for three reasons : firstly, because things are 
simpler, and in a less highly organised society there is less prospect of inter- 
fering with a system which after all works, even if not to complete satisfaction ; 
secondly, the consciousness of latent resources creates a greater readiness to take 
risks, owing to the general feeling that they can be afforded ; and lastly, it is 
recognised that industrial civilisation carries in its train certain dangers which 
can be more easily anticipated than remedied. The case is a little different when 
the comparison is institvited with countries in the primary phase of economic life 
in the more remote past. Here the predominant reasons are also three. There 
is greater self-consciousness accompanied by a knowledge of possibilities and 
risks. Again, in the modern country, law is to a greater extent a conscious 
act and to a less extent a crystallisation of custom. Lastly, the movement of 
economic life and the greater rapidity of progress make other and further 
changes sometimes actually necessary and always less an occasion for hesitation 
or anxiety. 

Still, a people encountering changes so rapid and sudden, and engaged in 
legislation experimental to such an extent, should look carefully to their armoury. 
Action or legislation in the economic and industrial domain, to be sound and 
effective, must observe certain conditions. The action of the State varies 
in its consequences with the relations between the people and the Government. 
A State which imposes law or exercises control as it were frorn the outside, 
acting autocratically or without any real identification of the private with the 
public will, encounters certain dangers. The essence of law lies in its ready 
acceptance, and this is peculiarly true of laws in the economic sphere which 
touch the social and home life and activities of the people. Now, any real 
feeling of community of interest between the people and the executive implies 
much more than mere popular election on however democratic a basis. It means 
a sense of participation in the acts of the executive, and involves a recognition 
of obligations as well as rights. To some extent, no doubt, this is furnished 
by high ideals in public life, but probably its surest basis lies in the partici- 
pation by individuals in some form of public administrative action. The saying 
that the strength of England lay in its local institutions means even rnore than 
w^as intended at the time. Voluntary service in local government is to be 
valued not only for what it achieves, but because it quickens the interest in 
the State, and, if widely shared in, begets in the community an enlightened 
knowledge of the problems and methods of government. Again, State action, 
to reap a fruitful liarvest, must be based on knowledge; and here I touch on 
a topic which deserves more time than is at ray disposal— namely, the importance 
in such countries of economic study and the methods which this snould 
follow. It is precisely amidst surroundings where the mass of new data is 
great that the need is greatest for scientific metliod in the examination of such 
data and in their comparison with the phenomena existiiiig in other countries. 
Economic theory and systematic economics form part, but only part, of the 
necessary equipment of the modern economist, and their function is not infre- 
quently misunderstood, and stands in need of clear definition. They indicate the 
relations which, so far as our present knowledge goes, exist between different 
classes of phenomena, and especially between these in respect of cause and 
effect. They place at the disposal of the student a keen instrument and a means 
of fine analysis which enable him to classify and co-ordinate new data, to com- 
pare these with other data, and to avoid the fallacies and misconceptions which 



464 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F. 

beset the path and invalidate the conclusions of the untiaiued observer, lint 
much more is needed than these. To a knowledge of abstract things must be 
added acquaintance not only with economic history but also with economic 
phenomena as they exist and arise in the present. These furnish what may be 
called the content"of the study of economics, and it is the.se which the economist 
has to examine and analyse. To some extent the new knowledge thus registered 
may modify previous generalisations. The practical bearing of such study on 
the problems of government and State action is obvious. But, quite apart 
from this immediate importance, it is a matter for regret that in a country like 
Australia, where there is so much economic material, comparatively little as 
yet has been done to treat it scientifically, and so to add to the body of 
organised economic knowledge. 

I will take one instance. It is common knowledge that the labour legislation 
of Australia and New Zealand differs greatly from that attempted not only in 
old-established countries but in any of the other so-called new countries. We 
want a really scientific examination of the causes which arc responsible for this 
difference. It is easy to make certain suggestions. Something may be due to 
the fact that the economic growth in Australasia is even more recent than that 
of C'anada and the United States. Again, the manufacturing development is 
less advanced, and ho the capitalistic element which finds its surest footing in 
the industrial domain is less powerful. Again, the contact with the organised 
industrial system of the older world is different in character from that which 
occurs in the case of the other countries mentioned above. Moreover the early 
history of Australia encouraged reliance upon the State. But suggestions like 
these, and otiiers might be added to them, need careful investigation and 
detailed inquiry before they can be accepted as an adequate explanation of this 
problem; and such an investigation should be undertaken in Australia. 

Hitherto I have dealt chiefly with the explanation which the previous 
examination of the special features apparent in new countries affords of tlic 
nature of State action in such lands. 

I would turn now to an equally important question — what guidance, if any, 
is afforded as to particular defects which require attention or particular impulses 
and forces which stand in need of special encouragement? Incidentally some- 
thing has been said about certain of them. The comparative Aveakness of 
custom and traditions, in one way an advantage, is from another point of view 
a disadvantage. The dominance of customs is harmful, not because they are 
customs, but because old customs are often wrong or at least inapplicable to new 
conditions. But custom lies at the basis of the social fabric and enables a 
connnon consciousness as to right and wrong and a community of feeling and 
tliouglit which are all imjiortant in organised social life. It is ])ossible that 
State action, if widely participated in and sympathised with by the people at 
large, may strengthen tiie social tie. Again, the importance of local pul)lic work 
by all members of the community has been cmpliasised : it cannot be too 
strongly emphasised. The besetting temptation of prosperity, and particularly 
of prosperity as it appears in a new country, displays itself in too great a 
concentration on material wealth and too exclusive a reference of everything 
to a material standard. It may be said that the same tendency manifests itself 
in the older world. That is true. On the other hand, not only are the economic 
circumstances fostering it much less dominant and pervading, but the social 
order and traditions which survive from the past provide at any rate partial 
corrective. As has been said before, while there is much to criticise in the 
notion of an aristocracy by bii-th or of traditional and professional standing, such 
distinctions counteract the influence of mere material achievement as the test 
of success, and indicate a vague belief, however misplaced, in some immaterial 
standard which at least has the merit of implying obligations as well as rights. 
But on what can a new country rely? On the one hand, on the recognition of 
the sheer excellence of manhood and character quite apart from material 
results; on the other hand, on a belief in education and knowledge in the wider 
and higher sense. This lends a peculiar importance to the encouragement of 
science and the development of educational ideals in a new country. 

In the survey just attempted certain causes have stood out so prominently 
and as so influential in their results as to demand a few words of comment. 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 465 

Foremost among these is contact between nations in differing stages uf develo])- 
nient. So much has been said of the economic aspects of this as it occurs 
between two particular types of countries that any summary would entail repeti- 
tion, and repetition would be tiresome. But the subject might well be treated 
in much greater detail and with reference to nations and people of more kinds 
than these, and to the more general social and political features and results. 
No modern country, and in particular no new country, can escape the influence 
of external factors controlling or deflecting or retarding the course of its 
orderly evolution. These forces operate under different conditions, and the 
consequences which ensue vary greatly. Sometimes nations standing at almost 
opposite extremes are brought into close relations. The matter is further 
complicated when political relations exist between the countries in question. 
To deal much further with this matter is hardly possible at the present time. 
Still, two things should be added. On the one hand, nations exercising 
political control over other countries and races, and particularly over countries 
and races less advanced in general civilisation and often marked off from them 
by racial characteristics, bear a heavy burden of responsibility. The very rela- 
tionship stimulates growth in the subject people, and yet it may well be that 
such growth may be so premature and so out of congruity with" essential con- 
ditions as to call for measures which may retard rather than encourage it. On 
the other hand, it is the duty of the historian, and particularly of the historian 
who is an economist also, to disentangle the various influences interacting, co- 
operating, or conflicting in the evolution of the social and economic life of a 
country, and to make due allowance for forces which work obscurely and in a 
very subtle way. Secondly, the effects of sheer rapidity in growth must not be 
overlooked. Tlie application of modern and more scientific methods to rich 
latent resources is sure to operate in this direction, and it may be assisted 
by other causes. Certain consequences are almost inevitable. Not only is the 
national spirit and type affected, particularly in the economic aspect, but with 
the denial of the time requisite for the orderly and stable evolution of custom 
a great call is made on the innate qualities of the race concerned if true progress 
is to be achieved and its fruits secured. Lastly, to a nation in the early stages 
of development, the spectacle and record of the experiences of other nations 
which have trodden the like paths, though under other conditions, mean a great 
deal. There is much to imitate as well as much to avoid, and, what is still 
more important, there is much to learn. 

Jjut whilst I say this, I would not have you think that an old country has 
little to learn from those which are younger. It is true that it cannot retrace 
its steps, and that the opportunity furnished is different in character. Still, as 
an economist from the older country, I would say that we expect to gain much 
for our guidance from the bold attempts made on this side to grapple with 
problems many of which, though differing in their setting, are the same in 
essence as those which meet us at home. Neither on one side nor the other is it 
a question of mere imitation. Each country has its own destiny to fulfil and 
must traverse its own course. The experience of others exhibits the connection 
between cause and effect, and those profit the most from example who dis- 
criminate wisely and best adapt its teaching to their particular conditions. 



The following Papers were then read : — 

1. Town Planning in relation to the Community. 
By ^YILLI.\M E. Davidge. 

Modern Legislation.— T\\q English ' Town Planning ' Act of 1909 has focussed 
public attention on the subject, but this Act was long preceded by the Italian, 
Swedish, and Prussian Town Planning Acts, all of which provide not only for 
town extensions and new streets being laid out on the lines prescribed by the 
municipal authority, but also give the authorities much greater powers of 
purchase or expropriation. 

Buihliiujs. — In most cases different parts of a town require special treatment, 
and in German town planning practice it is customary to divide the town area 

1914. H H 



466 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F. 

into zones, each with special building regulations and restrictions as to height, 
number of stories, and open space. 

Factory Zones. — Even under the English Act factory zones or districts may 
be prescribed, to which may be banished all businesses likely to cause objection 
by reason of smoke or noise. Such districts must necessarily be in close touch 
with railway or water transit, and if possible on the leeward side of the town ; 
with the growing use of electric i30wer, factories are becoming less objectionable, 
but it is still desirable to segregate them. 

Land Values. — In practically all countries the constant increase in value of 
urban land has resulted in a corresponding increase in the height of buildings, 
which in turn has resulted in still further increase of value, the one reacting 
constantly on the other. 

Limitation of Houses 'per Acre. — lu England much is hoped from the 
limitation of houses per acre. The effect of such a limitation must be at least 
twofold : it tends first to spread the town and consequently the values over a 
larger area; and by restricting the use to which land is put, may to that 
extent decrease the value per acre of land which is already ripe for' building. 
At the same time it will tend to give a corresponding increase of value to land 
farther from the town. Its effect on the already overbuilt city areas cannot 
fail to be beneficial, for by fixing a standard for suburban development, a 
high standard of amenity and a low standard of price, it will be financially 
impracticable to force up values in the built-up areas above a reasonable limit, 
and economically impossible to unduly increase the congestion of building. A 
reasonable return may be obtained from the land, but nothing whatever will be 
gained by overcrowding. 

Town Extension. — The municipal authorities may by careful planning of new 
main thoroughfares and prescribing adequate width between buildings, not only 
provide new traffic arteries at a minimum of cost to themselves and the present 
ratepayers, but save imtold expenditure in future widenings and piecemeal 
improvements. To secure satisfactory results, however, in tliis, as in other 
urban problems, it is essential that some one authority shall have control of the 
general lines of the plan. 

In European countries there is everywhere evident a constant teiuloKy to 
extend the boundaries of the municipalities, and such a tendency is but a natural 
outcome of the desire to avoid the repeated waste and overlapping of divergent 
controlling authorities. 

Municipal Services. — With the growth of municipal services sucli as tram- 
ways, sewerage, water supply, gas, and electricity, the tendency towards centrali- 
sation of control becomes more marked, and there is a greater effort towards the 
realisation of the possibilities and ideals of tlie town as a whole. 

Ihiilwaijs and Traffic Facilities. — In a plan for town extension nothing can 
.safely be left out. Railways are as much a vital part of tlie plan as roads, 
and the position of railway stations and goods yards as important or more 
important than tlie location of shojis and traffic centres. In many a town the 
whole develoisment is throttled and contorted by one or more huge railway 
embankments laid down without regard to the growth of the town. In 
Germany, although railways are as autocratic as elsewhere, the need is frequently 
felt for revising the position of the railway stations and even the line of the 
railway itself, and instances of this description of complete removal of the 
railway have been carried out in numerous cases in connection with schemes 
of town extension (Frankfurt, Wiesbaden, Diisseldorf, Liibeck). 

Functions of Various Classes of Traffic. — All classes of traffic — railways, 
electric railways, light railways, tramways, motor and heavy goods traffic — all 
have their proper functions, and all must have their place in the town plan. The 
combination of light railway and tramway (Stadtehahn) so much used of recent 
years in Germany is full of possibilities, and the flexibility of the modern motor 
omnibus traffic must also be carefully considered. 

Neiu Streets. — In laying down the lines of new streets some form of classifi- 
cation of roads is desirable. In London a standard minimum of forty feet wide 
is adopted. In Australasia the minimum is sixty-six feet, but any such arbitrary 
standard must of necessity have serious limitations, and in many cases involve 



TRANRAOTIONR OF SECTION F, 407 

heavy and iiniipressary expenditure, both in constrnrtinn nnd maintenanre, 
to say notliintr of dust ;uid otlier inconveniences. 

Di.-tndrantiKjefi of Unv&lt;rfK.&lt;:nriIy Wiile lioa(l.&lt;. — The classification of rnads 
into arterial roads, secondary roads, and residential roads is commonly prac- 
tised in Germany and other European countries, and nowhere better than in 
Germany can be seen the disadvantages of excessive road widths, with the 
almost natural consequence of high rents and tall tenements. 

Garden SdhurhK. Ac. — Garden City and Garden Suburb schemes have every- 
where seized upon this possibility of economising, and in such places as Hamp- 
stead and Letchworth the residential roadways are not metalled to a greater 
width than sixteen feet, though the distance between the houses is maintained 
at sixty feet or more, this leaving room for forecourt gardens or grass margins. 

Access to Land. — Tn all problems of town development and the settlement of 
new towns the availability of land is of supreme importance. The questions of 
land values, land ownership, and land transfer are fundamentally bound iip with 
town planning, housing, and improvement schemes. 

' Betterment.' — No municipal authority can be expected to carry out any 
great scheme of improvement if there is no possibility of recoupment from the 
owners wiiose property has been improved. So long ago as 166G, in the 
rebuilding of London after the Great Fire, provision was made for ' betterment ' 
charges on the owners of the property improved; and, in default of municipal 
ownership, some such system of recoupment is unavoidable. 

'Special Assessments.'— In many American towns such as Kansas City, 
' special assessments ' for the acquisition of parks and similar purposes are in 
force and appear to be favourably received. 

Specvlafion and Land Transfer. — Speculation in land is much encouraged by 
the facility with which land transfers can be effected, and the effect of over- 
speculation from this cause is apparent both in Germany and in Australasia. 
The effect produced is a forced and unnatural increase of prices of land until 
we see the curious fact that land in Berlin is valued at three or four times the 
value of similar land in London, and, partly in consequence, nearly one-half of 
the population of Berlin live in one-roomed dwellings in tall tenements crowded 
round one or more internal courts. 

Methodx of ?V«ff//o7J.— Methods of taxation, too, must be considered in this 
regard. An annual site tax on capital value leads undoubtedly to the use of 
land, at any rate to the extent necessary to defray the amount of the tax. In 
ui-ljan areas this means that fewer jirivate open spaces will remain; in suburban 
iireas the tendency is to put up any sort of structure that will act as 
a 'taxpayer.' The results in either case must be unsatisfactory, in the absence 
of any jirojjer town planning scheme, defining the use to whicli any particular 
land is to be put in the general interests of the community. 

lA-dxiJiold and Fn( liold Tinurex. — The relative uses of leasehold and freeiiold 
systems of ownership have been much discussed. Leaseholds enable land to be 
acquired cheaply with the minimum of capital, and also have the advantage on 
the leases falling in of a considerable amount of property being under one 
control, thus enabling comprehensive improvements to be carried out, as in the 
case of the South London property owned by H.M. the King, the leases of 
which have recently fallen in, and the property has been largely reconstructed. 

Miinlripal Ownership. — In German towns the municipality generally owns 
from one-tliird to one-half of the whole available building land, thus to some 
extent controlling spetailation. and at the same time enabling the municipality 
to take the benefit of any improvement created by them. The great value of this 
method, however, lies in the control which it is possible for the municipality 
to obtain over the extension of their town. Individual freeholds, without some 
power of purchase or compulsory re-distribution as in the 'Lex Adickes,' will 
continually conflict with the interests of the community. In large estates in one 
ownershiji as at Letchworth and Hampstead, excellent results are obtained 
by central control, which gives benefit to the community and security 'to the 
individual. 

(,'inirrd Coni/iisions. — Town planning powers would be of immense advant.-ige 
to Australasia, but the special conditions call for special treatment and the

2. The Fjfjecl of Town Planning and Good Housing Condilions on Social 
and Economic Well-being. By James Johnston, J. P., C.E. 

Town planning is necessary for the purposes of making a reasonable measure 
of health and happiness— of physical, mental, and moral health, and strength- 
possible in all parts of towns, of giving ready access from one district to another, 
under the supervision of the Local Authority, and for compelling the owners of 
lands to lay out and develop a district on uniform lines as distinct from eacli 
owner developing his own miit of land without regard to neighbouring estates : 
and not only must cities of the future be well laid out, but in the older and 
congested parts of our towns the slums must be cleared away and amenities 
Ijrovided. The Town Planning Act of 1909 gives Local Authorities power to 
jirovide open spaces and to limit the number of houses per acre, one of the 
best provisions in a somewhat cumbrous Act. 

We have examples of the evil effect of overcrowding in many of the best 
planned towns, especially in Germany, where the people are crowded into tene- 
ment dwellings, entailiiig loss of physical and moral liealth, and economic loss. 

The clearing away of slum property in the central area of our large towns is 
one of the most difficult problems to be faced, but it must be dealt with dras- 
tically, as it is of equal or even greater importance than the laying out of new 
areas. 

The cost is the great difficulty, and under the existing law it can only be dealt 
with by clearing away slum dwellings in districts declared to be unhealthy areas 
under the Public Health Acts, and building houses on the cleared sites for the 
people who have been dispossessed, or by declaring the houses, separately, unfit 
for habitation, and compelling the owners to close, put into habitable condition, 
or rebuild such worn-out houses. 

The dominant difficulty in housing reform is the financial one. in providing 
the necessary minimum of quantity and quality for the accommodation of a 
worker's family, on account of the limited income of the badly paid workers, and 
their consequent inability to pay an economic i-ent. The real remedy would be 
to give adequate remuneration to the workers, as it is now generally accepted as 
ethically sound that the first charge on any industry should be an adequate wage 
for the worker, and the adoption of this principle would render unnecessary the 
payment of subsidies out of the public purse for housing purposes. 

The method of building houses for the workers in the future is resolving itself 
into a Collectivist system, as the private builder has failed to meet the demand 
effectively. Houses "built for the sake of profit-making entirely are generally 
inadequate, overcrowded, mean-looking in monotonous rows, and of inferior 
material and workmanship. This work will have to be undertaken mainly by 
local authorities and public utility societies. 

With facilities for obtaining "money at cheap rates, a thorough organisation 
of the work, the more extended use of machinery, and the adoption of concrete 
as the principal building material, it will be possible to produce houses good in 
design, hygienic, and permanent in their construction, to let at an economic rent. 



3. The Economics of Toivn Planning. By J. S. Nettlefold, J. P. 

Strong economic incentive is moi-e effective for reform than official regu- 
lations. To ensure good housing, it must be profitable to the owner, and bad 
housing unprofitable. The same holds good with cities and their development. 

The main objective of town-planners must be to provide healthy living and 
working conditions for all classes, especially the poor. The first necessity is 



TRANSACTIONS OK SKCTION F. 'J 09 

HtlccjUiitc .sii|i|ily of light and air. This means larger building situs at the old 
prices. Tiicre is a constant definite iiroportion between ground-rent and total 
rent. On small house property ground-rent equals one-sixth of whole. Cost 
of site is composed of (1) interest on capital ; (2) price of land ; (3) cost of 
development. 

(1) liitrnst on L'apiiul. — This is of prime imiiortance. Every 1 per cent, 
on capital represents about l.s. per week on each small house : hence the necessity 
for cliea)) capital, which is unobtainable unless the town-planning scheme is 
commercially sound. 

. (2) I'licr of Lund. — The supply of land available for building is severely 
limited by the fact tliat connnunication is not provided by public bodies except 
to de\eloped areas, and builders are only willing to build near to such communi- 
cations. Jn the vicinity of all centres there is land of low value due to lack of 
communication. 

Town-planners must increase supply of building land by opening up cheap 
land and at the same time restricting building density, thereby preventing 
undue rises in land values. The value of land is governed by its use. Land*^ 
owners should be met by allowing economical estate developme'nt and encourag- 
ing quick development, and should be given economic incentive to develop by 
rating land on selling price, not merely on present income. Overcrowding 
should be avoided by restricting building density, and, in justice to landowners 
assessors must recognise that restriction of building density reduces land values' 
Mam arteries should be cut, opening up new di.stri'cts through back land avoid- 
ing purchase of costly frontages. Sufficient width should be allowed between 
forecourts, but only a small width of macadam should be laid, completing with 
tree-planted grass margins and inexpensive pathways. Under common-sense 
town-planning building density is calculated jjcr gross acre, and therefore it 
will not cost landowners anything to give the land for these roads; it will pay 
them to contribute handsomely towards the cost of construction. 

(3) Cost of Dci-rlopment.— Cheap land is no good without rational develop- 
ment. Necessities must be provided before luxuries are considered. Light and 
air are more important to health, and much cheaper tiian magnificent architecture 
and extravagant engineering in the way of unnecessary sewers, kerbs, and 
gutters. The main objective of those primarily responsible for the 1909 Act was 
to reduce cost of town and estate development. Most town-planning schemes 
since published increase this charge instead of diminishing it. Unless care is 
taken, town-planning will result in worse living conditions instead of better— 
ride Paris and Berlin. Extravagant development raises rents, and makes decent 
living conditions economically impossible except for the favoured few. Harmony 
can be achieved without reckless expenditure. The City Beautiful is of no 
practical use unless it be also a City of Common-sense, providing healthy homes 
for all classes.

1. 'Ihe Australian Democracy and its Economic Problems. 
By F. W. Eggleston. 

The reputation of Australia as a scientific laboratory of social and economic 
experiments is to a large extent undeserved. The many departures made in 
Australia from the traditions of economic thought were not undertaken as part 
of a deliberate scientific enterprise. Nor have the results been subjected to 
that criticism which would satisfy an economist. In watching the develojament 
of the Australian democracy one has to realise that the process has been 
dominated by political considerations almost entireh'. In order to better social 
conditions, legislators have disregarded the accepted rules of economics, and have 
invoked the power of the State. The basis of their policy has been the belief 
that the political power could provide some substitute for the forces which under 
ordinary circumstances go to make social conditions. 



470 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F. 

ALislialiaii deniucracy is thus an instinctive uniational liuiiiau iiiuvement, 
a definite challenge to the canons of economic theory. An experience gained 
under such circumstance^ should be of considerable value, because it exhibits 
phenomena which might otherwise remain hidden. It shows us social 
institutions in a condition of disturbance, and enables us to see their working 
more clearly. 

The characteristic note of Australian democratic development, therefore, is 
the attempt to secure social ends by State activity. The more typical forms of 
such activity are : — (1) Nationalisation. (2) Regulation of various social con- 
ditions. (3) Regulation of wages. 

(1) Nationalisation. — Australian experience cannot be said to directly nega- 
tive the warnings against .State socialism. Yet the issues would not be stated 
in the old way. Many exceedingly valuable results attainable only by the 
exercise of State authority have been obtained. Much efficient work has" been 
done by State dei^artments, while, on the other hand, many gross failures can 
be recorded. A dogmatic condemnation of, or a bias against, State activity 
could not be maintained. Each phase must depend upon its own conditions. 
The tendency to monopoly in industry brings the issue of nationalisation more 
definitely before the public. 

(2) Regulation of Social Conditions.— Ho avoid the evils of centralisation 
and the danger of elaborate State-directed schemes, the State will frequently, 
instead of assuming the management of an industry or activity, regulate certain 
phases of social life so as to secure ends considered desirable. In other cases 
it may perform an important service upon which a great many other social 
activities depend, or it may control a tendency which, if unchecked, would 
thvyart the beneficial operation of the normal social forces. Thus the State 
insists upon conditions necessary to secure health and leisure for workers. 
It controls building, and formulates food standards. It investigates and 
guarantees the title to land. On the whole, experience in Australia is favourable 
to such activity. After intervention of the State, the normal social activities 
have readjusted themselves, and while the desired ends have been attained 
the vigour and well-being of the community has not been impaired. 

(3) lUffulaiion of TFa^res.— The main object of this legislation has been to 
secure industrial peace by fixing a mean wage between the demands of the 
worker and the offer of the employer. It has to a large extent failed in this 
object because it has been used as a means of securing higher wages. The 
question is whether the machinery set up has been successful in increasing 
real wages. The conclusion of the writer is that though the machinery is 
defective in many ways the real wages of the workers have been increased by it. 
A close examination of the economic conditions in Australia would be required 
to substantiate this conclusion. The enormous resources of Australia available 
to a small population and the relatively constant demand of labour, place 
Australia in a unique position. The effect of alien exclusion laws and pro- 
tection, as barriers to the supply of substitutes for highly paid labour, would 
have to be considered. On the other hand, evidence as to the effect of high 
wages and liberal conditions on the efficiency of the worker and of industrial 
organisation are important. The progressive effect of a transference of 
resources from the wealthier to the poorer classes on the general efficiency and 
stability of the economic system is another factor in the assessment of the value 
of such a system. Factors on the negative side would also have to be taken into 
account. At the present time a notable feature of the position is that wage 
regulation has intensified the capitalistic organisation and assisted the tendency 
to monopoly and agreements fixing prices. The political effect of the rise in 
the cost of living is likely to be very great. The masses now believe that the 
capitalistic classes have turned the tables on them. Some further step by 
representatives of the workers to relieve the pressure of the rise in prices seems 
certain. Such action will be either an attempt to fix prices in monopolistic 
industries, or wholesale extension of the principles of Nationalisation. In 
unofficial sections of the masses some steps in the direction of Guild Socialism 
or Syndicalism is strongly advocated. From the scientific ]5oint of view, a 
gradual perfection of the agencies wc have already installed would seem 
desirable. But tlie cxigenries of ])olitics render more drastic actinn certain. 
In such action the fundamental issues of social organisation are likely to be 



TRANSACTIONS OP .SECTION P. 471 

raised. This movement is likely to be bitterly opposed. The more liberal 
elements of the middle class which have hitherto favoured tlie forward move- 
ment have been estranged, and a class conflict seems inevitable. There is no 
need, however, to anticipate serious danger from such a conflict. The social 
equilibrium is not likely to be disturbed more than it has been in the past. All 
parties are clean and honest, and mucli good may result from a bold facing of 
ultimate social issues. 



2. Oil the Materials for, and the Construction of, Tables of Natality, 
Issue, and Orphanhood. By Cii.\s. H. Wickens, 4.7.4. 

This paper comprised a brief review of the statistical data available for the 
construction of tables of natality, issue, and orphanhood treated as functions 
of the age of the father or of the mother. It also outlined the methods adopted 
and the results obtained in using for this purpose the Census results and the 
Vital Statistics for the Commonwealth of Australia. 

The subject is one which possesses considerable interest from the standpoint 
of demographic statistics, and this interest is heightened by the fact that the 
results so derived are essential for tiie solution of some of the complex problems 
involved in the various .schemes of social insurance which have been introduced 
or proposed in various parts of the world. Statistics of average surviving 
issue of dependent age are also of importance in questions relating to such 
economic matters as the fi.xing of a minimum wage. 

In a report, furnished in 1911, on the actuarial basis of a scheme of National 
Insurance for the United Kingdom, two eminent British actuaries. Sir G. F. 
Hardy and Mr. F. B. Wyatt, estimated rates of natality as a function of the 
a(ge of the father from statistics of orphanhood for tlie DoininioTi of New 
Zealand. These data were employed, owing to the absence at the time of any 
suitable .statistics, for the United Kingdom. 

The method employed in this case was tlie indirect one of estimating, from 
the number of children living at the deatlis of fathers of various ages, the 
number of children who bad been born of fathers of various ages. 

A more suitable method is the computation of the rates from statistics 
.showing the ages of fathers at the birth of their children. Such statistics are not 
available in the United Kingdom, but in Australia the requisite particulars have 
been recorded and tabulated for many years past, and it is a matter for some 
surprise that this source of information has not previously been tapped for the 
purpose in question. 

Certain other experiences have been employed in this connection, the most 
recent being the 1911 Census data for Camberwell, England, employed by the 
National Insurance Actuarial Advisory Committee. In this case again the data 
for determining natality rates were not the ages of the fathers and mothers at 
the date of birth, but were the numbers of fathers and mothers of various 
ages who had living with them at the date of the Census children under the 
age of twelve months. From these latter data the rates of natality were deter- 
mined by an indirect j^roccss. 

Other experiences, referred to in the course of the paper, were that of the 
Hearts of Oak Benefit Society in respect of lying-in claims, the experience of the 
(Jonimonwealth Public Service in respect of surviving children, a similar ex- 
perience for the Public Service of New South Wales, and others. 

The special tables contained in the paper have been compiled from : — 

(i.) the Australian statistics of nuptial births according to the ages of the 
f.athers for the four years 1909 to 1912; 

(ii.) the age results for the Australian Census of April 3, 1911; 

(iii.) the mean population of Australia for the four years 1909 to 1912; and 

(iv.) the rates of mortality for successive ages derived from the Australian 
experience for tlie ten years 1901 to 1910. 

On the basis of these data, tables have been constructed, graduated and 
gr.iphically represented showing : — • 

(i.) the rates of nuptial natality for successive ages of males (natnlitj' table) ; 



472 TRANSACTIONS OF SEOTTON F. 

(ii.) tlie nnmber nf nn]itial cliildi-pn at each age surviving to mnlps of surrpR- 
sive ages (issue table) ; and 

(iii.) the number of nuptial children at each age rendered orphans by the 
deaths of fathers of successive ages (orphanhood tables). 

In the case of (i.) the working process consisted of : — • 

(a) the tabulation and graphic graduation of the data relative to births and 
male population: 

(b) the computation of the rates for each age; and 

(c) the graphic graduation of the deduced rates. 

In the case of (ii.) and (iii.) the process followed was that of the synthetic 
construction of issue and orphanhood tables. Given the number of births 
arising annually per 1,000 adult males of each age, and given in addition the rate 
of mortality operating amongst adult males of each age and amongst children 
of each age, the computation of the numbers of children surviving are readily 
obtained, and from these the numbers of children rendered orphans by the 
deaths of males of successive ages. 

In the computation of the issue and orphanhood rates allowance had to be 
made for multiple births, statistics concerning which are also available for 
Australia in connection with tlie ages of the parents. These statistics indicate 
that the average number of children per birth increases with the age of the 
fatlier, the rate of increase diminishing with age. 

Reference was made in the paper to : — 

(i.) tile siiMifes of material for the purpose of .«iinil;ii' raliuiitinns in resppit 
of females ; 

(ii) to tlie allowances to be made in certain cases in respect of pxniiptial 
children ; 

(iii.) to allowances necessary in some cases in respect of still liirths. 

It may be noted tliat in the publications dealing with vital statistics which 
are issued by the Commonwealth Statistician, the terms ' nuptial ' and 
' exnu|)tial ' are used in relation to birth as more c(n-rectly representing the 
fact than the more usual terms ' legitimate' and ' iUcgitiinatc' This course has 
been followed in the present paper. 



3. '/'//(' Prcacnl I'osilion of Ihe Doclrhie oj I iilrrest: 
By Professor H. 0. Meredith. 

The phenomenon of interest raises two distinct questions : first, why does 
interest exist at all? secondly, what determines its magnitude and variations? 
Broadly speaking, writers on the subject may be classed accoi'ding as they are 
chiefly preoccupied with one or the other of these questions. To this is partly 
attributable that tendency to argument at cross-purposes which characterises 
much of the literature of the subject. 

In regard to the first question there is, however, a fundamental cleavage of 
opinion, though what precisely is at issue between the disjiutants has never 
been clearly stated. This paper aimed at a clear statement of the issue; it 
offered a brief survey and criticism of the chief doctrines of interest — viz., the 
Productivity, Cost, Exploitation, Agio, and Dynamic theories. In conclusion 
the writer's own solution was presented in outline.

5. Tlie Siatisiical and Judicial Determination of the Minimum Wage i)i 
Australia. By Gerald Lightfoot, M.A., F.S.S. 

The object of this paper was to examine the principles which have been 
evolved in the course of Australian experience in the determination of the 
minimum wage under the Wages Board and Arbitration Court systems, and to 
outline the methods adopted for investigating statistically variations in the cost 
and staudards of living in the Commonwealth. The Wages Board system was 
(list adopted in Victoria in 1896, and was introduced later in South Australia 
(1900), Queensland (1908), and Tasmania (1910). In New South Wales and 
Western Australia, as well as in the Commonwealth (so far as concerns ' disputes 
extending beyond tlie limits of any one State'), minimum wages aie fixed under 
judicial systems by Industrial Arbitration Courts. 

In most of tlie Acts under which the various systems have been established 
there is an absence of definition of the fundamental conception of the living 
wage, with the result that the basis on which the minimum should be fixed has 
been evolved by the tribunals tliemselves. In recent South Australian and 
Western Australian Acts, however, the minimum rate is defined and must be 
.sufficient to secure a ' living wage ' to the worker. 

The work of the Wages Boards is conducted in an informal manner, and is 
of the nature of a round-table conference. The boards do not follow any 
common process in arriving at their determinations, and hence no definite prin- 
ciples can be found on which the minimum wage is fixed. Under the judicial 
method of compulsory arbitration, however, certain broad principles have been 
developed. In the early years of the work of the Courts the Judges apparently 
refrained from making any clear or definite statement as to the principles which 
they intended to follow, and it was not until 1905 that the duty of the Court 
to provide a living wage was first recognised in positive terms by Mr. Justice 
Heydon, President of the New South Wales State Arbitration Court. 

The next important pronouncement on the subject was made in 1907 by Mr. 
Justice Higgius, President of the Federal Arbitration Court, who, in ' the 
harvester case,' first enunciated the principles which have been consistently 
followed by that Court. The judgment in that case has also been frequently ■ 
cited and followed by State industrial tribunals. 

In the course of the paper the development of the principles on which the 
living wages for unskilled labour is based was traced, with special reference to 
other controlling factors, such as the ability of an industry to bear the increased 
cost due to a rise in wages, inter-State competition, the deduction of an amount 
equivalent to the value of board and lodging, allowance for ' tips ' and 
gratuities, the question of ' equal pay for equal work ' as between the sexes, 
and differential rates of wages due to local differences in cost of living, climatic 
conditions, &amp;c. In fixing the minimum wage for skilled workers the practice 
of first ascertaining the basic wage for unskilled labour and then applying the 
existing differences between unskilled labour and the various grades of skilled 
labour has been generally adopted. 

During the last few years the subject of cost of living has become acute in 
connection with the question of the minimum wage, but owing to the absence 
of 'precise, cogent, detailed evidence' the President of the Federal (Jourt for 
some years declined to give quantitative expression to the increased cost of 



474 TRANSACTIONS OF SKOTTON F. 

living. The basic wage in INIelbonrne of 7.5. per diem prescribed in 1907 remained 
unaltered until judgment was given in 1913 in the Gas Employee.?' case, wlien 
evidence as to the investigations made by the Commonwealth Statistician as to 
cost of living was first brought before the Court, and when the basic wage was 
increased to 8s. In Sydney, Mr. Justice Heydon conducted an exhaustive 
judicial inquiry towards the end of the year 1913 with a view to furnishing 
an authoritative declaration as to the basic wage, and also as to ascertaining 
some method of raising or lowering it with the rise or fall in the cost of living. 
His Honour concluded that the living wage for two parents and two dependent 
children (under fourteen years of age) was 48s. per week. 

The results of the statistician's investigations have now been adopted by 
industrial tribunals throughout the Commonwealth. The data are obtained 
mainly from two sources, viz., {a) householders' budgets, and (6) returns of 
retail prices and house-rents from dealers and agents in selected towns. The 
object of the former class of inquiries is to establish from time to time the 
actual expenditure on living and variations in standards, and of the latter, to 
furnish periodically index numbers indicating variations in the cost of living 
{i.e., in the purchasing power of money), both in regard to point of time and 
as between different localities. A novel and rigorous, though simple, metlnxl 
nf teclmique has been adopted and was explained in the i^aper. 



6. Land Tn.ralinv in Aufilralia. By G. A. McKay. 

The history of land taxation in Australia was briefly narrated, and the 
existing sy.stenis of land taxation, Commonwealth, .State, and Municipal, shortlv 
described. 

The writer pointed out that though the primary object of land taxation 
has been to secure revenue for the pur|joses of Government, there was also in 
some cases a secondary object, viz., to further some economic or social end of 
local or national advantage. The primary object, as a rule, dictated the weight 
of the impost ; the secondary, the character of the tax, and its scope. 

Tlie main justification for taxing land, as part of a general scheme nf taxa- 
tion, lies in the financial needs of Commonwealth, .States, and Local Governiiif 
Ijodies. 

The Commonwealth has few sources of revenue, but great financial needs, 
corresponding to national burdens. It has assumed responsibility for the 
defence of Au.stralia by land and sea. This has involved the provision of the 
beginnings of a navy, and the establishment of a scheme of universal militixry 
training. 

It lias accepted the oltligation to provide nld-age and invalidity pensions, 
and a maternity bonus. 

All these responsibilities involve large recurring expenditure, and though 
some payments have been made out of loan money, the fact that intei'est has 
to be paid on a growing public debt cannot be ignored. 

The several State Goverimients are responsible for the management of all 
.pul)lic affairs, excepting those devolving on the Commonwealth under its 
(Constitution. The State obligations include public instruction, the mainten- 
ance of public order through the judiciary and the police, and the construction, 
control and management of railways, tramways, and other public works, which 
are outside the scope of municipal powers. Much of this expenditure is not 
fully reproductive, and deficiencies in revenue must be met by taxation. 

Municipalities and other local authorities with similar powers undertake the 
construction, maintenance, and control of public works, the benefit of which 
is purely local. 

All these authorities, Commonwealth, State, and Municipal, have inde- 
pendent powers of taxation, and all have recourse to land as one of the main 
sources of revenue. 

The economic and social reasons for land taxation are included in two main 
branches — one the desire to make a breach in land monopoly, the other to ensure 
that land, the foundation of most national assets, is put to its best use from 
a national jioint of view. 

The history of land monopoly was traced to early legislative and administra- 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F 475 

live errors or oiiii.ssions, :uid to tlio abscnco of a prupur clasbifiLiitiuii of land, 
with separation of pastoral and agricultural interests. 

The perpetuation of the large estate once accumulated is assisted by family 
sentiment and the innate conservatism of the average landowner. 

The national desire that land should be used for its best purpose is kept 
alive by the agitation of men who desire to obtain land for agricultural purposes, 
but are prevented by the existii:g pastoral occupation. There is also a con- 
stantly increasing antagonism in the popular mind against those who misuse 
or neglect the opportunities afforded by the ownership of land. 

The experiments on hybridisation of wheat which resulted in the inventior 
of varieties capable of withstanding some degree of drought have brought 
immense additional rust-proof areas of land into the agricultural domain, and 
incidentally brought the owners of these lands within the scope of the attack 
directed against land monopolists and those who do not use their lands to the 
best advantage. 

The general policy of taxing land was analysed with special reference to the 
paramount need of encouraging land settlement, and the possible contingency 
that cumulative imposts of this nature may tend to create the impression that 
such enterprises are unremunerative. 

The independent action of Commonwealth, State, and Municipal agencies in 
this connection accentuates the danger, as each pursues its taxing scheme with 
a view to its own financial needs, and possibly without paying any regard to 
the gravity of the tax imposed by other agencies. The possibility of substituting 
one taxing and valuing agency for the existing agencies is discussed, and a 
scheme suggested which should minimise cost and secure greater consistency and 
efficiency. 

The Federal scheme of taxation was described with special reference to the 
policy of exemption from tax in certain cases; the graduation of tax; the 
taxation of secondary interests, such as land represented by company shares; 
and the taxation of absentees on the higher scale. 

The relation of the taxing scheme to certain forms of land tenure was con- 
sidered. The differentiation in treatment in favour of landholders in different 
States holding under almost similar titles was shortly described. 

The general effects of the several land tax systems in the direction of 
stimulating settlement and bringing about a more effective treatment and 
greater productiveness of land was illustrated by reference to available statistics.

i. On Certain CJiaracteristics of Manufacturinq huluslnj in Auslndia. 
By G. H. Knibbs, C.M.G., F.S.S. 

In this paper characteristics of manufacturing industry in Australia arc 
quantitatively analysed from the data covering all such industries in that 
country. The basic principle of the analysis was to form such groups as would 
disclose the relationship of the elements compared, the groups being large 
enough to minimise merely accidental influences. In doing this the arbitrary 
magnitudes of individual businesses and the absolute cost of the material used 
were eliminated from the problem by restricting the analysis to capital invested 
per employe, the added value per employe, horse power per employe, and so on. 

It is shown a priori that certain characteristics of the relations, for example, 
of ' added value ' and wages, both per employe, to capital invested per employe 
are likely to obtain. These may be expressed by an equation of the form 
!/= Ae-"*-P. 

The personal and local factors mark this in small gioupings, and even in 
groupings for individual industries. Certain large groupings seem to sliow 
tliat these a priori deductions do characterise industry in tiie aggregate. In the 
endeavour to secure from industry the highest wages possible 'added value' 



476 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION P. 

measiii't's the iiii|ioita.iice of industry to the employe, but not to the i&gt;niprietor 
or proprietors. Tlie proper reduction of this covers interest charges and general 
risks of industry, and is often misunderstood. This is scarcely less important 
in cooperative industries in a country in touch with the world. This fact is 
IJrobably not adequately appreciated. 

The value of wages, paid in money, depends upon the purchasing power of 
wages, i.e., upon 'effective' wages; i.e., their value reduced to some common 
datum, which is best measured by the cost of a ' composite unit.' In Australia 
wages in some industries have been determined on the principle that they 
should be equated to the changing prices of commodities, or 'cost of living.' 
In principle, to be equitable, this must be general. But the direct effect will 
be to increase the jirice of commodities, and thus to force them continually 
upwards, and thus to defeat itself. The tendency may be exhibited by coni-

adjustment. The effect is startling, and tiiough jierhaps of less consequence in 
a self-contained country, is of a far-reaching significance to a country in 
competition with the rest of the world. The complete solution of the problem 
is very difficult even for a self-contained country. 

Economic investigations to be of high value must be quantitative, and only 
in this way can either their scientific or .sociological value be advanced. 



2. Ksi'nnaic nf Ihe Privalc Wcallh of a Cuiitinuiiily and llie Mcdsuro of 
its Uncerla'uihi. By G. H. Knibbs, G.M.G., F.S.S. 

It is very doubtful wliether the private wealth of a community can be 
ascertained witji any degree of accuracy even by means of an elaborate census 
of wealth, and even then comparisons at different dates would require to be 
used with caution. A rough estimate, made from a limited ])arcel, by means 
of which the average per individual is ascertained, to be applied to the entire 
population, would be subject to still larger uncertainty. 

Probably, for large averages, and in any one community, income and accumu- 
lated wealth are fairly closely related, and deductions may also be made on 
that basis. Such methods are subject, however, to obvious and grave limitations. 

Since death incidentally involves estimates of value of a deceased's estate for 
the purposes of probate duty, such estimates, which also are subject to grave 
defects, have been applied to determine the private wealth of the living, on the 
assumption that, with suitable precautions, the deceased group may be taken to 
represent the entire community. This is essentially a ' parcel ' method. 

The reliability of an estimate necessarily depends on the factor applied to the 
value of the estates of deceased persons to get the value of all estates. This, 
however, is subject to large accidental variations, and, moreover, is not constant, 
since it depends on the death-rate, itself a changing quantity. 

The solution reaches its highest value when age-groups are independently 
treated and its inherent limitations are also best disclosed thereby. There are 
characteristic differences between the wealth of the sexes and its variation with 
age, and these affect all deductions. 

Deductions from income returns may be related by a suitable investigation 
with those from probate returns. In this connection it is important not to rely 
on Pareto's so-called law. The apparent rough validity of this law merely 
depends on the fact that a considerable stretch of either branch of any unimodal 
frequency-curve can be represented by a general parabola or hyperbola 
y = Aa^^ where n may have other than integral values. It also masks its defects 
by dealing with aggregates, since the integral of the above expression is also a 
general parabola whose index is n + 1, and as a matter of fact is disposed of by 
a study of Prussian income returns. 

Probate returns can hardly be regarded as normal estimates of value, and 
expert estimates vary enormously according as to whether they tend to repre- 
sent cost-price, fair market value, or value at forced sale. Individual estimates 
made at leisure differ enormously, and may be either sanguine or conservative 
estimates, while the differences between esteem, utility, and market values are 
very great. 

The problem cannot be made absolutely definite, even by a Census of Wealth,

AnslraHan Defence. 
By Senator the Hon. G. F. Pearce, Ex-Minister for Defence. 

This subject falls naturally under two main aspects, Imperial and Local, 
with technical divisions, Naval and Military. 

Australia is affected by, and interested in, the defence schemes of the Empire, 
and every phase of the question must be considered from the point of view of the 
effectivene.ss of those scheme.s. 

The Imperial Conference in 1911 made full provision for the co-ordination 
of Australian Naval Defence w-ith the Admiralty plans. Theoretically it is 
argued that any .system of divided control is unsound, while, on the other hand, 
if local contiol is given np, local autonomy is surrendered. The latter course ha.s 
no chance of being adopted in Australia, the people of the Commonwealth con- 
sidering national sentiment more powerful than written agreements. A navy 
witiiin a navy is a logical outcome of a nation within a nation. The naval 
subsidy was never a popular arrangement in Australia. The Dreadnought scare 
solidified opinion in favour of an Australian owned and controlled navy. The 
expenditure on local naval defence has evoked no protest. British interests 
in the Pacific cannot be left to arbitrament of European nations or to the friendly 
keeping of an Asiatic ally. The provision of a fleet unit has made available to 
the Admiralty ships and personnel previously locked up in Australian waters. 
The Japanese alliance is only for a definite term, and at its conclusion a fleet 
could not be brought into being in a moment. Even a weak navy guarantees 
that there can be no land invasion until it is destroyed or neutralised, thus giv- 
ing breathing-time. The question of so directing the naval policy of the 
Dominions as to afford methods of effective combination and co-operation in time 
of war was decided for in the Naval Agreement of 1911. 

With reference to Military Defence, Australia has adopted the principle of 
compulsory universal military training. Persons enrolled under the Defence Act 
cannot be called on for service outside Australia. The obligation for universal 
service in time of war was always a feature of Australian Defence Acts. The 
claim for universal training is based on the fact that all are entitled to vote, and 
as the result of a vote may involve Australia in war, all .should therefore bear the 
responsibility. Voluntary service is unfair, and is found by experience to be 
ineffective. The vastness of the country demands a numerically strong force. 
All law is based UT3on compulsion and to some extent trenches on the liberties 
of the people. The distance from Europe makes it unlikely that Australia can 
take any effective part in European conflicts. Apart from its purely military 
aspect, the military .scheme provides for the physical training of the youth of 
the Commonwealth" and for universal medical inspection. Trainiiig from youth 
upwards instils discipline into the mind while still receptive, and is a substitute 
for conscription of adults and for the barrack life inseparable from a permanent 
army. Medical examinations take place at the ages of twelve, fourteen, and 
eighteen ; the particulars are entered on cards and tabulated, thus providing 
data of very great value to medical scientists. These examinations at the ages 
specified enable physical defects to be revealed, so that remedial action may be 
taken at such time as to ensure the future life of the youth being useful and 
healthy. The obligation of universal training will be an effective check on 
military jingoism by creating a sounder opinion on the realities of war. 

The possession of a navy makes it essential that naval bases and dockyards 
should be provided, and steps are being taken for such provision. The distance 
of Australia from fireat Britain as a ba.se of supplies renders it necessary to make 
local provision for munitions of war, and to this end various departmental

factories lia\'e hern rstablished. The magnitude nf Australia's maritime trade is 
a furtlier jiistificatioii for defence expenditure, apart from the fact that lier 
population and principal cities are chiefly confined to the sea-board and so render 
hor particularly vulnerable to attack. 

The most important events in the development of the scheme since its incep- 
tion are here outlined : — 

In 1901 the Deakin Government sent a representative to the Imperial Defence 
Conference in London, at which arrangements were concluded for the establish- 
ment of a Pacific Fleet, to which the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, 
and Australia were to contribute fleet units. Subsequently, the Federal Govern- 
ment asked the Admiralty to invite tenders for battle-cruisers. 

In 1908-9 the Fisher Government gave orders for three torpedo destroyers. 

In May 1910 the Federal Government invited the Admiralty to send out an 
expert naval officer to formulate a scheme of naval defence. As a result of this, 
Admiral Sir Reginald Henderson arrived in September of that year and pre- 
sented his report in March 1911. 

In 1910 the Fisher Government undertook to provide the remainder of the 
fleet unit, and at the present time, with the exception of one cruiser and three 
destroyers, which are in course of construction at the Commonwealth Dockyards 
in Sydney, the Australian fleet unit is in commission. 

With regard to the military scheme, the Deakin Government in 1909 invited 
Lord Kitchener to visit Australia and propound a scheme of Military Defence 
under the Defence Act. Lord Kitchener's scheme is based on territorial organi- 
sation. 

In 1910 the Fisher Government extended the provisions of the Defence Act 
to provide for adult training.

2. T/;e Heallli Aspect of Toivn Planning. 
B(/ John Robertson , M.D., B.Sc. 

Town planning in England, as we now know it, was originated to prevent the 
evils which have arisen in the larger towns due to crowding on space, and the 
baneful influences arising from permitting factories and works of all kinds being 
interlarded between dwelling-houses, in such a way as to make these dwellings 
dull and gloomy from the smoke-laden air, and dirty from the soot which gains 
access to the interiors. In most of these large English towns adec^uate space for 
the healthy recreation of the dwellers in the central areas was not provided, and 
ill most instances no attention was paid to the amenities of the district, except 
in a few instances where great natural features existed. 

It is very important that density of population should be limited to enable 
houses to be separated from each other : (1) to allow of sunlight gaining access 
to each inhabited room, (2) to permit of a current of air at all tunes round the 
house, (3) to allow of privacy in the dwelling without the necessity of covering 
windows completely with curtains, which have been proved to shut out up to 
ninety-seven per cent, of the actinic power of the sun. 

Artisan areas arranged on town-planning lines are difficult to compare with 
good areas on old lines as regards their liealth statistics. If one makes nil 
allow-ance for selection and class, there still remains so great a difference between 
the statistics of the new and the old conditions as to leave no doubt that in 
actual practice town planning is one of the greatest advances which have been 
made in recent times for the lieneflt of the public liealth.

3. The Planning of Sydneij — Past, Present, and Future. 
By John Sulman, F.R.I.B.A. 

^ Captain Pliillip landed on January 26, 1788, in Sydney Cove, now the 
Circular Quay, and formed the first settlement in Australia. In his earliest 
report he refers to the large trees covering the site, the rocky points, and deep 
water close in shore. His plan shows a street 200 feet wide, and allotments 
60 feet by 150 feet for each house, but it would not have been a workable one 
for a city as the outlets were not studied. 

The actual plan followed the lines of the original barracks on the Tank 
Stream, and the track to the surrounding country (now George Street) later on 
developed by parallel and cross streets. 

Up till 1809 the growth was more or less haphazard, but Governor Macquario 
then initiated many improvements, aligning the streets to 50 feet wide, abolish- 
ing nuisances on the Tank Stream, the only water supply, and reserving Hyde 
Park in perpetuity for the recreation and amusement of the people and 
exercising the troops. 

Sir Thomas Mitchell, the Surveyor-General, whose reports from 1827 to 18.55 
are available, did much to improve Sydney, and, had his suggestions been 
adopted, much excellent town planning would have been effected. He was 
responsible for the reservation of Cook Park, the preservation of native timbers, 
and the laying out of well-graded roads into the surrounding country. His 
many recommendations include a contour road which would have obviated the 
steep William Street hill, the artistic treatment of Church Hill by a crescent 
and obelisk and radial planning leading up to a dignified entrance* to Govern- 
ment House. He advocated wider streets, and obtained an order to align to 
100 feet if possible, and proposed an excellent lay out for North Sydney around 
the present Crow's Nest. He also effected many sanitary reforms t\jr trafliu 
purposes, and suggested small squares at street crossings instead of rounding off 
corners. 

Outside the city, however, speculators cut up land into small allotments 
with frontages to 20- feet lanes, and so laid the foundations of the slums of 
to-day. Later on, the outer suburbs were mostly planned with 40-fcet roads, 
but cross communication between suburbs was entirely neglected. Mr. (after- 
wards Sir) George Reid passed an Act to compel a niinimum width of 6G feet 
for all roads, which is still in force and has its defects as well as advantages. 

For twenty-five years the author has been advocating town planning, and 
ill 1908 this resulted in the appointment of a Royal Commission to consider 
the improvement of Sydney, and some of the recommendations thereof iiave 
been carried out, such as the widening of Oxford Street, the formation of 
Wentworth Avenue, and a new road from Woolloomooloo, and tlic resumption 
of one or two slum areas. But these improvements have been confined to the 
city proper. 

In 1913 the Greater Sydney Royal Commission recommended a scheme by 
whuh in time all the numerous suburban councils and areas would be absorbed, 
and power given to a unified council to town plan on a comprehensive scale, 
but legislative sanction thereto has yet to be obtained. 

As regards the future development of Sydney the most urgent problems 
appear to me to be as follows : — 

1. The provision of an underground city railway with branches to the 
suburbs. 

2. The building of the North Shore Bridge or tunnels or both. 

3. A bridge or tunnel to Balmain. 

4. The widening of the main city streets to at least 100 feet to provide not 
only for increasing surface traffic but for light and air to the buildings 150 feet 
high permitted by Act of Parliament. 

5. The formation of main north and south and east and west avenues. 

6. A proper convenient and beautiful land entrance to the city at the railway 
station, and a water entrance at Circular Quay. 

7. The setting aside of an industrial area with all facilities in the way of 
railway communication and water frontages, bo that manufacturing may be 
carried on to the best advantage. 



480 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F. 

8. The planning of a series of main radial and tircuniferential roads, 100 to 
200 feet in width, to link up all parts both of the Sydney of to-day and the 
greater Sydney of the future, and the planting thereof with trees. 

9. The provision of playgrounds over the whole area not more than half a 
mile apart, and parks or reserves not more than a mile apart. 

10. The reservation wherever possible of belts of open land in perpetuity 
between suburb and suburb, so that the greater Sydney of the future may 
consist of the city proper and a number of subordinate but economically self- 
contained and independent centres, and thus avoid the formation of a single 
large congested city area. 

11. The resumption of the foreshores of the harbour wherever possible, the 
allotting of specific portions for trade with adequate rail communication thereto, 
and the beautifying of the remainder for the use and pleasure of the public. 

12. The duplication of the water supply, for at present everything depends 
on one line of pipes. 

13. The passing of a Town Planning Act similar to the English one of 19(J9 
to enable many of the above suggestions to be carried out. 

There are many other improvements tliat could be suggested, but if the 
above are effected Sydney would be a city very different from what it is, and 
worthy to rank amongst its peers not only in Australia but in the greater 
world beyond the seas. 

In conclusion the author expressed his hearty acknowledgments of the 
valuable aid given him in his researches, and for the permission to photograph 
rare and valuable maps and plans by the authorities of the Lands Department, 
the Mitchell Library, the Municipal Library, the City Surveyor, and others. 



4. Tuwii rituniiiig in relation to Housing and HcallJi. 
By William E. Davidge. 

The present-day evils of cities are largely of modern growth and due to the 
rapid industrial expansion of the nineteenth century. Slums exist in 
Australasia as in Europe, though not at present to so marked a degree. 

The incidence of bad housing, wages, land values, and transit should all 
be considered. The evils of uncontrolled suburban development are everywhere 
apparent, and the effect of existing by-laws and legislation is in many cases but 
to increase the cost of living for the masses 

Cheap housing depends primarily on cheap land and cheap transit. Cottages 
compete favourably with block dwellings from the point of view of commercial 
and family life. Economic rent is, however, strictly limited, and capital 
expenditure on roadmaking and constructional works should be reduced to the 
absolute minimum. Prices of building materials are advancing, and the cheap 
cottage becoming increasingly difficult. 

Garden Cities and Gfarden Suburbs seek to amalgamate the forces of industrial 
progress with those of health and social welfare. In a system of garden suburbs 
linked to a central business community the advantages of both town and country 
may be secured. 

The effect of public open space and parklands is under present conditions to 
increase the value of land in the immediate vicinity, and thus in some cases 
to render still more difficult the housing of the poorest part of the community. 
The Garden City ideal is to bring every part of the community in close touch 
with the open country. The belt of agricultural land has many economic 
possibilities, apart from its use for allotments, recreation grounds, and similar 
purposes. The pioneer settlements in both Australia and New Zealand were in 
many ways practical forerunners of the Garden City ideal. 

The individual owner under a properly considered town-plamiing proposal 
has perfect security as to the development of adjoining properties, and the 
growth of a proper civic spirit can be encouraged. Co-partnership in housing, 
combined with the limitation of dividends, has achieved great success in the 
development of such communities, and by the aid of State loans there are many 
further possibilities of co-operation between State, municipality, and individual. 



TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION F. 481 

Cli'i'aler still is the possibility of bringing existing towns into cont'dvinity with 
Garden Citj' (irincijilcs. Legislation is necessary to proNidc for tlic town 
planning of future suburbs and the improvement of existing towns.

The following Papers were read : — 

1. Tlie Influence of Distribution on Production. 
By Professor E. P. Irvine, M.A. 

The object of this paper was to sujggest a line of inquiry rather than to 
attempt a complete demonstration. 

1. Owing partly to the fact that economists have often failed to give due 
weight to social reactions and interactions, the tendency has been to regard 
Distiibution as a result, and as a result only. The social income is always a 
function of production ; the amount which is actually distributed depends 
entirely upon the efficiency of the Productive system. 

2. There was no hint in the ' Classical ' Political Economy that an improve- 
ment in Distribution — 'by which is meant an approach to greater equality — 
might lead to greater social well-being than actual increase of the income. 
Professor Pigou has recently shown, and most economists admit the validity of 
his reasoning, that ' so long as the dividend as a whole is not diminished, a gain 
to the poor, achieved through more equal distribution, means an addition to 
economic welfare.' This is the first step in the line of argument suggested. 

3. The next step is to show that at almost every stage of industrial evolution 
there has existed a fund which might have been redistributed without in any 
way impairing the efficiency of production. 

4. Except in so far as they have recognised the ' economy of liigli wages ' or 
expressed, in stray passages, the belief that a more equal distribution would be 
a gain to production efficiency, economists have made no formal attempt to 
examine the further possibility that an improvement in distribution might lead 
to an increase in the dividend itself. It was the aim of this paper to suggest that 
carefully graduated approaches to greater equality will in the long run result 
in (1) a change in the direction of industry, and (2) an increase in the volume of 
production. 

5. The first point needs little elaboration. If the incomes of the wealthier 
classes, or, rather, the amounts they normally expend on consumption, were 
reduced by a given amount, and this amount distributed among the poorer 
members of tlie community, it is evident there would be, in consequence, («) a 
diminished production of some of the luxuries of the rich, and (h) an increased 
production of the necessaries, comforts, and luxuries desired by the poorer 
classes. No matter how slight the increase of ' purchasing power ' thus diffused 
among the latter, it will effect a change in the direction of industry. S^ociety 
will begin to organise itself in a new way, better calculated to promote the 
general welfare. Fewer workers and less capital will be engaged in the service 
of wasteful ostentation and in the provision of luxuries which tend normally to 
diminish productivity. 

6. But this diffusion of purchasing power cannot stop at a mere diversion of 
industry. Given time, it will exercise a powerful stimulus on the whole produc- 
tive system. The new force of demand, coming as it does from the millions, 
will be persistent and reliable, and will set in motion forces which tend to 
progressive improvements in machinery, in processes, in organisation, and finally 
to reduced costs. It will tend also to increase the supply of ability by brintJinc 
new classes to a higher plane of existence. ° ° 

7. There are, of course, limitations, but they are all capable of expansion 
They are : — 

(a) Available natural resources. 

{b) The capacity of all classes to understand the situation and to co-operate 
to make the most of opportunities.

(c) The recognition that if production is to be efficient no factor can safely be 
dejirived of the stimulus necessary to evoke its fullest service.

8. Illustration of the principle from a consideration of transitions in industrial 
history. 

9. Its relation to the question of a national minimum wage and to Wages 
Board awards. 



2. Some Tlioughts on Economic Evolution. 
By Professor H. 0. Meredith. 

Economic evolution is due partly to changes which are external to the indi- 
vidual and are largely non-economic in their own nature. It is part of the 
business of the economist to study these changes because they are in themselves 
indubitably economic phenomena ; but inasmuch as some at least of their causes 
belong to the data of other sciences, they illustrate the difficulty of drawing a 
precise line between the economic and other fields of study. 

Economic evolution is also partly due to a kind of activity which is both 
individual and in a strict sense economic. This activity may be called ' creative 
enterprise ' : it offers close analogies to the activities which chiefly determine 
progress on other sides of human life. The working of this force has been some- 
what neglected or disguised in the development of economic science : mainly 
because it lends itself so little to scientific measurement or analysis. This 
neglect is of small moment in statical studies, since the force plays no part in 
relation to statical phenomena. Its tacit exclusion from dynamic hypotheses 
is a more serious matter : a study of dynamic phenomena which neglects one of 
their main determinants is necessarily unsatisfactory. 



3. The Rate of Interest in Australia. By A. Duckwoeth, F.R.Econ.S. 

The circumstances which regulate the rate of interest have by many writers 
been treated in a somewhat loose way. The rate of interest on new investments 
of capital is that which is of chief importance. Some writers regard the real 
cause of interest as monopoly, and without private ownership of land, interest 
never would have existed, whilst compound interest is asserted to be wi-ong in 
theory. Such views need to be considered in any consideration of the subject. 
As regards Australia, borrowed capital has been largely availed of in the 
development of the country. The public debt of the Commonwealth exceeds 
three hundred millions, but is largely represented by productive assets such as 
railways, &amp;c. At times the internal market has been denuded of capital by 
Governments competing with private borrowers. The State, by means of the 
savings banks, has been able to attract savings of the community to the extent of 
about seventy millions. To stop the supply of Government loans would mean 
disturbance of trade and stoppage of public works already in progress. Austral- 
asian Government loans issued in London falling due up to 1920 exceed fifty 
million poimds. The importance of renewals on good terms is obvious. Next to 
Governments, the cheque-paying banks control large sums on deposit. Average 
deposits, one hundred and one millions in 1893, in 1912 were one hundred and forty- 
eight and a half million pounds. Tlie fire and life insurance offices form another 
financial factor with funds exceeding sixty million pounds and possibly becoming a 
dominating factor in the local markets. As they do not trade on borrowed money, 
and need not realise for long periods, they may impartially select both borrower 
and security. In England and America their operations are much more extensive. 
On the whole, Australia now owes overseas less than she did ten years ago. The 
security of the principal of her debt is of course undoubted, being based on 
public credit, backed by rates and taxes, and by the revenue from public under- 
takings and private enterprises. With a high rate of profit, such as is usually 
attendant upon the successful and rapid development of new countries, it follows 
that the rate of interest in Australia must continue for long enough to be higher 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F. 483 

than in older settled communities. The taking of interest presents itself in a 
different aspect now from that of the Middle Ages, when the actual prohibitions 
of the Church were constantly evaded by ingenious legal fictions. Supposing 
farmers in Australia to obtain a profit of twenty per cent, in comparison with 
farmers in England able only to obtain, say, a profit of ten per cent., the Austra- 
lian farmers can obviously afford to pay a higher rate of interest for the use of 
the necessary capital. The rate of profit determines in general both the maximum 
and ihe minimum of interest. If any monetary combination were to be pro- 
posed so as to secure any monopoly of capital — a money trust — Government 
moneys and funds of insurance and other financial corporations would be oppos- 
ing factors. The woild's need for capital leads to higher prices for capital. 
Australia is necessarily affected by the outlook, but unforeseen factors may 
modify the most careful attempts to forecast the future of the rate of interest in 
Australia.

The following Papers and Report were read : — 
1. The Economics of Marine Fuel. By Professor A. W. Kiekaldy.' 

The utility of the steamer was limited until : — 

(1) Coaling-stations were available at convenient distances on ocean routes. 

(2) Improvements were effected in the marine engine and boiler which 
resulted in a moderate consumption of fuel. Of these :— 

(1) was effected under British stimulus. First the mail routes were 
equipped with coaling-stations ; then, when these were prepared to supply fuel 
to all comers, the cargo-steamer became a possible competitor with the sailing- 
ship. Gradually all routes where steamers can operate have been provided with 
coaling-stations. In the first instance these coaling-stations were supplied with 
English coal. 

T'he mail and passenger services admitted of heavy expenditure which cargo- 
steamers competing with sailing-ships, and without subsidies, could not have 
faced. 

(2) The second limitation to the steamer was met by the invention of the 
compound engine in the year 1858. This invention opened up the possibility 
of steamers competing with sailing-ships for world-commerce. In 1881 the 
triple-expansion engine and subsequent improvements — quadruple expansion, 
twin and quadruple screws, the geared-turbine and the internal-combustion 
engines — have completed the victory of mechanical propulsion over sails. 

At the present moment the attention of managers of cargo-steamers is 
focussed on the rivalry between the geared-turbine engine and the internal- 
combustion engine.

Africa, etc.

Tlie Economics of Oil Fuel. 

Coal in its crude state can only be utilised for steam-raising purposes in a 
furnace, hence : — 

(1) the necessity of large coal-bunker space in steamers. 

(2) coal being comparatively difficult to handle and stow on board ship has 
to be placed near the boilei-s. 

(3) the bunkers occupy some of the best cargo space. 

(4) these very considerably affect cargo-carrying capacity, and so the 
economical working of the ship. 

Oil can be utilised in either a furnace or in a cylinder — i.e., may be used for 
either reciprocating or internal-combustion engines. This has several im- 
portant economic effects : — 

(A) Where used as fuel for reciprocating engines : — 
(i.) one ton of oil will do the work of \^ ton of coal. 
;ii.) bunker space is greatly reduced because : — 

(a) less fuel need be carried. 

{h) the oil can be pumped into any out of-the-way space in the ship; tlius 
spaces into which neither coal nor cargo could be stowed can be utilised. 

(c) oil can be carried in the ballast tanks. 

(iii.) economy in transporting, handling, storing, and stowing. 

(iv.) less labour is required : — 

(a) only about two-thirds the number of firemen need be carried. 

[h) no trimmers are required — these two items reduce the wages bill by about 
3.3 per cent. 

(c) the food bill is reduced by a like amount. 

((/) less accommodation is required for engine-room staff. 

The saving in wages, food, and cost of fuel in a recent trial of oil against 
coal, tried on the same vessel, showed an advantage in favour of oil of no less 
than 34/. on one day's steaming on a steamer of 3,800 tons. 

(B) In the case of internal combustion engines : — 

(i.) one ton of oil will do the work of four tons used for heating boilers. 

(ii.) there is considerable reduction of bunker space over oil-consuming 
reciprocating engines, and a very much greater saving of space over coal-driven 
engines. 

(iii.) there is the economy in hanrtling, transporting, storing, and stowing 
already noticed. 

(iv.) effects on labour : — 

(n) less labour is required; here there is an economy over engines driven by 
oil fuel, as neither firemen nor trimmers are required. 

(I&gt;) the number of the other members of the engine-room staff can be reduced. 

(e) social effects — these are important. The coaling and stoking of steamers 
have a brutalising effect on the men employed. • This is a blot on steam- 
ship service. The greater cleanliness and the better conditions of work 
connected with the use of oil as fuel will tend to raise the standard of one class 
of shipping labour, and will eliminate altogether a type of work which is 
inherently brutalising. 

(v.) the engines occupy less space and there are no boilers. Hence saving 
in space includes : — 

(a) bunkers. 

[h) engine and boiler-room space. 

(c) sleeping and other accommodation for the staff. 

(C) Sources of supply : — 

These are now known to be far greater than was once thought. They 
include : — 

(I.) Oil in the fluid state. 

(II.) Various shales, coal, etc., whence oil can be distilled. 

As to (I.) of areas already supplying oil there is Eastern Europe, and 
apparently a vast workable area running thence throughout Asia to the Pacific. 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION P. 485 

The known resources of North and South America are very great, and in 
Canada, the West Indies, and in many parts of South America there is pruniise 
of equally rich supplies yet to be tapped. 

As to (11.) the various shale areas have hitherto scarcely been worked. 
Scotland is rich in shales, and, only to mention newly discovered fields, there 
are rich shale areas in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. In nearly 
every land area there exist shales, coal of various qualities, or clays whence 
oils can be distilled. 

So far as coal is concerned, to utilise it in this way would result in 
economising coal resources, and much that is now wasted would be utilised. 

Some distilled oil contains impurities, but this drawback must sooner or later 
be overcome. 

(D) Price of oil :— 

This at present is a problem, but some experts are sanguine that when the 
oil i}idustry is efficiently organised the great supply available will sell at a 
moderate price. 

It has been estimated that, given an efficient internal-combustion engine, oil 
at even 61. a ton would show a saving over coal-driven reciprocating engines, at 
current coal prices. 

(E) The need of the moment is that the Empire should train men to work 
its resources, which promise to be ample for all purposes. At present oil experts 
are either Americans or natives of Eastern Europe. Hence the British industry 
is, to some extent, in the liands of those possibly having antagonistic interests. 

Only one University in the United Kingdom has organised a course of 
training for oil-mining. Every modern University in the Empire should supply 
this training. 

In conclusion, this is not merely a matter of international commercial 
competition. It is a far wider question on which the healthy social development 
of the Empire may depend. Sources of power must be developed to the utmost 
in the interests not only of the trade and commerce of the Empire, but of the 
world as a whole. The possibility of the British Empire taking a lower place, 
when it contains resources which should enable it to lead the world, would 
result in a set-back to civilisation. 



2. The Selection of Employ)nent for Juveniles. 
By Mrs. CM. Meredith. 

The selection of employment for juveniles has only recently become a matter 
for State action in England. Attention has been directed to it primarily as one 
side of the general movement for dealing with unemployment, and as a means of 
lessening the number of ' blind alley ' occupations adopted. 

In this paper I propose to discuss two questions : — 

1. The considerations of economic importance to the community which should 
be kept in view in selecting employment for a boy or girl leaving school at 
fourteen. 

2. The information at present available to aid in such selection and in what 
ways this requires amplification. 

1. From the economic point of view the boy's future work as an adult citizen 
is more important than his present capacity for work ; hence an employment must 
be regarded as ' bad ' not only («) if it tends to produce deterioration (whether 
physical, mental, or moral) in the worker, but also {b) if, although healthy and 
desii-able in itself, it prevents him from getting the training required to enable 
him to earn an adequate wage when he is grown up. 

It is also necessary to consider how far a boy's success is dependent on the 
nature of the occupation he selects and how far it is chiefly a matter of character 
and 'general ' intelligence. On this point different opinions are held, and some 
questions await further investigation, notably that of the connection between 
enjoyment of work and efficiency. 

2. We require to know (a) the conditions prevailing in the various employ- 
ments and the qualities demanded in those who enter them; {b) the qualities 



486 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F. 

and tastes of the boy seeking employment. On the former point a considerable 
body of evidence is readily available, and more can be obtained without serious 
difficulty. The second point presents many more obstacles. The chief sources of 
information are : (1) The boy himself^ (2) his parents, (3) other persons interested 
in him, such as members of the school care committee, (4) the reports from his 
school. 

Of these sources of information the possibilities of No. 4 have as yet hardly 
been recognised in England, with the exception of the reports relating to health. 
The school reports on other matters could be extended, and could be based on 
evidence collected, by experimental or other means, directly with a view to find- 
ing the special qualities whose presence or absence is important as a guide to the 
selection of work.

4. Industrial Arbitration in relation to Socialism. 
By F. A. A. EussELL, M.A. 

The system of Industrial Arbitration commenced in New South Wales by the 
Act of 1901 (Mr. Wise's Act), the Board system introduced by the Act of 1908 
(Mr. Wade's Act), the rapid creation of Industrial Boards dealing with nearly 
all industries in Sydney and in many country parts. This Act becomes a means 
of rapid introduction of State regulation of labour both as to wages and other 
industrial conditions ; the system of the Wade Act continued and enlarged by the 
Act of 1912 (Mr. Beeby's Act). So that for most practical purposes we may 
regard the operation of Industrial Arbitration from 1908 to the present moment 
as the working of a continuous system, subject mainly to some diSerence of 
administration. 

A. First main result of the 1908 Act : — (1) The spread of unionism is 
assisted and accelerated both in the country and in the metropolis in industries 
where it had before very little foothold, and (2) the consolidation of unionism 
where it already obtained. The 1912 Act helps on completion of this process. 

B. Further results : — It is my opinion, and I shall attempt to show, that the 
Wade Act introduced a larger measure of Industrial Socialism than the leaders 
of the party which passed it realised at the time. Suggest there are few people 
who realise now the changes capable of being achieved in the industrial structure 
of society, and which are in part occurring at the present moment, under these 
and similar Acts. 

Some description of the more important controversies which have arisen in the 
working out of the system and some understanding of the stages reached to date 
on the lines of these controversies required to illustrate these views. 

(1) Preference, to Unionists tends to drive all men into Unions ; the mild form 
in which it is allowed in New South Wales tends to mitigate personal hardships 
in transition stage ; its chief value to the Unions lies in fact of further recog- 
nition, plus an organising value — not directly injurious to employers (unless the 
whole system is injurious) — a part of a Socialist movement, but right in kind. 
Combat the idea that personal freedom is really menaced by unionism. 

(2) The lines of development of unionism, and of the jurisdictions dealing 
with industrial matters. The Crafts v. Industries argument in relation to the 
principles on which Unions are constituted, and jurisdictions dealing with them 
marked out. Earliest administration of the Beeby Act represents high-water 
mark for Craft Unionism in New South Wales. Both the Craft and the Indus- 
tries Union are necessary. The problem of adjusting their rights. Opinion that 
Unions constituted on the Industry basis are the more suited to modern develop- 
ments, and the mere force of circumstances is favouring this principle of con- 
stitution, while the Crafts Unions act as a conservative check. The Industries 
Union may favour Syndicalist action, but any danger in that should be averted 
by means other than an attempt to favour the Craft Union.

ment and instances of increasing diversity of rates^general tendency. 

C. Rising Wages. — How far the Boards have created, and how far merely 
regulated, a rising tide of wages. The effect of increases of wages upon 
employers, assets, and business. The relevancy of profits to wages, and the 
movement towards the adoption of higher standard for prescribing rates of wages 
rather than the mere prevention of sweating; prescribing the standard wage. 
Conjecture as to the future operation of the system in periods of falling as well 
as of rising markets. 



5. The Artificial Begulation of Wages. By G. S. Beeby. 

The original conception of the Australasian experiments in industrial regula- 
tion was the prevention of sweating by the legal enactment of minimum wages. 

To this has been added the statutory prohibition of strikes and lock-outs, and 
the consequent establishment of tribunals with power to substitute elaborate 
codes of working conditions, capable of legal enforcement, for voluntary con- 
tracts of employment. There is now sufficient data available to justify a critical 
analysis of this experiment. 

Industrial arbitration has been successful in removing from Australia the 
reproach of sweated industries, and in raising the standard of unskilled workers. 

It has proved that permanent conciliatory machinery is of value in bringing 
disputing parties together and effecting earlier settlement of serious strikes. 

Constant open inquiry into the wages and working conditions of employees 
has been of great educational value and has led to more sympathetic considera- 
tion by the general public of the wage-earners' agitation for a higher standard 
of comfort, and to a wider public interest in economic problems. 

It has failed to give the promised immunity from strikes and lock-outs, but 
has reduced the duration and intensity of serious industrial disturbances. By 
encouraging and facilitating the organisation of employees in many occupations 
which were not previously unionised it has increased the number of minor strikes. 

It has contributed to a decline in the standard of efficiency in two ways : 
first, by largely increasing the wages payable to unapprenticed juniors, thereby 
reducing the incentive to follow fixed trades; secondly, by — in exercise of its 
arbitral functions in settlement or prevention of strikes — prescribing high 
minima, which become ' standards,' thereby removing the competitive incentive 
to inefficient workmen to improve their earning capacity. This decline in effi- 
ciency is accompanied by a reduction of output. In many occupations, notwith- 
standing the increase of wages, the average output per employee has substan- 
tially decreased. But this cannot be regarded as a result of artificial regulation 
of wages. It is clearly traceable to shortage of labour — the continued increase 
in demand for workmen, without a corresponding increase in supply. 

Australia's greatest period of material development and progress has syn- 
chronised with its industrial experiments. Employers as a class have up to the 
present generally been able to adjust increased labour cost without reducing 
profits. But we are approaching the breaking-point. The elaborate codes which 
the Arbitration Courts substitute for ordinary contracts of employment, and the 
persistent increases in minimum wages, will shortly begin to encroach on profits. 
When this happens, and shrinkage of enterprise follows, a general reconsidera- 
tion of the whole scheme of industrial regulation is inevitable. 

Before long I believe we will sift the good results from the bad, and out of 
the whole system will retain the living wage, the maximum hours of employment, 
and a revised scheme of apprenticeship. We will draw a line below which tliero 
will be no competition for employment, but above which the ordinary economic 
forces will again come into play. 

The elaborate machinery now existing will give way to a Board of Trade 
which will each two or three years prescribe a general living wage. The attempts 
to penalise strikes and lock-outs will give way to simple conciliation machinery, 
under which every threatened industrial upheaval will be openly inquired into 
and the parties encouraged and assisted to voluntarily settle their differences. 

The worker will before long realise that we have reached the limit of artificial 



488 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION P. 

regulation of wages, and that his energy in the future will be better directed to 
increasing the purchasing power of his sovereign, rather than to adding another 
sovereign to his weekly wage. 

6. Tlie Development oj Organisalion in relation to Progress. 
By W. R. Scott, M.A., D.Phil., Litt.D. 

Though the name ' organisation ' is comparatively new, the idea is old. In 
Mercantilism there was involved the conception of the organisation of States on 
a national basis instead of the mediaeval one of a manor or city, and a somewhat 
similar tendency may be seen at the present time in the development of the policy 
of new countries. The view that the Physiocrats represent a revolt against 
Mercantilism is erroneous. There was really continuity of thought. While the 
Physiocrats aimed at an ideal of cosmopolitanism, organisation came to be con- 
sidered as something emanating from the initiative of individuals, not from the 
State, as with the Mercantilists. Under the influence of Adam Smith this idea 
continued till biological studies gave as a by-product the conception of ' social 
organisms,' whence organisation acquired a new meaning in relation to the creat- 
ing of such organisms or adding new functions to them. The implied reference 
to a social organism causes organisation to be used in an analogical sense, and 
there is a tendency to abstract the mode of organising from that which is 
organised, and to hypostatise the abstraction — as when organisation is termed an 
agent of production. 

The modern conception of organisation, when duly limited and defined, is 
valuable in suggesting an organic reference; and as indicating that an organised 
body is something different from the parts which go to the making of it. But the 
term ' organisation ' is generally applied to small groups of persons, which may 
behave antagonistically to each other. Hence, in this use of the word, modern 
organisation is narrower than that which the Mercantilists aimed at. Socialism, 
on the other hand, presents a niore comprehensive idea of organisation, but one 
which most of its advocates now believe is unlikely to be brought into existence 
as a completed whole, and which can only be approximated gradually by succes- 
sive stages. 

In addition to what is now usually called organisation, there is also social 
organisation, which is often described as social betterment, social service, or social 
reform. This movement involves united action by the whole community for 
improving the condition of some section of its members, in the belief that such 
action is for the ultimate, if remote, benefit of the State. Instances are to be 
found in State-education, State-controlled immigration, labour exchanges, sick- 
ness insurance, invalidity insurance, conciliation or arbitration in labour disputes. 

Social organisation differs from the primarj' form of State-activity (e.g., the 
defence of the country or the administration of justice) in that, while both are 
administered by the State, the latter concerns all citizens, while the former 
relates much more nearly to certain groups only. Modern social organisation 
differs from that of the Mercantilists in being concerned in the first instance with 
the creation of immaterial wealth, though in the end it is likely to yield a vast 
return on the labour and outlay in material wealth also. But that return cannot 
he predicted as absolutely certain. In most cases the result of social reforms 
only appears after a long lapse of time, and therefore there is the danger that, 
in the interval before actual experience yields a verification or refutation of the 
special form of organisation, social welfare may be pro tanio diminished instead 
of being increased. Therefore the conditions under which social organisation 
must be carried on render it imperatively necessary that the widest and most 
accurate knowledge of economic and social conditions should be available, aided 
and supplemented by the tact and judgment of the man of affairs. 



7. The Economic Ideal. By Professor S. J. Chapman. 

This paper was an attempt to define the main economic characteristics of the 
ultimate end that should be aimed at by social reform. On the productive side 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F, 489 

the need of efficiency is obvious, but in addition production should be directly 
yielding in satisfaction and be responsive to demand. From these desiderata 
important practical corollaries can be deduced. Two maxims of distribution 
can be laid down — the one leading to distribution according to needs, and the 
other to distribution according to productive value. They appear to conflict, but 
analysis of fundamental ideas seems to show that their harmony is not inherently 
impossible. In consumption or demand the ideal is easily stated, but the 
reform of demand has hitherto proved itself a remarkably intractable problem. 
' Individualising ' betterment is of great value, but massive results can only 
be attained when it is aided by a suitable environment and measures calculated 
to mould class ideas. Socialism and Individualism, as commonly understood 
to-day, relate mainly to means. Advocates of both may agree as to ends ; and to 
attain this agx-eement would save endless futilities in discussion and action.

Section G.— ENGINEERING. 

President of the Section.— Professor E. G. Coker, M.A., D.Sc, 

M.Inst.C.E. 



The President delivered the following Address at Sydney on Friday, 
August 21 : — 

The subject of stress distribution in materials, which I have chosen for this 
address, is not one which an engineer can claim as his peculiar province, for it 
has been and still is a fruitful field of investigation for the mathematician, the 
physicist and the geologist, and has always been so since the commencement of 
scientific inquiry; indeed, it must have been the source of speculation and con- 
troversy ever since mankind emerged from a primitive state, and began to fashion 
dwellings, weapons, and tools from the materials at command. 

The development of architecture from the earliest dwellings of savage races 
to the great temples of Egypt and Greece, the bridges and aqueducts of the 
Romans, and the medifeval buildings of Europe, all bear witness to the accumula- 
tion of practical knowledge of the properties of materials and of the stress dis- 
tribution in structures, which we cannot fail to admire, although we know far 
too little of the way in which these ancient structures were planned and con- 
structed. The magnificent arched and domed buildings of the Roman period, and 
the stately cathedrals of later times with their wealth of architectural form — 
tower and spire, flying buttress and vaulting — all show how considerable was the 
practical knowledge of stress distribution possessed by the master builders who 
planned and carried out these great structures. We, who inherit these buildings 
as a precious legacy of bygone ages, have at our command far greater resources 
in the accumulated knowledge of centuries of scientific discovery and invention, 
and can build more complex structures — great bridges of steel, towering frame- 
works covered by a thin veneer of masonry, and floating arsenals of the most 
bewildering intricacy. All these we can show to our credit as the result of the 
steady increase of scientific knowledge applied to practical ends, but, even now, 
knowledge of the stresses which come upon these complex structures and 
machines is relatively small. Scientific investigations of engineering problems of 
stress still lag behind constructive ability, and defective knowledge is obscured 
more or less by approximate theories and buttressed by factors of safety, which 
serve in one instance perhaps, but show in others that they have merely given a 
sense of fancied security with no real basis, and are more properly factors of 
ignorance, to be discarded at the earliest moment. Who, for example, can say 
with certainty what is the stress distribution throughout the compression members 
of a great bridge, built up of complicated steel shapes and plates, united by 
stiffening angles, gusset plates, and innumerable rivets? There is probably good 
reason for the belief that a great strut is relatively weaker than a small one, 
when both are designed according to the same approximate formulre now used in 
current practice, and engineers are unwilling to take the responsibility for such 
members in a great structure, without providing a very ample margin of safety 
to cover the contingencies arising from lack of precise knowledge of the strength 
of these members. So numerous are the problems which arise in the design and 
construction of machines and structures, that it is perhaps not unprofitable tq 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 491 

devote a short hour to the consideration of some of the available means which 
an engineer can use as a guide for his applications of science to construction, 
since of whatever kind are the professional activities he pursues, his place in the 
scheme of afiairs mainly depends on his ability to make machines and structures 
for directing and modifying natural sources of power in known ways, or applying 
them to new purposes as scientific discoveries advance the boundaries of 
knowledge. 

The power to do this depends, to no small extent, upon the ability to deter- 
mine the distribution of stress in a structure, and the skilful manner in whicli 
material can be disposed for the required purpose. 

It is of some help to our appreciation of the achievements of the great con- 
structors of past ages, if we remember that they probably all held the erroneous 
view that materials of construction are perfectly rigid bodies, and, indeed, we 
know that as late as 1638 Galileo Galilei was of that opinion, and that he came 
to an entirely wrong conclusion as regards the stress distribution in a loaded 
cantilever. 

It required the genius and insight of Eobert Hooke to make a really great 
step, with his celebrated theory of the linear relation of stress to strain, and we 
can appreciate the glow of pride and satisfaction which he must have felt at his 
great discovery, when he records in 1675 that 'his Majesty was pleased to see the 
experiment that made out this theory tried at Whitehall, as also my spring 
watch. ' 

Hooke had, in fact, discovered the fundamental principle upon which a 
theory of the elasticity and strength of materials could be based, and it would be 
interesting to trace the great advances which were rapidly made from this new 
vantage-ground, whereby the main facts of the distribution of stress in simple 
members of structures became known, and a foundation was laid for the great 
advances of the mathematical theory. If I am silent upon the enormous develop- 
ments of the modern theory of the strength of materials it is not from lack of 
appreciation, but because I do not deem myself adequately fitted to discuss the 
great work of the elasticians, which all engineers admire, and so few are 
equipped to follow with the full battery of mathematical tools which have been 
pressed into service in the pursuit of this great science. 

Among the greatest of the services rendered by early pioneers was that of 
Young, who was the first to notice that the elastic resistance of a body to shear 
was different from its resistance to extension or contraction, and this led him to 
define a modulus of elasticity for materials in compression. As Professor Love 
remarks, ' This introduction of a definite physical concept, which descends, as 
it were, from a clear sky on the readers of mathematical memoirs, marks an 
epoch in the history of the science.' 

From the standpoint of the engineer, nothing is of more practical importance 
than the great discoveries of Hooke and Young, that bodies like metal, wood, and 
stone are ' springy ' and have a simple linear relation between stress and strain. 
It is probably within the mark to say that nine-tenths of all the experimental 
investigations on stress distributions in structures have been entirely based on 
the fundamental principles which they enunciated, and new uses are continually 
arising. The recent application of the steam turbine to the propulsion of ships 
produced a profound change in marine-engine practice, and incidentally involved 
an entire reconstruction of methods for obtaining the horse-power developed, 
which had been gradually perfected from the time of Watt, but were absolutely 
useless for the new system of propulsion. Hooke's discovery of the essential 
springiness of metals enabled engineers quickly to devise new instruments capable 
of accurately measuring the infinitesimal angular distortions of propeller shafts, 
and from these to determine the horse-power transmitl/ed by the aid of an appro- 
priate modulus. 

Tlie construction of tall buildings affords another example where advantage 
has been taken to determine the loads upon columns by measuring the minute 
diminutions of length as the structure proceeds, thereby affording a valuable 
check upon the calculations for these members, and a reliable indication of the 
pressures supported by the foundations. 

The distribution of stress in buildings constructed of composite materials like 
concrete reinforced with steel has also been examined by similar methods, and 



492 TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION G. 

much data for guidance in future constructional work has been obtained, 
especially in the United States of America. 

The still more difficult problems involved in the determination of the stresses 
in joints and fastenings of complicated structures have often been investigated 
by purely mechanical measurements of strain, and the experimental investigations 
of Professors Barraclough and Gibson and their pupils upon the distribution of 
stress due to riveted joints and curved plates of boiler shells afford a notable 
example of the successful application of the measurement of small strains to a 
stress problem of great complexity. 

That ' science is measurement ' is here sufficiently obvious, and it seems only 
due to the memory of that great engineer, Sir Joseph Whitworth, to refer to his 
great mechanical achievements of a true plane and well-nigh perfect screw, 
which enabled him to measure changes of one-millionth of an inch, and thereby 
gave experimental investigations of strains a new impetus, which is reflected in 
subsequent work on the subject. Nor must we forget the no less important 
exposition, by Kelvin and Tait, of the scientific principles of instrument construc- 
tion which have done so much for the design of instruments for the precise 
measurement of strains. 

Mechanical measurements cannot, however, completely satisfy all our modern 
requirements, since they are essentially average values, and fail to accommodate 
themselves to many of the problems which press for solution. 

In the quest for exact experimental knowledge, the measurement of stress at 
a point becomes of paramount importance, and we may, therefore, inquire what 
further means the researches of pure science have placed at our disposal for the 
determination of stress distribution in materials. 

It is well known that many materials when tested to destruction show a 
considerable rise of temperature at the place of fracture, especially in very ductile 
materials ; but Weber was the first to discover that a metal wire when stretched 
within the elastic limit is cooled by the action of the load, and this result was 
deducted later from the laws of thermo-elastic behaviour of materials by Lord 
Kelvin, who .showed that tension and compression loads produce opposite effects, 
and that materials which have the property of contracting with rise of tempera- 
ture show thermal effects of the reverse kind. Although the changes of tem- 
perature produced by stress are small within the elastic range — less than 1° C. 
for most materials — yet their effect upon a thermo-couple is readily measurable 
if the equilibrating effects of surrounding bodies are neutralised or allowed for, 
so that stress distribution can be determined by thermal measurements at a point. 
The correction for such disturbing causes is usually an important factor, and is 
generally so large that experimental work is more suitable for the laboratory than 
the workshop ; but if all necessary precautions are taken a linear relation of stress 
to strain can be shown to hold up to the elastic limit of the material, while above 
this point the break-down of the structure causes a rise of temperature of so 
marked a character that it has been utilised by several investigators as an indi- 
cation of the yield point. 

Experiments, upon members subjected to tension, compression, and bending, 
fihow that thermal phenomena afford trustworthy indications of the stress in 
materials so diverse as a rolled-steel section, a block of cement, and beams of 
stone and slate. Although no attempt appears to have been made to investigate 
stress distributions of any great complexity, it seems not unlikely that thermal 
methods of investigation will ultimately prove of considerable value. 

The transparency of metals to Eontgen rays is another phenomenon which 
has often been suggested as likely to be of service for work on stress distribution 
in materials, and Mr. Howgrave Graham and I have examined a number of 
rolled metals under stress up to the breaking point, without, however, discovering 
any change in the appearance of the material as seen on a fluorescent screen. 
Although our experiments showed no perceptible change, it is, of course, not 
impossible that an effect may have escaped our notice. 

Another and still more fascinating field of research on stress distribution is 
afforded by the doubly refractive properties of transparent bodies under stress, 
a discovery made by Sir David Brewster almost exactly one hundred years 
ago, and but rarely made iise of since by engineers, although Brewster himself 
immediately saw its \'alue for experimental purposes, and suggested that models 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS, 493 

of arches might be made of glass, and the effects of stresses due to loading 
rendered visible in polarised light. 

Brewster carried his investigations further, by the invention of a ' chromatic 
teinometer ' for investigating the nature of strains, and consisting of plates or 
bars of glass subjected to flexure in definite ways for comparison with the body 
under stress. 

At a much later date (1841) Neumann developed an elaborate theory for the 
analysis of strain in transparent bodies due to load, unequal temperature, and 
set, while, still later, the youthful genius of Clerk-Maxwell supplied an algebraic 
solution for the stress distribution in any plate subjected to stresses in its own 
plane. 

The early history of the development of this branch of science is, in fact, 
remarkable for notable contributions at long intervals of time, and the almost 
complete disregard by engineers of its practical importance. 

The application of optical investigation to the determination of stress distri- 
bution in engineering structures and machines has, however, been hindered by 
causes which, although apparently insignificant, have been very real obstacles, 
and among these was the absence of a transparent material which could be 
fashioned into shapes suitable for investigating technical problems. It is not 
an easy matter, for example, to construct a glass model of a bridge free from 
internal stress, in the manner suggested by Brewster ; and, moreover, glass is 
extremely fragile iinder load, especially in cases where the stress distribution 
in it varies very much, while the cost of construction is very great. Happily 
tliere is now no necessity to emploj' glass for experimental investigation on 
engineering problems, since modern chemistry has supplied artificial bodies, such 
as the nitrocellulose compounds used for many trade purposes, which have 
optical properties very little inferior to glass, are able to bear great stresses 
without injury, and also are capable of being fashioned with the ease and cer- 
tainty of a wooden model. Photographic processes are also able to reproduce the 
brilliant colour effects caused by stress in transparent materials, so that per- 
manent records can now be made for future reference. 

The construction of polariscopes for examining models on a large scale is 
very essential for technical research, and the great scarcity of Iceland spar of 
sufficient purity and size for use as Nicol's prisms has caused much attention 
to be paid to the construction of apparatus for producing plane polarised light 
by the aid of sheets of glass. Fortunately this presents little difficulty, and 
although the light is not nearly so well polarised as that obtained from a Nicol's 
prism it is sufficiently so for the purpose. Large quarter-wave plates of mica 
have also been constructed by my colleague. Professor Silvanus Thompson, 
F.R.S., for obtaining circularly polarised light, and these have proved suffi- 
ciently exact and exceedingly useful for large models. 

It is of importance to show that the stress distribution revealed by a 
polarised beam of light passing through an elastic transparent material in no 
way differs from that obtained by other means, and evidence is available in 
modern researches, especially by Filon, that the experimental results obtained 
with glass agree with those of the theory of elasticity, while a satisfactory 
agreement of a similar kind has also been obtained with nitro-cellulose com- 
pounds, although not in so complete and direct a manner. Such an agreement 
may be expected on theoretical grounds, since the values of the elastic constants 
do not affect the fundamental equations for stresses in a plane, and although for 
three-dimensional stress the effect of the stretch-squeeze ratio causes .some 
difference, yet this is usually negligible. 

Most of the phj'sical constants of glass have been determined with very con- 
siderable accuracy, but other transparent substances have so far received little 
attention, and their optical constants are not well known. The stress-strain 
relations of glass and nitrocellulose have been determined with considerable 
accuracy, and a useful idea of their relation to metals may be gained from the 
values of the stretch-modulus, E, and the stretch-squeeze ratio, r. 

The accompanying table shows some average values for a few important 
materials, and it is of interest to note that the stretch-squeeze ratios of cast 
iron and plate-glass are very similar, while the values of the stretch modulus 
are nearly as three to two. These two materials also possess other like charac-

The high values of the stretch modulus for steel and wrought iron are not, 
apparently, approached by any transparent material having similar ductile pro- 
perties, but although nitro-cellulose has a stretch modulus of rather less than 
one-hundredth that of steel, its stress-strain properties are not unlike. In some 
recent experiments with a miniature testing machine fitted with an arrangement 
for recording the stress-strain relations of xylonite throughout the whole range 
of stress up to fracture, the main characteristics of steel appear on a very much 
reduced scale, and give additional confidence that the results of optical experi- 
ments on this material are applicable to metal structures. 

The complete analysis of stress distribution in a plate is not, however, a 
simple matter, and the analysis of Clerk-Maxwell was intended to provide a 
solution based on the properties of the isochromatic and isoclinic lines, coupled 
with the law that the optical effect is proportional to the difference of the 
principal stresses at a point, and to the thickness of the plate. 

A principal stress perpendicular to the bounding planes is assumed to have 
no oj)tical effect ; but since many cases have arisen where there are three principal 
stress components, it seemed desirable to examine such a case experimentally. 

It is a matter of some difficulty to arrange apparatus to stress a specimen in 
the direction of the incident beam, and at the same time observe the optical 
effect free from disturbing causes, since a transparent medium must be inter- 
posed for applying the required load, and this will be subject to stresses which 
may interfere with the optical effect on the specimen. 

Some observations on circular plates clamped at the edges and uniformly 
loaded over one face, showed that the bending stresses produced in the plate 
caused very little optical effect, since the tension and compression stresses 
neutralised one another, while the shear effects also appeared to be practically 
negligible. The only remaining stresses of importance were those caused by the 
clamping plates at the boundary, which produced radial and circumferential 
stresses having circular symmetry, and as the optical effects of these latter dis- 
appeared at a small distance from the edge, a field of view was obtained in which 
the optical effects of load applied perpendicularly to the plate were quite small, 
even when the internal stresses were very great. 

Two circular plates clamped together to enclose a space between them may 
therefore be -used as windows for observing the effect of a uniform pressure upon 
a transparent specimen, which latter may be a plate with its faces parallel to 
the end plates closing the chamber. If cubical compression is applied by a fluid, 
the principal stresses in the plane of the plate produce opposing optical effects, 
and any remaining effect is due to perpendicular pressures on the faces. The 
arrangement of experimental apparatus, therefore, took the form of a pair of 
transparent windows separated by an annular disc, and firmly clamped together 
by collars. The central chamber so formed was subjected to pressure of air, or 
other fluid, up to about one thousand pounds per square inch, and afterwards 
the specimen was introduced and the same pressure applied; but no visible 
change of effect could be observed. Finally, the specimen was set in the field 
of view outside the chamber, and pressure again applied by the fluid, but still 
no change was apparent. In all three cases the optical effects produced were 
small, and practically alike, so that the experimental evidence appears to warrant 
the conclusion that a principal stress in the direction of an incident beam of 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 495 

polarised light has no optical effect in a thin plate, or at any rate is so small 
that it may be neglected. 

That the retardation between the ordinary and extraordinary rays is pro- 
portional to the stress difference perpendicular to the incident beam within tlie 
elastic limit of the material may, therefore, be taken as reasonably accurate, 
although future research may show that it is only an approximation, or even 
that it is more accurate to commence from a fundamental strain equation ; but 
according to present knowledge there appears to be no warrant for such a 
procedure. 

A more pressing difficulty arises with regard to the optical constant connecting 
the wave-length retardation with the stress difference. The recent researches of 
Filon on glass show that the value of this constant is curiously dependent on the 
previous history of the material, especially as regards its heat treatment. Until 
further knowledge is gained on this matter it appears to be necessary to guard 
against errors in stress measurement from this cause by a careful selection and 
treatment of the material used, since for other artificial bodies we may find that 
the variation in the constant is not less in magnitude, and is at least as complex 
as in glass. In some instances the stress optical coefficient may be dispensed 
with, and Filon has shown, in cases where a theory of stress distribution has 
been worked out and it is desired to compare it with the results of optical 
measurements, that the isoclinic lines offer many advantages, since they are 
independent of photo-elastic constants, and the material need only be subjected 
to small stresses. 

The experimental analysis of stress distribution in a body depends on the 
possibility of finding the magnitudes and directions of the principal stresses at 
every point, and in practice it is found the simplest plan to determine the 
directions of stress from the lines of equal inclination obtained in plane 
polarised light, and to measure the stress difference by comparison with a wave- 
length standard, such as a Babinet compensator, or by comparison with a simple 
tension member set along one of the lines of principal stress, and loaded until 
the total effect produced is a dark field denoting a zero value. The difference 
of the principal stresses is then measured in terms of a simple tension. This 
alone is insufficient to determine the distribution, unless one of the principal 
stresses is zero, and, in general, another independent measure must be obtained. 
This is very conveniently supplied, as Mesnager suggested, by the change in the 
lateral dimensions of the plate under stress, since this change may be taken, in 
the absence of a third principal stress, as proportional to the generalised sum of 
the principal stresses throughout the thickness. 

The determination of the lateral strains in a comparatively thin plate, forming 
part of a model of a machine or structure, necessitates measurements of 
extremely minute linear quantities. If, for example, a plate of xylonite is 
taken, of the maximum thickness obtainable for optical work, a simple calcu- 
lation shows that these strains must be measured to an accuracy of one or two 
millionths of an inch. Several instruments have been designed and constructed 
for this purpose, to fulfil conditions which appear to be essential for successful 
use. It is necessary to avoid all chance of injury to the surface of a transparent 
material, so that the measuring points of an instrument can only be pressed 
lightly against the surfaces, and the weight must, therefore, be supported inde- 
pendently of the model. In instruments so far constructed, the measuring 
mechanism is carried on a U-shaped frame, for convenience of movement from 
point to point of the specimen. One measuring needle is secured and operated 
by a calibrating screw, and the other is free to move a multiplying lever system, 
and thereby tilt a mirror to give an angular deflection, which latter is calibrated 
by reference to the standard screw when the instrument has been finally secured 
in place. In recent work the labour of accurately setting the instrument in a 
number of different positions has proved so great, that my assistant, Mr. F. H. 
Withycombe, has designed a useful adjunct in the form of a mechanical slide- 
rest, to effect the required changes easily and expeditiously. In one arrange- 
ment, a bracket carries the measuring instrument on a three-point sup- 
port, and movement is effected by slides arranged to give displacements along 
three axes at right angles, and their amounts are measured by micrometer screws 
to an accuracy of rather less than one-thousandth of an inch. 



496 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G. 

These methods of stress determination avoid the difficulties of the Clerk- 
Maxwell analysis, which necessitates the determination of the equations to both 
families of isochromatic and isoclinic bands, usually a mathematical problem of 
considerable complexity. In some simple cases Mr. Scoble and I have verified 
the accuracy of the method of lateral measurements for determining the sum of 
the principal stresses, by comparing the calculated stresses with the experimental 
values obtained in a f)late of transparent material. We have lately carried these 
experiments a stage further, and have shown that the measured sums of the 
principal stresses in steel agree with the calculated values. This experimental 
solution, in fact, gives the stress at a point in a plate, if the conditions are those 
assumed by the mathematical case of a plate where generalised equations of 
stress apply. 

It is at once obvious, if the utility of experiments on models of this kind is 
admitted, that experimental evidence is available on a variety of practical 
engineering problems covering a very wide field of practice, not merely qualita- 
tive, but quantitative, and approximating to the needs of the physicist and 
mathematician, and well within the known variations of the materials with which 
the engineer has to deal in his daily practice. 

During the last few years much attention has been paid to the determination 
of the stresses in structural elements of primary importance, but only a small 
number of cases have been examined, since even the simplest problems have 
proved somewhat difficult, and much time and labour have been spent in per- 
fecting optical and mechanical appliances to suit the special conditions required 
for investigations on transparent models. A simple example of a case easily 
examined and of practical importance is that of a tension member subjected to 
an eccentric load. The optical effects here show a linear distribution of stress 
due to the combination of direct pull and bending, -while the neutral axis moves 
towards the tension side as the stress increases. Not only can these effects be 
measured, but if the specimen begins to fail some indication is obtained of the 
way in which the stress distribution is changed to meet the new conditions, and 
there is found a tendency to an equalisation of tJie maximum stress at the 
boundary, although at present the form of the curve of distribution beyond the 
elastic limit is largely conjectural. 

A case like that of a very short member subjected to direct compression is 
also not without interest, partly because it reveals unexpected difficulties. In 
the first place it is not easy to apply a pure compression stress, and if the sur- 
faces in contact are not of the same materials it appears to be practically im- 
possible, since the lateral changes are unlike, and shear stress is therefore 
produced at the plane of the surfaces in contact. In a short member this shear 
has a very important influence, and by interposing a thin layer of a material, 
such as india-rubber, between the pressure plates and the short transparent block, 
the artificial shear effect produced by the india-rubber is easily shown to in- 
fluence the distribution throughout, and to increase the stress in a very marked 
way. Expei'iments on transparent materials show that the increase of stress may 
be twenty per cent, or even more. Such an effect is known to take place when 
cubes of stone are crushed between lead plates, and optical investigations on 
models have enabled a quantitative measure of the effect to be ascertained in 
this and other cases, thereby confirming the theoretical investigations of Filon 
on the distribution of stress in such members under various practical systems of 
loading. 

The local effects produced near the points of application of a load are usually 
of considerable importance, and their influence on the stress distribution in 
beams has been examined by Carus-Wilson. 

The stress effects produced by discontinuities in materials is also of con- 
siderable interest, and the cases arising from the necessities of construction are 
infinite in their variety. 

The practical importance of an accurate knowledge of the change in stress 
distribution produced by changes of section in a member is so thoroughly appre- 
ciated that it needs no insistence, and it has received much attention from a 
mathematical point of view. Thus the local effect of a spherical cavity in a 
member subjected to uniform tension or compression load has been shown by 
Love to double the intensity very nearly, while Kirsch has shown that a small 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 497 

cylindrical hole in a tension member trebles the stress intensity. If the hole 
is elliptical the increase of stress may be still greater, and Inglis has shown, 
among other interesting cases, that if the minor axis of the ellipse is parallel 
to the direction of the applied load in a tension member, the stress intensity 
is increased by an amount measured by twice the ratio of the axis of the ellipse. 

A crack, considered as the limiting case of an elliptical hole, is thus seen to 
give extremely great stresses at the ends, tending towards infinite values for 
an extremely fine crack. 

Optical experiments afford an independent means of examining the alterations 
of stress intensity produced by discontinuities, and the results are found to agree 
remarkably well with those obtained from the theory of elasticity. The stress at 
the boundary of a small cylindrical hole in a plate has been found to be almost 
exactly three times the stress in the full plate, and the effects of holes com- 
parable with the width of the tension member have also been examined in some 
detail. 

In the case of a rivet just filling the hole and exerting no tangential effect 
at the boundary, there is a lessened tension stress across the minimum section 
at the boundary hole, accompanied by a marked radial tension. These effects have 
been recently confirmed in a mathematical discussion by Suyehiro. Other cases 
give satisfactory agreement with calculation, and we may therefore feel some 
confidence that experimental investigation will prove useful in some of the very 
complicated cases arising out of engineering practice where analysis is difficult, 
if not impossible. 

The effects of overstress in materials may also be examined by optical means, 
and although the laws relating to stress distribution in overstressed transparent 
material are not known, the general effects observed in simple cases are fairly 
evident. If, for example, a tension memb'er of glass is stressed, there is no 
ductile yielding of the material, and the stress will therefore rise very rapidly 
at the boundary of a small hole, and fracture will therefore occur with a 
moderate load. If, however, a ductile transparent material is employed, and 
the material shows signs of failure at the hole, the break-down of the structure 
.'spreads outwards as the load is increased, until we may have a condition in "which 
within the elastic limit the curve of stress intensity at the minimum section 
accords with calculation, but at the overstressed part the stress tends to equalise, 
and the curve of intensity tends to become horizontal near the hole. The mean 
value of this part of the stress distribution may be inferred from the difference 
between the total load and the measured values below the region of failure; 
but the true distribution of the overstress has not been accurately determined, so 
that the shape of this peak is lai'gely conjectural. 

The effects of groups of rivets such as occur in bridges, boilers, and struc- 
tural members of all kinds, afford ample scope for further inquiry; but before 
more exact knowledge can be gained of the condition of stress in a complicated 
riveted joint it appears necessary to examine thoroughly the very simple cases. 

Mr. 8coble and I have examined the case of the load applied by one rivet to 
a plate with various amounts of overlap, and the stresses around the rivet holes 
have been measured with fair accuracy. 

Other interesting cases of discontinuity in structure arc afforded by the 
engine hatchways, gun-turrets, tunnel openings, and the like, in ships' decks, and 
some progress in this direction has been made by experiments on model decks, 
subjected to loads like those produced when a vessel meets the waves due to a 
head sea. 

Even if the utility of transparent models is left out of account, it is generally 
acknowledged that many engineering problems are often simplified by the use of 
models of machines and structures on a small scale, where circumstances forbid 
experimental examination of the actual work. No defence of their use is, I 
think, necessary, since the employment of models is a characteristic feature of 
British methods, not limited to engineers. Kelvin did not disdain their use, and 
his successors, who have done so much to advance knowledge of the ether and the 
atomic dust, have freely employed their great ingenuity in the construction of 
mechanical models and diagrams to explain their views, as in the Lodge cog-wheel 
diagrams of the ether, the planetary systems of atoms of J. J. Thomson and 
Rutherford, and the grouping of elements by Soddy.

Engineers have not the same great difficulties which confront those who are 
advancing the boundaries of pure science ; their models are very much what they 
please to make them ; but, even then, problems arise which are sufficiently difficult 
to tax all the resources of applied science. The behaviour of models considered 
as similar structures is, therefore, a subject which engineers are bound to inves- 
tigate in order to determine the effects of fixed and moving loads, the action of 
wind, the pressure and frictional effects of steam and other fluids, and many 
other problems. 

In the majority of cases the simplest and the most direct method is the 
experimental study of a model, from which to obtain the data required for 
calculating effects on a full-sized structure, and hence the laws of similarity have 
received a very close scrutiny. 

Although most valuable information can be obtained from models, their use- 
fulness is clearly limited. The effects of the dead weight of a structure are pro- 
portional to the cube of the linear dimensions, and are, therefore, not usually 
measurable on a model except in exceptional circumstances, as, for instance, 
where elastic jellies are employed, as in the well-known investigations of Pearson 
on the stress distribution in reservoir dams. Nor are questions of stability easy 
to solve, since the forces producing instability are proportional to the size of the 
model. On the other hand, stress effects due to applications of load may be 
measured by the strains produced in a model of the same material, if the loads 
are proportional to the squares of the linear dimensions. The effects of applied 
load are studied even better in a model constructed of transparent material, since 
the variation of stress from point to point can be studied with much greater ease 
and certainty. 

As detailed models of this latter kind present some variations from the usual 
laws of similarity, it may be of interest to indicate their nature. Questions of 
deformation clearly involve the elastic constants of the transparent material and 
their relation to those of the proposed structure, while stress distribution in the 
solid is influenced by the value of Poisson's ratio. This latter effect is quite 
small for glass, but may become appreciable with other substance. It is 
negligible in a model of any material which approximates to a thin plate stressed 
by forces in its own plane. 

The optical effects for any given load are, moreover, independent of the thick- 
ness of the material, and depend upon the stress difference, so that colour effects 
are obtained which may be regarded as pictures of shear stress throughout the 
model. Modern researches on ductile materials like structural steel indicate that 
such materials fail at some limiting value of shearing stress, and since the places 
where these limiting values are reached in the model are visible to the eye, the 
weak places in the design of a structure can be ascertained and a faulty design 
corrected by purely experimental means. 

In this connection it is of interest to mention that M. Mesnager, the chief 
engineer of bridges and roads to the French Government, has recently constructed 
an elaborate model in glass of a design for an arched bridge of about 310 feet 
span. This investigation was considered advisable for a work of this magnitude 
constructed of reinforced concrete, in order to check the calculations, especially 
of maximum stresses in the arched ribs, which latter were assumed to be fixed at 
the ends. 

The effects of reinforcements were allowed for by determining equivalent 
sections of glass for the members of the model. Many difficulties had to be over- 
come in the production of a model free from optical defects, but these were all 
successfully surmounted. The stresses in the model were determined by aid of a 
Babinet compensator, and formed a valuable check upon the calculations for a 
structure of this great magnitude and somewhat unusual design. 

In this brief and incomplete account of a small branch of applied science 
relating to engineering the fundamental importance of discoveries in pure science 
is manifest. 

The discoveries in pure science and their innumerable applications to practical 
ends are ever a potent factor working for the common good, and the value which 
the British Association places upon applied science was most cordially voiced by 
Professor Bateson in his Portsmouth Address when he said : ' To the creation of 
applicable science the very highest gifts and training are well devoted,' and. 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 499 

' The man who devotes liis life to applied science should be made to feel that ho 
is in the main stream of scientific progress. If he is not, both his work and 
science at large will suffer. The opportunities of discovery are so few that we 
cannot afford to miss any, and it is to the man of trained mind, who is in contact 
with the phenomenon of a great applied science, that such opportiinities are most 
often given '; and, again, ' If we are to progress fast there must be no separation 
between pure and applied science. The practical man with his wide knowledge of 
specific natural facts, and the scientific student ever seeking to find the hard 
general truths which the diversity of Nature hides — truths out of which any 
lasting structure of progress must be built — have everything to gain from free 
interchange of experience and ideas.' 

Engineers who are more immediately concerned with the problems of directing 
the great sources of power in Nature for the use and convenience of man are 
indeed grateful to our President for these inspiring words, and trust that the ties 
•which unite investigators in pure and applied science will never slacken, but will 
knit together more closely for a joint advance to a more perfect understanding 
and utilisation of the laws of Nature.

and cost of working of English railways were shown on the screen. The question 
of motive-power was then considered and the advantages of the locomotive and

3. A Transmission System suitable for Heavy Internal- Combustion 
Locomotives.^ By Hedley J. Thomson, Assoc. M. Inst. C E., 
M.I.E.E. 

The author pointed out that the slow progress made in the use of internal- 
combustion engines for heavy traction has been due to the want of suitable 
variable-speed control mechanism. He enumerated four types of variable-speed 
gear, and gave in detail, with diagrams, a technical description of the Thomas 
electro-mechanical transmission, which is put forward as the most suitable for the 
class of work referred to. With this system, so long as the prime mover, when in 
direct drive, can overcome the resistance encountered, the transmission is direct 
and altogether mechanical. At all other times the power of the prime mover is 
divided by means of planetary gearing into two parts, one portion being applied 
to the load by electrical means and the other mechanically. The electric trans- 
mission ensures that ease of control characteristic of all electrical drives and yet 
owing to the large proportion of the total power transmitted mechanically, the 
system is not subject to the heavy losses unavoidable with a sy.'^tem whnllv

1. The Behaviour of Metals under Strain. 
By Walter Eosenhain, B.A., D.Sc, F.R.S. 

For a rational understanding of the behaviour of metals under strain the 
truly crystalline character of all metals and alloys in their normal (cast or 
annealed) state is of fundamental importance. Evidence for this fundamental 
proposition is readily obtained by the microscope in a variety of ways, including 
the development of 'etch figures,' 'negative crystals,' and the 'oriented lustre' 
of crystalline aggregates. The manner in which a crystalline aggregate is formed 
when a material undergoes solidification by a process of dendritic crystallisation 
such as is typical in metals is illustrated by the building up of aggregates of 
cubical blocks, a process which is shown by the aid of the cinematograph. By 
the same means the behaviour of etched metal surfaces under oblique light is 
demonstrated. The behaviour of crystals and of a crystalline aggregate under 
plastic deformation is next considered, and the manner in which a crystal can 
undergo deformation by a process of slip on its cleavage or gliding planes is 
explained and illustrated by the cinematograph, a summary of the evidence upon 
which our present knowledge of the true nature of plastic deformation is based 
being given and illustrated. 

The more detailed and difficult questions connected with the deformation and 
fracture of metals which have received increasing attention recently are next 
considered, including such phenomena as ' fatigue,' testing by, and failure under, 
shock or repeated impact, and the phenomena of semi-plasticity and elastic 
recovery. The behaviour of metals at high temperatures is also discussed, and the 
explanation of these phenomena afforded by the modern development of the theory 
of an amorphous phase in metals, as originated by Beilby and extended by the 
author and his collaborators, is summarised.

means of microphotography has steadily developed during the last few years. 
The author has recently applied a photographic method for obtaining a record 
of the relation between the load and extension of metals right up to the break- 
ing point. The diagrams taken in this way show very clearly the peculiarities 
of the metals at their yield points, and also the load actually on the specimen 
at the moment of fracture. The combination of the two methods offers a 
promising field for research. Some photographic records and microphotographs 
were exhibited on the screen.

each lift 40 million gallons per day to a height of 30 feet ; and the scheme for 
draining Lake Mareotis now being carried out for the Egyptian Government at 
Mex, near Alexandria, where eighteen pumps are ultimately to be installed, each 
capable of lifting 100 million gallons per day to a height of 20 feet. 



4. The Stress Distribution in Short Compression Members. 
By Professors Coker and Filon. 

Short compression members are occasionally used for constructive purposes 
but more especially for tests on materials like brick, stone, and concrete, which 
are almost invariably used in compression. In all such cases the mode of 
application of the load is an important factor, and its influence on the stress- 
distribution is known to be great. 

This is recognised in the testing of engineering materials, and care is taken 
to ensure as uniform a distribution of load as possible over the end faces of the 
loaded member. Occasionally these faces are ground to approximately true 
planes by means of emery wheels or the like, in order to obtain a uniformly even 
bearing, and when the size or material of the specimen makes this impracticable 
the specimen is often faced with plaster of Paris for the same purpose. 

A convenient method of investigating the stress at any point of a short com- 
pression member of rectangular section is afforded by the optical effects pro- 
duced in a transparent model, combined with mechanical measurements of the 
lateral changes produced by the load. 

In the experiments described in the paper a special form of compression- 
testing-machine was used, having one fixed pressure-plate, while the other has a 
slight frictionless movement in the direction of application of the load, and this 
latter is weighed by a system of levers. Experiment shows that a block of 
transparent material subjected to compression between steel or brass jilates is 
never uniformly loaded owing to tangential stress at the planes of contact pro- 
duced by the lateral changes of the two different materials. If a very exten- 
sible material is interposed between the specimen and the pressure-plates of the

stress distribution in various cases were described and compared.

1. Tlie Dynamic Incremoit of a Single Rolling Load on a Supported 
Beani.^ By Professor H. Chatley, B.Sc. 

The author suggested the use of the following foi-mula for the dynamic 
increment of a single concentrated rolling load on a beam supported at both ends, 
the load being at the centre, 



-"D-f"']

He showed that this is a close approximation to the solution of a complex 
differential equation which states the conditions of dynamic equilibrium in the 
given case. 

The dynamic increment is due to the vertical accelerations experienced by the 
load as the result of the deflection of the beam, and is of course liable to a 
' compomid interest ' effect. The latter will not ordinarily more than double the 
effect due to the static deflection alone. 

SF = the dynamic increment of the load W. 
V = the horizontal velocity of the load. 
L = the span of the beam. 

E = the modulus of elasticity of the material of the beam. 
I=the moment of inertia of the beam section, assumed constant. 
g = the gravitational acceleration. 
c = WV=L/gEI. 



2. The Change in the Modulus of Elasticity and of other Properties of 
Metals loith Temperature.- By Professor F. 0. Lea, D.Sc, and 
0. H. Crowther, M.Sc. 

The paper described experiments that had been carried out to determine the 
influence of temperature, varying from 15° C. to 650° C, on some of the 
properties of metals. The specimens were heated in an electrically heated fur- 
nace, the temperature of which could be maintained nearly constant for some 
hours, and were loaded by means of a horizontal hydraulic-lever testing machine. 
The form of the specimens and the arrangements used for connecting them to the 
shackles of the machine and also a special extensometer were described. Tem- 
peratures were determined by iron-constantin thermo-couples. The effect of 
temperature on the breaking stress, yield point, construction of area, elongation 
per cent., and the modulus of elasticity of mild steel and other metals was shown 
by curves plotted from the results of the experiments. The modulus of elasticity 
of mild steel was shown to vary from 13,000 tons to 6,000 tons per square inch 
as the temperature varied from 15° C. to 630° C. The breaking stress of mild 
steel as measured on the original area was shown to be a maximum at about 
250° C, but the stress obtained by dividing the breaking load by the fractured 
area was a minimum at this temperature. The modulus of elasticity of micro 
copper was shown to change from 5,100 tons per square inch to 3,270 tons per 
.square inch as the temperature varied from 15° C. to 6.50° C.

After the President had delivered his Address (see p. 490) the following 
Papers were read : — 

1. Irrigation in New South Wales. By A. B. Wade. 



2. Irrigation in Lybia. 
By Professor Luigi Luiggi, D.Sc, M.Inst.C.E. 

The paper -was prefaced by a general survey of the many works of general 
economic importance undertaken in Lybia — that is, the region round Tripoli and 
Bengasi — since its occupation less than three years ago by Italy. All these 
works are arranged according to a plan prepared by Professor Luiggi in view of 
the future development of agriculture in Tripolitania and Cyrenaica, not only as 
it must have been in Roman times, but as it can be further improved by modern 
implements and methods of cultivation, with the assistance of scientific 
irrigation. 

Tripolitania, for the most part, is a flat country, slightly elevated above sea- 
level, with a hot and dry climate, and a scanty rainfall during the winter 
months and totally absent for two-thirds of the year, ranging from about 
20 inches near the coast to 10 inches near the table-lands, and disappearing 
altogether further inland. The soil within the line of the 15 inches rainfall 
is sandy, but adapted to the culture of cereals of rapid growth, and for breeding 
sheep and especially goats. The rainy season is from November to February, 
and with proper cultivation — thanks to the abundance of sunshine even in winter 
— a good crop can be raised, ready to be harvested in March or April. Then 
begins the hot, dry season, and, where there is no irrigation, everything 
dries up. 

Cyrenaica is rather a plateau-land, .some 2,500 feet above sea-level, very 
undulating, with a milder climate and a rainfall of from 15 to 30 inches, so 
that ordinary crops, fruit trees, olives, vines, etc., can grow; besides date-palm 
trees, which form an important item in the agriculture of Lybia. But then the 
summer months are hot and dry, and unless some sort of watering is applied to 
certain classes of trees, many would die, especially in years of drought. 

Thus practically the future development of Lybia depends more or less on 
irrigation. At present irrigation, as practised by the natives, is very rudimentary, 
but most ingenious. Owing to the great permeability of the soil there are no 
running streams in Lybia — or, at least, they may run occasionally, but only for a 
few hours after a cloud-burst. All the water passes rapidly into the subsoil 
and has to be raised from wells by means of buckets operated by camels ; and 
thus only limited zones near the coast — where the surface is nearer to the water- 
plane — can be irrigated with profit. A very clever artifice is adopted to reduce 
evaporation. For this purpose on the same area to be irrigated are grown first 
palm trees, which form a sort of sunshade and a protection for the successive 
growth of orange or other fruit trees, which in turn shelter the plants to be 
grown on the surface, such as ordinary vegetables or lucerne, and to these the 
irrigation water is directly applied. In this way excess of .sunshine and of 
ventilation are avoided and evaporation from the soil reduced to a minimum. 
At the same time three different crops are grown on the same plot of land, 
which is thus utilised to the fullest extent. 

This method of irrigation, which is practised also in some parts of Sicily 
and must be of Roman origin, can be applied only to limited zones and where 
the water-plane is not more than 20 to 30 feet below the surface. 

For irrigation on a larger scale, as there are no superficial streams, it is 
necessary to collect the rainfall from the mountain-sides and store it up in 
artificial lakes formed by dams. This was practised by the Romans, and we 
find in Lybia the ruins of many masonry dams and cisterns, some of which are 
being restored and will soon be again in working order. In the meantime some 
more important reservoirs are being considered and will soon be started. They

will be formed by rock-fill dams, which are the best adapted for the natural 
conditions of the country, where labour is scarce and inefficient, good materials 
rare, and earth tremors rather frequent. 

Bock-fiU Dams. — The rock-fill dams can be built almost entirely by mechanical 
implements served by a few good workmen, and if the slopes do not exceed about 
30 degrees the dam can resist any shock of earthquake without great damage, 
and in any case repairs are easy. This type of dam is very common in the 
Western States of America, and has been adopted with success also in Italy in 
the valleys of Cenischia, Biaschina, and Devero. 

A special feature of the new reservoirs will be the ' automatic syphon-spill- 
ways " ap])lied by Mr. Gregotti to many dams and canals both in Italy and else- 
where. It consi.sta of a tube in the shape of a syphon, generally of square 
section, made of ferro-concrete, and capable of discharging from 1 to 15 cubic 
metres (525 cubic feet) per second, according to section and head, and if larger 
discharges are necessary then several syphons are distributed side by side up to 
ten. As soon as the water in the reservoir exceeds by 2 or 3 inches the normal 
level, the syphon is automatically primed, owing to the special conformation of 
its toji-lip, and begins to act with full discharge till the level in the reservoir is 
lower than the lip of the syphon, when air gets in and the flow ceases. 

The velocity of the water in the syphon is that due to the difference of level 
from the reservoir and the outlet of the syphon, and thus is greater, and tlie 
discharge is correspondingly greater, than in an ordinary overfall-spillway, where 
the velocity is due to the more limited head between the level in the reservoir 
and the sill of the spillway. 

At equal discharge the syphon-spillway works better and costs much less than 
the usual overfall-spillway. 

For example, in the Lagolungo reservoir near Genoa, the old overflow-spill- 
way required a head of l-40m. of water (-1' 8'') and a volume of 440.000 cubic 
metres of water (more than 15 million cubic feet) ran to waste over the spill- 
way after a storm had passed. A battery of ten .syphons, each with an internal 
square section of l-90m. (6' 4" by G' 4") and a working head of 5-75m. 
(IS/ S"), was substituted to the old spillway, capable of discharging 150 cubic 
metres per second (5,2.50 cubic feet) ; at the same time allowing the sill to be 
raised by 095 (3 feet), by which an extra volume of 300,000 cubic metres of 
water (10| million cubic feet) are impounded. 

Besides, it was proved that the syphons give the discharge of 150 cm. with 
only 4 inches of super-elevation of the water over the lip, or with an elevation 
of 14 inches less than before, when the overfall-spillway was used, thus reducing 
correspondingly the water-pressure against the dam. 

The greater volume of 300,000 cubic metres of water thus impounded repre- 
sents an income of at least 15,000 francs (600Z.), a year, and, capitalised at 5 per 
cent., a total of 300,000 francs (12,000Z.), equal to at least six times the cost of 
the new syphon-spillway ; which, moreover, is more compact and moi'e efficient. 
Of these automatic syphon-spillways there are more than 100 on Italian dams 
and canals, with heads varying from 3 to 20 feet, and all give complete 
satisfaction. 

The author exhibited several views of ruins of Roman works, and a cinema- 
film showing the method of constructing the railway and the striking difference 
in the zones cultivated with and without iirigation. 



.']. Iiivestigalian of Nile Paver Flood Record from .a.d. 641 to a.d. 1451 
for Traces of Periodicity. By T. W. Keele, M.Inst.C.E. 

The author was led into this investigation when examining records of rain- 
fall at various places, particularly those of the Commonwealth of Australia, 
with a view to ascertaining whether periodicity exists. 

The results of previous study of this meteorological question were given by 
the author in a paper entitled ' The Great Weather Cycle,' read before the Royal 
Society of New South Wales on July 1, 1910, and published in their Proceedings 
(see volume xliv., pages 25 to 76), in which he sought to show that the period 
must be a long one. He was of opinion that the defects which were apparent in 



506 TRA&gt;S ACTIONS OF SECTION S. 

the comparatively short period of nineteen years, so ably advocated by the late 
Mr. H. C. Russell, Government Astronomer of New South Wales, disappeared 
when testing multiples of that period, and that fifty-seven years more correctly 
represented the true period in Australia. It was, however, ascertained from a 
curve computed from tihe record of the Nile floods, which were at that time 
available, namely from A.D. 1736 to a.d. 1905, that the Nile's period would 
appear to be either 114 or 171 years. 

These conclusions were based on the results arrived at by discarding the old 
system of plotting the rises or falls above or below an arithmetical mean of 
the figures constituting the record, and adopting a system which would sihow the 
cum.ulative effect of the departures from the mean. Slow, persistent rises or 
falls which are not discernible under the old system are immediately detected 
by this method. 

The Nile's period then arrived at was so long that it extended far beyond 
the limits of all rainfall records, except, perhaps, that of British rainfall, com- 
piled by the late Mr. Symons, F.R.S., and the Paris and Padua records, all 
three of which are more or less unreliable. There was consequently no means 
of proving its reliability or otherwise unless by comparing it with tables of 
historical events, which was hardly admissible in an investigation of this nature. 

Fortunately the records of the height of the annual flood on the Nile from 
the years a.d. 641 to a.d. 1451 have recently been made available. In his letter 
to the author, forwarding a copy of this historical record, Mr. J. I. Craig, M.A., 
F.R.'S.E., Director Meteorological Service, Cairo, stated that, although there 
is internal evidence of clerical errors in the Arabic records from which he 
extracted the gauge readings, on the whole he believes them to be trustworthy. 

With this assurance the author computed a series of residual mass curves 
derived from the means of most of the periods which have been propounded from 
time to time. None of these were satisfactory, with the exception of the curve 
derived from the means of successive complete periods of 76 years, of which 
there are ten altogether out of the whole record of 810 years. 

An inspection of the diagram will show tihat the conformation to a 76 years' 
period is very remarkable, even when this period is extended up to the present 
time. Notwithstanding that there are two breaks in the records from 1451 to 
1825 of 285 and 25 years, respectively, the curve derived from the recent records 
still shows a similar conformation. 

From an historical point of view the diagram is an extremely interesting one. 
It represents the longest continuous record in the world. The dry and wet 
periods are clearly defined, ranging from nineteen to fifty-seven years of 
accumulated rise or fall with reference to the mean. 

The author was severely criticised during the discussion on his paper of 
July 1, 1910, previously referred to, for seeming to connect Halley's comet in 
some way with ' the weather.' This was because he had drawn attention to the 
fact that the comet's mean period was approximately 76 years, and also that its 
appearance seemed to occur during periods of great drought. 

The position of the comet at the time of its perihelion passage is shown on the 
diagram on fourteen occasions from information kindly supplied by Mr. C. I. 
Merfield, F.R.A.S. It will be seen that in almost every instance the comet made 
its appearance during the periods of greatest drought in Egypt. 



4. Imperial College of Science and Teclviologij : The Goldsmiths' Com- 
pany's Extension of the City and Guilds (Engineering) College. By 
Professor W. E. Dalby, F.R.S., M.Inst.C.E. 

This paper gave a concise history of the development of the City and 
Guilds (Engineering) College. The College was founded by the City and 
Guilds of London Institute in 1884, and its federation with the Imperial 
College of Science and Technology took place in 1907. In 1885 there were 35 
students in attendance; last session (1912-13) there were 570. 

After referring to previous extensions the paper gave a detailed account 
of the present engineering extension, named after the Goldsmiths' Company, 
who have undertaken to defray the cost of erection. This extension includes 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G. 507 

the following laboratories on the ground floor : a top-lighted laboratory, a rail- 
way laboratory, a hydraulic laboratory, and also a boiler-room. 

The top-lighted laboratory consists of four bays, having a total floor area 
of 17,(528 square feet. The floor is of timber decking, supported on steel 
girders and brick columns. Underneath is a basement of equal area, in which 
all mains, pipes, cables, countershafts, &amp;c., are placed. Machinery can there- 
fore be installed without any structural alterations being made necessary. 
Steam is supplied from the boiler-room adjoining. A five-ton travelling crane 
is fitted to each bay of the laboratory. 

The railway laboratory has a floor-area of 3,200 square feet. A portion of 
the laboratory has been designed as a wind-flume capable of producing a current 
of air of sixty miles per hour, the object being to ascertain the effect of wind- 
pressure on train-models, aeroplane-wings, and structures. 

The hydraulic laboratory has a total floor-area of about 8,000 square feet. 
The equipment of the laboratory consists chiefly of supply tanks, measuring 
apparatus (including a standardising tank of 12,500 gallons capacity), weir- 
boxes, a west sump and an east sump (the latter having a capacity of 22,000 
gallons) connected by flumes, a complete turbine plant, and two Gwynne pumps, 
as well as a twelve-inch Venturi meter, and mains and piping. The chief 
feature of the design of the laboratory is that the power to be supplied for the 
circulation of the water through the equipment has only to overcome the 
frictional resistance of a vertical lift, and is therefore at a minimum; the whole 
circulation can be controlled by one man standing at the pumps ; and experi- 
ments with the different apparatus can take place independently and simul- 
taneously. 

The boiler-room contains two Lancashire boilers and one water-tube boiler, 
each capable of giving 5,000 lbs. of steam per hour, arranged so that they can be 
available for experimental purposes. Underneath the roadway behind the 
boiler-room are the coal-bunkers, capable of holding a hundred tons of coal, as 
well as an ash-pit from which the ashes can be hoisted through a trap-door and 
emptied directly into the carts. 

The paper concluded with some particulars of the advanced courses in the 
Imperial College, showing that the objects of its founders have already been 
successfully carried out. The College is still rapidly developing, and will 
soon provide every facility for post-graduate study and research for students 
from all the colleges of Greater Britain. 



TUESDAY, AUGUST 25. 
The Section divided into two Sub-Sections, G I. and G II. 
In Sub-Section G I. the following Papers were read : — 

1. The Metropolitan Electric Railways proposed for Sydney. 
By J. J. C. Beadfield, M.Inst.G.E. 

The paper described the proposed scheme for which Parliamentary sanction 
is being sought. It comprises the construction of an underground railway in 
the City itself, and the electrification of some of the suburban railways to 
connect up with the underground railway. Statistics show that the present 
railway and tramway systems are, or will shortly be, incapable of handling the 
rapidly increasing traffic. It is proposed to connect North Sydney and the 
City by means of a bridge across the harbour, while another bridge would 
connect the City with the western suburb of Balmain. It was maintained that 
a bridge would be cheaper than a subway, and would give better gradients and 
greater comfort. Since Sydney is the fifth port in the Empire, it is essential 
that the fairway be not impeded. For this reason the proposed harbour bridge 
crosses in a single span of 1,600 feet, with a headway of 170 feet above high- 
water. It provides for four lines of railway, beside vehicular and passenger 
traflio. The design and material are discussed, and a nickel-steel cantilever 
bridge is recommended, at an estimated cost of 2,600,000/. Details were given 



508 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G. 

of the proposed underground railways, location of stations, junctions, schedules, 
fares, &amp;c. It is proposed to employ continuous current at 1,500 volts, supplied 
from overhead conductors. 

A short description was given of the power station already in course of 
construction at White Bay, Balmain, for the tramways, which, like the rail- 
ways, belong to the Government. The station will be capable of developing 
100,000 h.p., and will supply the power required for the proposed railway 
system. 

The total cost of the whole scheme is estimated at 17,000,000?. 



2. Australian Ports in relation to Modern Ships and Skipping. 
By W. E. Adams, A.M.lnst.G.E. 

The enormous increase in the size of ships trading to Australia during the 
last fifteen years has set a problem to the Port Authorities of Australia that 
calls for careful consideration. It has become very desirable to review the 
position not only from the standpoint of the Harbour Authorities, but also from 
that of the local commercial interests involved. That the civil engineer can 
always rise to the occasion and provide for an)thing the shipbuilder can pro- 
duce is evidenced by such works as the Suez and Panama Canals. But, as 
engineering practically conceived cannot be divorced from economics, especially 
in a young and growing country like Australia, where much money is required 
for numerous lines of development, the engineer must be a rigid economist. On 
this account, it is advisable carefully to examine the situation that is arising 
in its most general aspect. 

Privately-owned wharfage in the chief commercial sea-ports of Australia 
has almost disappeared. Public ownership of the foreshores has been rendered 
necessary in order that wharfage may be planned in conjunction with other great 
public utilities, such as railways, tramways, roads of access, and to admit of 
the segregation of berthage into mail and passenger, general cargo, frozen meat, 
grain, coal, and other specialities. 

Clearly it is necessary to separate the shipment of frozen meat and grain 
from coal and other dirty or noxious cargoes, while passenger and mail services 
should berth as close to the heart of the city as possible. Where these essentials 
are laid out in advance contingent municipalities are enabled to co-operate to 
advantage, and private industries immediately connected with shipping can 
be established in the most suitable positions. 

Thus it has come about that all the Australian capital sea-ports except 
Brisbane have been placed under public trusts, of various constitutions, but 
all aiming at the one object, namely, to provide for the shipping on a compre- 
hensive scale, and on a self-supporting basis. In the endeavour to keep pace 
with shipping developments the cost of the modern sea-port has become, and 
promises to become in the future, a still more important commercial factor. 
Port-dues already amount in many cases to 10 per cent, of the freight charges. 

In ocean transport three separate interests are involved. Firstly, there is 
the private shipowner, who invests for personal profit ; secondly, the Port 
Authorities, who build usually to meet expenses of maintenance, interest, and 
sinking fund (though sometimes more is required) ; and thirdly, the merchant 
or shipper, who ships goods. 

To Australia, which is a large exporter and importer, and, moreover, a 
country greatly in need of population, it is obviously important that oversea 
freights, fares, and other charges should be as low as possible, on accomit of 
the immense distance from the centre of civilisation. The point of supreme 
interest to Australia in this connection lies in the question as to whether 
modern shipping developments tend to increase or to decrease the total cost 
of ocean transport. 

It is unquestionable that cargo and passengers can be carried more cheaply 
in large than in small steamers. That is, the cost per ton-mile, reckoning 
working expenses, including coal, wages, and upkeep, are less per ton carried 
in large than in small steamers. By way of illustration, Sir W. White in 
1903 quoted the case of the P. and 0. Company's Moldavia, 10,000 tons, stating 
that an increase in draft of three feet would increase her freight-earning 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION O. 509 

(iipafity liy Ou per cent., wliile no appret iable loss of speed would ensno. Tliis 
is, of course, very important to tiie shipowners, but the economics of ocean 
transport are not affected thereby unless some at least of this saving is passed 
on by shipowner to shipper, and ultimately to the producer. Naturally some 
reasonable advantage must be permitted to the shipowner, otherwise he woulil 
not build large ships, but, to place the matter on a true economic basis, it has 
yet to be shown that the shipper and the producer share in the saving. If 
not, then the big ship mnst rely upon other grounds of justification, and, as 
we shall see, these may not be lacking. 

The next point for consideration is the eftert of big ships upon the cost of 
port and harbour works to accommodate them. Conditions vary so much 
between the ports of Australia that the total increased outlay per berth, includ- 
ing the necessary dredging, coidd only be considered for each port in detail. 
Thus, at Sydney and Hobart, the matter would be practically narrowed down 
to the actual increased cost of the new over the old class of berth, the dredging 
being practically a negligible quantity ; while at Melbourne and Brisbane the 
deepening and dredging would be heavy items. The natural physical difficulties 
of these two ports must, therefore, exercise a limiting influence on the size of 
ships trading to Australia for some time to come. Brisbane, being the only 
possible outlet for a vast and productive hinterland, will surely develop rapidly 
into a very large and important shipping centre, probably in time rivalling 
the southern ports. 

To meet the increase in the size of ships the Port Authorities of Australia 
find themselves called upon to spend very large sums of money in reconstruction. 
Wharves and jetties that sufficed twelve or fifteen years ago are now all obsolete. 
Upon the cost of replacement planned on a vastly larger scale, maintenance, 
interest, and sinking funds have to be provided for out of the port-dues. It 
seems inevitable that the port-dues must tend to increase. It is not overlooked 
that modern appliances and large vessels will allow more cargo to be handled 
at a berth Ihan formerly; but, on the otTier hand, when a small number of very 
large ships replaces a large number of small ones, berths are apt to have longer 
periods of idleness, and would, therefore, not be made the fullest use of. 

The situation will be better understood by a comparison of the berths of 
fifteen years ago at the port of Sydney with those of to-day. Up to the year, 
say, 1900, the largest oversea vessels trading to this port averaged some 6,000 
tons, and the inter-state vessels 3,000 tons. The lengths of the former ran from 
430 feet to 470 feet, by 50 feet to 53 feet beam ; and of the latter from 300 feet 
to 350 feet, by 40 feet to 46 feet beam. For vessels of this class there were a 
number of berths consisting of frontage wharves and jetties from 300 feet to 
4.50 feet in length. The jetties were usually from 30 feet to 40 feet wide, and 
the depths of water required ranged up to 28 feet. Several of the berths having 
been built by private owners were without shed accommodation. The average 
cost per berth with cargo-sheds, inclusive of value of frontage-land, was 21,300/., 
but the same jetties built to-day at the higher prices would have cost 25,500/. 
per berth. The water-way between jetties varied from 90 feet to 110 feet, 
but in several cases was as little as 80 feet. 

The vessels now coming to Sydney have already touched 18,400-ton mark, 
the largest measuring 555 feet by 69 feet, with a loaded draft of 32 feet. 
Clearly it is necessary to provide for much larger vessels in the future, and it 
would be inadvisable to look forward to anything less than a possible 1,000 feet 
in length, with a loaded draft of 40 feet, though these dimensions may not be 
reached for many years to come. 

The jetties necessary to berth the oversea vessels at present trading to 
Sydney are from 500 feet to 650 feet in length (with provisions for extension), 
by 130 feet to 250 feet in width, and the water-way between them to allow for 
handling, coaling, and transhipping ranges from 220 feet to 360 feet. Double- 
decked cargo-sheds are required to accommodate the large quantities of freio-ht 
rapidly put ashore, and electric cranes, gantries, and other liftino- oear are 
being provided. The cost of these, adding the value of frontage-land°, ranges 
from 67,0007. to 77,0007. per berth, irrespective of dredging, which, particu- 
larly in Sydney, is a small item, but in several other ports will be excessively 
heavy. The requirements for inter-state shipping are scarcely less. Some of

the vessels now engaged in this traffic measure as much as 9,000 and 10,000 tons, 
and no doubt larger ships will be built. 

It seems evident, even after making allowance for the superior earning- 
capacity of these modern berths, that increased harbour rates will have to be 
charged to render such investment sound and self-supporting. This is a ques- 
tion that requires special investigation. Judged from a purely economical point 
of view, there is room for considerable doubt as to whether the advent of the 
large vessel has operated towards lowering the cost of sea-borne freight, includ- 
ing, of course, incidental charges, such as wharfage and tonnage dues, &amp;c. The 
question is greatly complicated by the upward tendency of wages and materials, 
which not only increases the cost of ship construction, but also puts up the cost 
of working expenses and maintenance, which are naturally passed on by the 
shipowner. 

There are, however, other very important considerations which must be 
taken into account. Pressing as the economic question is, there are distinct 
advantages in the employment of big ships. Higher speed can be obtained, 
which, at this distance from Europe, is desirable for mails, passengers, and 
cargo. The time-element is certainly of urgent importance to Australia. 
Greater safety, seaworthiness, steadiness, and comfort are also secured. 

The class of wharf-construction that will come into use in the future, 
though important, is very uncertain at the present time. Timber has been used 
almost entirely in Australia. Reinforced concrete has been dealt with very 
charily, but it is safe to say that, if the local timbers had not proved so satis- 
factory from every point of view, reinforced concrete would have been largely 
used during the last fifteen years. 

Where space is available, longshore wharves, served by low-level road and 
belt railway, offer the greatest facilities for handling cargo. But as this is not 
always possible, jetties will continue to be used to a large extent. To provide 
shed accommodation and low-level road access to facilitate the removal of 
goods, without traffic congestion, necessitates very great width of jetty. In 
Sydney two plans are being tried to meet such cases. In one instance the jetty 
is 210 feet wide, with a sunken road down the middle which brings the cart-body 
to the level of the shed-floor. 

In another case, where the available water-frontage length is restricted, a 
type of jetty is being built with a high and a low side, so that when a cart 
is on the low side the body is at the floor-level of the higher side of the jetty. 
The high side, which extends over about three-quarters of the width of the jetty, 
will be used for inward cargo, which requires as much space as possible for 
sorting and stacking. The low side will be used for traffic and outward cargo, 
which goes aboard the ship as it arrives, and seldom accumulates on the wharf 
to the extent of more than four or five hundred tons at a time. These jetties 
will have an upper deck approached by a bridge from a high-level roadway. 
The upper deck will be constructed with high and low levels, similar to the 
lower deck, but disposed on the opposite sides. Thus, each side of the jetty 
will have a separate loading and unloading deck. On this account it will be 
possible to carry on the two operations together without confusion of outward 
and inward cargo, and the cost of construction will be relatively low. 

The position of the other Australian ports was reviewed in the sanie way, 
for the purpose of considering how far the Port Authorities are justified in 
accepting the challenge of the shipowner. 



3. The Distribution of Phosphorus in Steel. 
By Walteb Eosenhain, B.A., D.Sc, F.R.S. 

The injurious influence of phosphorus on the mechanical properties of steel 
is very fully recognised, so much so that for a large class of important steel 
articles, such as tyres, axles, springs, &amp;c., it is usual to specify that the 
phosphorus content shall not exceed 0-035 per cent. If phosphorus were 
uniformly distributed throughout steel it would be difficult to believe that less 
than four parts in ten thousand could exert a seriously injurious influence. 
Observation of all ordinary commercial steels, however, serves to show at once 
that phosphorus is not uniformly distributed. This matter has been studied, 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G. 511 

chiefly by J. E. Stead, by the method of heat-tinting which differentiates 
between those portions of a polished steel surface rich in phosphorus and those 
free from it by the difference in the rate of oxidation. The banded distribution 
of the phosphorus thus reproduces itself as bands of different depths of tinting 
on the surface after exposure to heat. More recently the author and J. L. 
Haughton at the National Physical Laboratory have worked out a method of 
tracing the phosphorus distribution in steel by means of a new reagent. This 
is a solution of ferric chloride rendered acid by hydrochloric acid and containing 
in solution small quantities of the chlorides of copper and tin. When a steel 
surface is exposed to this reagent electro-chemical replacement occurs, a small 
quantity of iron passes into solution, and a corresponding amount of copper is 
deposited as a thin film on the surface of the steel. In an ideally pure steel 
this deposit would be uniform over the entire area of the ferrite constituent, 
but in a phosphoric steel the copper film is deposited first on those ferrite 
regions which are most nearly pure, those regions richest in phosphorus being 
left unaffected for a long time. Seen under the microscope, the surface thus 
' etched ' by the selective deposition of copper presents a well-defined appear- 
ance wliich at one point reaches a development corresponding accurately to the 
pattern produced by the older method of heat-tinting ; at an earlier stage, 
however, features are shown which escape detection by the older methods. A 
study of these features leads the author to trace back the origin of the banded 
structure of phosphoric steel to processes which are known to occur in the first 
solidification of a ' solid solution ' alloy, so that the coarser or finer banding 
of the finished steel depends upon the scale of crystallisation which took place 
in the original ingot, in spite of the fact that the crystalline structure may have 
been entirely changed repeatedly as the result of thermal or mechanical treat- 
ment. This great persistence of the ' geographical ' distribution of phosphorus 
is to be ascribed to the low velocity of diffusion of iron phosphide when present 
in solid solution in iron. The paper was illustrated by numerous photogi'aphs 
and diagrams. 

4. Notes on some Tests of Petrol Motor Fire-Engines, and the 
Frictional and other Resistances to the Flow of Water through 
Canvas Fire-Hosc. By Professor T. Hudson Beaee, M.Insf.C.E. 

The experiments described in this paper were carried out on two fire-engines. 
The first engine, supplied by Messrs. Merryweather, was driven by a four-cylinder 
'Aster' petrol engine, the cylinders being 5| inches diameter, with a 6^-inches 
stroke, and the speed 1,000 revolutions per minute. The pnmp was of the ' Hat- 
field ' reciprocating type, and had three single-acting plungers of 7-inches bore 
and 5-inches stroke ; the barrels were arranged radially round a common crank-pin 
at an angle of 120° to one another. The pump was driven by a chain, 5^ inches 
wide, and was geared down 4-47 to 1 ; with this gearing 1,000 revolutions of the 
motor would correspond to 224 revolutions of the pump. 

The second engine, supplied by the Halley's Industrial Motor Company, was 
driven by a six-cylinder petrol engine, the cylinders being 5 inches in diameter 
with a 5;|-inches stroke, stated to be capable of developing 60 h.p. at 1,000 revolu- 
tions per minute. The pump, made by Messrs. Mather &amp; Piatt, was of the 
centrifugal type, and was driven direct from the engine by enclosed gearing run- 
ning in oil ; the pump was geared up about 3 to 2 — that is to say, when the engine 
was making 1,000 revolutions the pump would be making about 1,500 revolutions 
per minute. The engine carried a reciprocating exhauster air-pump, driven by a 
chain drive off the pump shaft, this mechanism being necessary in order that the 
centrifugal pump might be charged when drawing its water supply from a dam, 
or any other source in which the water was not under pressure.

The main experiments were to determine the quantity of water pumped per 
minute, and the pressure at the pmnp delivery side and at tlie nozzle. The 
quantity of water pumped was measured either by passing it through a Venturi 
meter on its way to the nozzle or by discharging the water from the nozzle into 
a big swimming-bath which had been carefully calibrated beforehand. The 
Venturi meter was tested for the accuracy of its records both before and after 
the experiments were carried out. 

In order to determine frictional and other resistances to the flow of water 
through the canvas fire-hose, different lengths of hose w-ere tested, all the other 
conditions being kept practically constant, and it was thus possible to eliminate 
the resistances at the point of entry into the hose, and in the meter when the 
water was delivered tlirough a meter, and at the entry to the nozzle. Experi- 
ments were made with ordinary canvas hose and with rubber-lined canvas hose. 
T.he hose experimented with was 2f inches in internal diameter, and various 
diameters of nozzles were employed in the tests. The lengths of hose tested were 
100 feet, 500 feet, and 1,000 feet, and some experiments were made with double 
lines of hose, each delivering to a nozzle of the same diameter. 

The results obtained as to quantities of \vater pimiped, pressiu'es at pump and 
at nozzle, and speed of engine are given in the form of tables, and a final table 
gives the coefficients of frictional and other resistances to the flow of water 
through canvas fire-hose.

'2. Teinperaiiire Cijcles in Ileal-Enyines. 
By Professor E. G. Coker and W. A. Scoble. 

Experimental investigations of the cyclical variations of heat-engines and 
heat-pumps have received much attention, and numerous methods and instru- 
ments have been devised to give records of their cyclical changes, such as those 
of pressure and volume of the worliing fluid, changes of angular velocity of 
the crank-shaft, and the like. Temperature changes in tlie working fluid "may 
usually be inferred very accurately from the pressures recorded on an indicator 
diagram, since there is usually a definite relation between pressure and tem- 
perature of a vapour, as, for example, in heat-engines using steam direct from 
a boiler without the intervention of a superheater. In other heat-engines, surli 
as those using superheated fluids, and also those of the internal-combustion 
type, the temperature is more difficult to determine, and it becomes important 
to measure it directly. Platinum resistance thermometers and thermo-electric 
couples have been frequently employed Un- measuring cyclical changes of 
temperature in heat-engines, and a complete record from point to point of a 
cycle may be obtained if the engine is working with absolute uniformity. As 
it is usually impossible to prevent some amount of variation in the working 
of the engine while the measurements are in progress, the resulting curve is a 
composite one, since each measurement corresponds to a different cycle. 

The possibility of obtaining an instantaneous automatic record with an 
Einthoven type of galvanometer was considered in our early experiments on the 
cyclical variations of temperatiu'e of the working fluid of a gas-engine, and in 
the walls of the cylinder, but the difficulties then appeared to be so great that 
a potentiometer balance method was used instead. Recently, by the kindness 
of the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company, we have been able to make 
experiments with their latest form of short-period Einthoven galvanometer, 
and this has enabled us to obtain instantaneous records of the temperature-cycles 
of the working fluid of steam- and gas-engines, and also the variations of 
temperature in the walls. Some of these photographic records are shown, and 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G. 513 

tJieir detailed characteristics are considered in the paper. Tliey confirm the 
general accuracy of our former measurements on cyclical variations of tempera- 
ture in a gas-engine cylinder, and also show some new features due to variations 
from stroke to stroke caused by misfires and the like. 



3. The Lost Pressure i)i Gaseous Explosions. By Professor W. M. 

Thornton, D.Sc, D.Etig. 

When the maximum pressure of an explosion is calculated from the heat of 
combustion of the elements of the gaseous mixture values are obtained which 
are in all eases about twice those found by experiment. The mean of a large 
number of ' efficiencies of explosion ' for different combustible gases approaches 
one-half. To account for this four chief suggestions liave been made : (1) that 
there is dissociation of the products of combustion ; (2) that the specific heats are 
much higher at explosion temperatures ; (3) that the products are rapidly cooled 
by radiation to the walls of the vessel ; (4-) that the combustion is not complete 
at the time of leaching the maximum pressure. None of these is in itself suffi- 
cient to account for all the loss of pressure. The suggestion is now made that 
it may be caused by the forces of cohesion which come suddenly into play at 
the moment of formation of a molecule, check the translational energy to which 
alone pressure and temperature are due, and raise for the moment the rotational 
energy of the combining bodies. \t i.s shown that the ratio of the translational 
energy of two colliding and cohering bodies before and after collision is one-half, 
and this ratio is to be exi^ected for the whole mixture. 

The suggestion receives support from the form of the curve connecting 
efficiency of explosion and changed percentage of gas iti the mixture. This 
efficiency can be shown to have the form fi = l — BN, where B is a constant and 
N is the number of combustible units in unit volume. A combustible unit is 
defined as that group of one molecule of combustible gas and of oxygen atoms 
just sufficient for its complete combustion. At tiie upper limit N is zero, and 
tlie efficiency curve is triangular on a base coinciding with the limits of 
inHammability. Its mean height is therefore one-half of the maximum, and this 
agrees very fairly well with the observed values given by Clerk in the case of 
coal-gas.

Mininy.' By Professor W. M. Thoknto.v, D.Sc, D.Emj. 

The paper was a sunnnary of recent researches on the limits of electrical 
ignition of inflammable mine-gases and coal-dust. The lower limit of inflani- 
mability is 5'6 per cent, of methane in air by volume; a temperatuie of 200° C. 
lowers this to 5-1 per cent. The most inflammable mixtures are at 8 per cent, 
for contiinious-current break-sparks, 10-2 per cent, for alternating-current 
breaks. Excess of nitrogen appears to markedly increase the necessary igniting 
current. With non-inductive circuits 1 ampere at 100 continuous volts is a 
typical value ; the corresponding values with alternating current are 7 amperes 
at 40 periods a second, 16 at 60, 20 at 8(3, and 29 at 100. By varying the 
inductance the energy of an igniting break-spark is found to be constant at 
about 01 joule. Electric signalling bells have inductance up to 0'5 he)n-y 
and ignite gases at the trembler spark or signalling point. All electric lamps 
and fuses, however small, must be enclosed. Oscillations on a cable sheath 
caused by short circuits on the conductor will not ignite gas, but maintained 
leakage arcs from armouring are only slightly more active than break-sparks. 
Static discharges from 6-inch high-siseed belting could not be made to ignite 
gas, nor the blue brush discharge from high-jiressure conductors. Movements 
of clouds of dust have been sho'wn to give electrification and to cause sparks, 
but the energy must be much greater than can be obtained experimentally in 
order that this should become dangerous. Wireless telegraphy operations on 
the surface do not induce sparking potentials underground. Capacity sparks 
in general from cables left insulated after being charged are very active, 0'002

to O'OOS joule causing ignition. The influence of gas in forwaiding coal-dust 
explosions begins to be felt when 5 per cent, of gas is present. At 2 per 
cent, full ignitions are obtained at every trial. Coal-dust alone can be ignited 
by both continuous-current or alternating-current break-flashes, the former 
requiring 3-5 to 6 amperes at 480 volts in non-inductive circuits, the latter 
14 amperes at 40 periods and on a power factor of 0-8. Continuous-current 
faults on the negative cable develop rapidly in the presence of moisture and 
the cable is disintegrated. Alternating-current faults are self-healing, and a 
mechanical fault does not increase electrically on an alternating-current cable. 

Armouring is necessary under modern power conditions; lighting and sig- 
nalling circuits must be equally well protected to prevent open sparking. The 
limits of safety are electrically low, but the risks of ignition are even now no 
greater than those attending the use of flame safety lamps, and they can be 
entirely prevented.

G. 'ilie Capacilij of Raclio-Telcgraphic Aerials.^ 
By Professor G. W. 0. Howe, D.Sc. 

The capacity considered in this paper is the actual static capacity, and not tlie 
ccjuivalent capacity of the antenna considered as part of an oscillatory circuit. 
The accurate calculation of the capacity of a multiple-wire horizontal aerial 
witli its leading-down wire.s would be a difficult mathematical problem, quite 
unwarrante 1 by the practical requirements of radio-telegraphy. 

When raised to a potential above or below that of the earth, the charge is 
distributed over the antenna in a way which is not easy to calculate, but which 
must be such that all parts of the antenna are at the same potential. If the 
antenna were made up of a great nimiber of short pieces, placed end to end, 
but insulated from each other, it would be possible to distribute the charge 
uniformly, but the ])otential would then vary from point to point in a way which 
is easily calculated. If now we assume that all the separate pieces of wire are 
connected, electricity will flow from points of high to points of low potential 
until the potential is everywhere the same. The assumption made in developing 
the various formuhe is that this final uniform iiotential is equal to tlie average 
value of the potential wlien the charge was uniformly distributed. This is only 
approximately correct, but the accuracy is more than .sufticient for all practical 
purposes. This method has been applied to antenna- of all the types usually 
employed, and formuhe have been established for eacli type. A large number of 
numerical examples have been worked out, and the results are given in tables and 
curves, so that the capacity of any antenna can be read off directly from its 
dimensions. The corrections due to the leading down wires and to the proximity 
of the earth are fully considered, and examples given showing the application of 
the formulae to antenua3 of any type. 

Formula; for the calculation of the capacity of ant-ennaj have recently been 
published by Pedersen ('Jahrbuch der Drahtlosen Telegraphie,' vii. 4, p. 434) 
and Louis Cohen {ElectrirAan, February 14 and 21, 1913). When applied 
to the experimental results quoted by Cohen, the formulae developed in this 
paper give closer agreement than do the formulae given by Cohen, although some 
of his results can hardlv be reconciled with the given data.

President of the Section. — Sir Everard im Tiiurn, C.B., K.C.M.G. 



The President delivered the following Address at Sydney, on Friday, 
August 21 : — ■ 

A Study of Primitive Character. 

Civilisation and ' savagery ' — for unfortunately it seems now too late to substi- 
tute any term of less misleading suggestion for that word ' savagery ' — are the 
labels which we civilised folk apply respectively to two forms of human culture 
apparently so unlike that it is liard to conceive that they had a common origin 
— our own culture and that other, the most primitive form of human culture, 
from which, at some unknown and distant period, our own diverged. But, 
assuming one common origin for the whole human race, we anthropologists can 
but assume that at an early stage in the history of that race some new idea was 
implanted in a part of these folk, that is in the ancestors of civilised folk, which 
caused these thenceforth to advance continuously, doubtless by many again subse- 
quently diverging and often intercrossing roads, some doubtless more rapidly 
than others, but all mainly towards that which is called civilisation, while those 
others, those whom we call ' savages,' were left behind at that first parting of 
the ways, to stumble blindly, advancing indeed after a fashion of their own, but 
comparatively slowly and in a quite different direction. 

It is easyenough for civilised folk, wJien after age-long separation they again 
come acros.s the ' savages,' to discern the existence of wide differences between 
the two, in physical and mental characteristics, and in arts and crafts; it is not 
so easy, it may even be that it is impossible, to detect the exact nature of these 
differences, esiaecially in the matter of mental characters. 

As a rule the occupant of this presidential chair is one who, whether he 
has seen much of ' savages ' at close quarters or not, has had much ampler 
opportunity than lias fallen to my lot of comparative study of that great mass of 
anthropological observations which, gathered from almost every part of the 
world, has'now been recorded at headquarters. T, on the other hand, happen to 
have spent the better part of my active life in two different parts of the world, 
remote from books and men of science, but in both of which folk of civilised and 
of savage culture have been more or less intermixed, but as yet very imperfectly 
combined, and in both of wliich I have been brought into rather unusually close 
and sympathetic contact with folk who, whatever veneer of civilisation may have 
been put upon them, are in the thoughts which lie at the back of their minds and 
in character still almost as when their ancestors were at the stage of savage 
culture. 

While trying to adjust the mutual relations of wild folk and of folk of 
civilised stock, I have seen from close at hand the clash which is inevitable when 
the two meet — a clash which is naturally all the greater when the meeting is 
sudden. Moreover, having started with a strong taste for natural history, and 
especially for the natural history of man. and having had much guidance from 
many anthropological friends and from books, I have perhaps been especially 
fortunate in opportunity for studying the more natural human animal at close 
quarter.s and in his natural surroundings. I have tried, from as abstract and 

L L 2 



516 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H. 

unprejudiced a point of view as possible, to understand the character, the 
mental and moral attitude, of the natural ' savage ' as he must have been when 
civilised folk first found him and, at first without much effort to understand 
him, tried abruptly to impose an extremely different and alien form of culture 
on this almost new kind of man. 

I venture to claim, though with dfffidence, that I may have begun to discern 
more clearly, even though only a little more clearly than usual, what the primi- 
tive man, the natural ' savage ' — or, as he might more accurately be described, 
the wild man — was like; and it seemed possible that an attempt to bring 
together a picture — it can hardly be more than a sketch — of the mentality and 
character of some one group of people who had never passed out of the stage of 
' savagery ' might be interesting and practically useful, especially if it proves 
possible to disentangle the more primitive ideas of such people from those which 
they subsequently absorbed by contact, at first with other wild, but less wild, 
folk, and later with civilised folk; and that a further study of the retention 
by these folk of some of their earlier habits of thought during later stages in 
their mental development might suggest a probable explanation of certain of 
their manners and customs for which it is otherwise hard to account. 

The attainment of some such understanding is, or should be, one of the chief 
objectives of the practical anthropologist, not merely for academic purposes, but 
also for the practical guidance of those who in so many parts of our Empire are 
brought into daily contact with so-called ' savages.' 

Perhaps hardly anywhere else in the world would it be possible to find better 
opportunity and more suitable conditions for such a study as I now propose than 
in the tropical islands of the South Seas. The ancestors of these islanders, while 
still in purely ' savage ' condition, must have drifted away from the rest of the 
human race, and entered into the litter seclusion of that largest of oceans, the 
Pacific, covering as it does more than a third of the surface of the globe, long 
before the first man of civilised race, Balboa, in 1513, from the Peak in Darien, 
set eyes on the edge of what he called ' the Great South Sea,' before Magellan, in 
1520, forced his way into and across that same sea, which he called the Pacific, 
and certainly long before civilised men settled on any part of the shore of that 
ocean, i.e., in 1788, at the foundation of Australia. For when first studied 
at close quarters by civilised folk from Europe, which was not till after the 
last-named event, these South Sea 'savages' had been in seclusion during a 
period sufficiently long — and certainly no short period would have sufficed for 
such an effect — not only for them all to have assumed characters, cultural and 
even physical, sufficient to distinguish them from all other folk outside the 
Pacific, but also for them to have split up into many separate parties, probably 
sometimes of but few individuals, many of which had drifted to some isolated 
island or island-group, and had there in the course of time taken on further well- 
marked secondary differences. 

It will probably now never be discovered when, how often, and from what 
different places the ancestors of these folk • reached the Pacific, It is quite 
possible that they entered again and again, and were carried by winds and 
currents, some from west to east and some in the reverse direction, many perish- 
ing in that waste of waters, but some reaching land and finding shelter on some 
of that great cloud of small islands which lie scattered on both sides of the 
equator and nearly across that otherwise landless ocean. 

Of the folk who in those old times thus drifted about and across the Pacific, 
the most important, for the part which they played in the story which I am 
endeavouring to tell, were the two hordes of ' savages ' now known respectively 
as Melanesians and Polynesians. Without entering deeply into the difficult sub- 
ject of the earlier migrations of these two hordes, it will suffice here to note 
that, towards the end of the eighteenth century, when European folk at last 
began to frequent the South Sea Islands, and when consequently something 
definite began to be known in Europe about the islanders, certain Melanesians, 
who had probably long previously drifted down from north-westward, were 
found to be, and probably had long been, in occupation of the exceptionally 
remote and isolated Fiji Islands; also that, long after this Melanesian occupa- 
tion of these islands, and only shortly before Europeans began to frequent them, 
several bodies of Polynesians, who had long been in occupation of the Friendly 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 517 

or Toiigaii Islands, lying away to the east of Fiji, had already foiLud oi' were 
I'orciiig their way into the Fijian Islands. 

The meeting in Fiji of these two folk, both still in a state of ' savagery,' but 
the Polynesians much further advanced in culture than the Melanesians, at a 
time before European inHuence had begun to strengthen in those islands, affords 
an exceptionally good opportunity for the study of successive stages in the 




„- Fiji. 

of the kind to observe and to leave proper records of their observations. 

The earlier, Melanesian, occupants of Fiji had to some extent given way, but 
by no means readily and completely, to the Polynesian invaders. The former, not 
only in the mountain fastnesses difficult of access, but also in such of the islets 
as "the local wind and weather conditions made difficult of access, retained 
their own distinct and simpler culture, their own thoughts, habits, and arts, long 
after the Polynesians had seized tlie more important places accessible to the sea., 
and had imposed much of their own more elaborate (but still 'savage') culture 
on such of the Melanesians' communities as they had there subjugated and 
absorbed. 

The social organisation throughout Fiji remained communistic; but in the 
purely Melanesian communities the system was purely democratic {i.e., without 
chiefs), while in the newer mixed Polynesian-Melanesian comjuunitics — as was 
natural when there had been intermingling of two unequally cultured races^ 
tliere had been developed a sort of oligarchic system, in which the Melanesian 
commoners worked contentedly, or at least witli characteristic resignation, for 
their new Polynesian chiefs. 

Alike in all these communities custom enforced by club-law prevailed ; but in 
the one case the administrative function rested with the community as a whole, 
while in the other it was usurped by t&lt;he chiefs. 

Though we are here to consider mainly the ideas, the mentality, of these 
jieople, it will be useful to say a few preliminary words as to their arts and 
crafts. The Melanesians during their long undisturbed occupation of the islands 
had undoubtedly made great progress, on lines peculiar to them, especially 
in boat building, in which they excelled all other South Sea islanders, in the 
making of clubs and other weapons, and in otherwise using the timber, which 
grew more abundantly, and of better quality, in their Lslands than elsewhere. 
Meanw-hile the Polynesians, in their earlier homes and long before they reached 
Fiji, had developed, in very high degree, corresponding but different and much 
more elaborate arts (and ideas) of their own. But, as we know from Captain 
('ook, the Polynesians, despite their own higher culture, from their Tongan 
homes, greatly admired and appreciated the special craftsmanship of the Fijians, 
and it was indeed this admiration which attracted the former from Tonga to Fiji ; 
and when the Polynesians had gained footing in the Fijis they — Cjuite in accord- 
ance with human nature — were inclined, for a time at least, to foster the foreign 
Fijian arts — if not Fijian ideas — rather than replace these by their own arts; and 
before the struggle, both physical and cultural, between the two sets of ' savages' 
had gone far it was interrupted, and more or less definitely arrested, by the 
arrival and gradual settlement of the still more powerful, because civilised, white 
folk from the Western world. 

In turning to the earlier (Melanesian) occupants of Fiji, and especially to 
the less advanced of these, to find the traces of which we are in search of the 
more primitive habit of thought, it must not be forgotten that even at the sta,ge 
at which we begin to know about them they had made considerable advance, in 
their ideas as well as in their arts and crafts. They still used their most 
primitive form of club, but also made others of much more elaborated form; so, 
though the ideas which lay at the basis of their habit of thought were of very 
primitive kind, they had acquired others of more complex character. 

Before going further may I say — and I sincerely hope that the suggestion will 
not be misunderstood — ^that in the difficult task of forming a clear conception of 
the fundamental stock of thought which must have guided the conduct of the more 
primitive folk we must constantly bear in mind the parallelism (I do not mean 
necessary identity of origin) between the thoughts of the earliest human folk and 



518 TRANSAOTIONS OF SECTION H. 

the coirespoudiug instincts (as these are called) noticenLle in the case of some of 
the higher animals ? I am particularly anxious not to be misunderstood ; the 
suggestion is not that even the most primitive human folk were mentally merely 
on a par even with the higher animals, but that many, perhaps most, of the 
ways of thought that guided the primitive man in his bearing towards the world 
outside himself may be more easily understood if it is once realised, and after- 
Avards remembered, that the two mental habits, however different in origin and 
in degree of development, were remarkably analogous in kind. 

A similar analogy, in respect not of thoughts but of arts, may well illustrate 
this correspondence between the elementary ideas of men and animals. The 
higher apes occasionally arm themselves by tearing a young tree up by the 
roots .and using the 'club ' thus provided as a weapon of offence and defence 
against their enemies. Some of the primitive South Sea islanders did — nay, do — 
exactly the same, or at any rate did so till very lately. The club — the so-called 
maluniu — which the Fijian, then and up to the much later time when he ceased to 
use a club at all, greatly preferred to use for all serious fighting purposes was pro- 
vided in exactly the same way, i.e., by dragging a young tree from the ground, and 
smoothing off the more rugged roots to form what the American might call the 
business end of the club. But though the Fijian, throughout the period during 
wliich he retained his own ways, used and even preferred this earliest form of 
club, he meanwhile employed his leisure (which was abundant), his fancy, and his 
ingenuity, in ornamenting this weapon, and also in gradually adapting it to more 
and more special purposes, some of the later of whicli were not even warlike but 
were ceremonial purposes, till in course of time each isolated island or group of 
islands evolved clubs special to it in form, purpose, and ornament, and the very 
numerous and puzzlingly varied series of elaborate and beautiful clubs and club- 
shaped implements resulted. It seems to be in power of improvement and 
elaboration that lies the difference between men-folk and animal-folk. 

Something similar may be assumed to have brought- about the evolution of 
the ideas of these islanders. Starting with a stock of tlioughts similar in kind 
to the instincts of the more advanced animals, the human-folk — by virtue of 
some mysterious potentiality — gradually adapted these to meet the special 
circumstances of their own surroundings, and in so doing ornamenting these 
primitive thoughts further in accordance with fancy. 

In the Fiji Islands this process of cultural development was probably slow 
during the long period while the Melanesians, with perhaps the occasional 
stimulus afforded by the drifting in of a little human flotsam and jetsam from 
other still more primitive folk, were in sole occupation ; yet it must have been 
during this period and by these folk that the distinctively Fijian form of cultui'e 
was evolved. But the process must have been greatly accelerated, and at the 
same time more or less changed in direction, by the incoming of the distinct and 
higher Polynesian culture, at a time certainly before, but perhaps not very long 
before, the encroachment of Europeans. 

In order to realise as vividly as possible what were the earlier, most elemen- 
tary, thoughts on which the whole detail of his subsequent ' savage ' mentality 
was gradually imposed, it is essential for the time being to discard practically 
all the ideas which, since the road to civilisation parted from that on which 
savagery was left to linger, have built up the mentality of civilised folk ; it is 
essential to try to see as the most primitive Fijian saw and to conceive what these 
islanders thought as to themselves and as to the world in which they found 
themselves. 

It seems safe to assume that the primitive man, absolutely self-centred, had 
hardly begun to puzzle out any explanation even of his own nature, still less of 
the real nature of all the other beings of which he must have been vaguely 
conscious in the world outside himself. To put it bluntly, he took things very 
much as they came, and had hardly begun to ask questions. 

He was — he could not but be, as the lower animals are — in some vague way 
conscious of himself, and from that one entirely self-centred position he could 
not but perceive from time to time that other beings, more or less like himself, 
were about him, and came more or less in contact with him. 

The place in which he was conscious of being a.)i]K'arcd to him limitless. 
He did not realise that he could move about only in the islet which was his 



PRERIBENTTAL AnDRKR?!. ")! 

iiome, or perhapa even only in a part of a soniewliat larger, but according to our 
ideas still small, island ; if other islets were in sight from that on which he 
lived, these also would be part of his world, especially if — though such incidents 
must have been rare — he had crossed to, or been visited by strangers from, those 
islands — islands which lay between his own home and that which he spoke of as 
ivai-langi-lala (water-sky-emptiness) and we speak of as the horizon. To him 
the world was not limited by any line, even the furthest which his sight dis- 
closed to him. Rarely, but still sometimes, strangers had come from beyond 
that line. Perhaps too he had some time heard that his ancestors had come 
from the somewhere which seemed beyond. Again his ancestors of whom he had 
heard, and even some of the contemporaries whom he had seen, though no longer 
W'ith him except occasionally during his dreams in bodily form, were somewhere, 
somewhere beyond that line of sight. Even he himself (in what were his 
dreams, as we say, but to liim were part of his real life) habitually went beyond 
the line, and, as far as his experience had gone, returned each time to the 
island home. 

Moreover, he did not doubt that this limitless region in which it vaguely 
.■seemed to him that he, and innumerable other beings, moved, extended not 
merely along what we speak of as the surface of the globe, but also, and 
equally without any intervening obstacle, up into the infinite space above and 
beyond the sky. In short, to this primitive man the world, though the part 
of it to which he had actual access was so small, was limitless. 

The thoughts of the dweller in this vague world, as to himself and as to the 
other beings of which from time to time he became conscious, must have been 
correspondingly indefinite. 

He was, to a degree almost if not quite beyond our power of conception, 
a spiritualist rather than a materialist; and it is essential to get some idea of 
the extent and manner of his recognition of spiritual beings — and his correspond- 
ing non-recognition of things material. 

In passing I here disclaim, for myself at least, the use of the misleading 
word ' belief ' in speaking of the ideas of really primitive man — as, for instance, 
in the phrase the ' belief in immortality.' Possibly primitive men of somewhat 
more advanced thought, though not yet bej'ond the stage of ' savagery,' may 
have 'believed ' in spirits, in immortality, and so on; but it seems to me that 
at the earlier stage there can hardly have been more than recognition (admittedly 
very strong recognition) of spiritual beings, and non-recognition of any beginning 
or ending of these spirits. 

To return from tliis digression, Sir E. B. Tylor long since gave currency to 
the very useful word 'animism ' as meaning ' the belief in spiritual beings,' and 
this has been taken to mean that animism was the initial stage, or at any rate 
tlie earliest discoverable stage, of all religion. The primitive Fijian was cer- 
tainly a thorough-going animist, if his extraordinarily strong but vague recog- 
nition of s]jiritual beings .suffices to make him that; but T do not think that tlie 
ideas of that kind of the primitive 'savage ' — or, say, of the most primitive Fijian 
— before his ideas had been worked up into somewhat higher thought, during the 
long period while he was secluded in his remote islands and before the advent 
of the Polynesians, had developed far enough to constitute anything whicli 
could be called ' religion,' though doubtless they were the sort of stuff which, 
had these folk been left to themselves, might, probably did, form the basis 
of the ' religion ' towards which they were tending. 

Practically all human beings — savage and civilised alike — and, though in 
lower degree, even animal-folk, have in some degree recognised the existence 
of some sort of spiritual beings. The point tlien seems to be to discover what 
was the nature of the spiritual beings which the primitive Fijian recognised 
hut without understanding. 

Anthropologists have recently defined, or at least described, several kinds of 
spiritual beings as recognised (even here I will not use the word ' believed ") 
by more or less primitive folk. There is, first, the soul, or the separable 
personality of the living man or other being; secondly, the ghost, or the same 
thing after death; thirdly, the spirit, which is said to be a soul-like being which 
has never been associated with a human or animal body; and, fourthly, there 
is, it appears, to be taken into consideration yet another kind of spiritual being 



520 TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION H. 

(nr something of that nature) which is the life of personality, not amountinc; to 
a separable or apparitional soul, which, it has been supposed, some primitive 
folk have attributed to what we call ' inanimate things.' 

It seems, though I say this with all due deference, that this identification 
and naming of various kinds of spiritual beings, though it may hold good of 
animism at a higher stage, does not fit the case of the more primitive animist 
(say, that of the Melanesian in the very backward state in which, as far as we 
know, he first reached Fiji), for presumably he had not as yet recognised nor 
differentiated between the various kinds just enumerated. He recognised some- 
tliing which may be called the 'soul,' which was the separable personality of the 
living man or other being. But he did not recognise— perhaps it would be 
better to say that he had not yet attained to recognition of — the ghost, or the 
same thing after death ; for he had not even recognised any real break, involving 
change, at death. Nor, as I think, did he recognise a spirit, i.e., a soul-like 
being which had never been associated with a human or animal body; for he 
had no idea of any spiritual being which did not, or could not, on occasion 
associate itself with a human, animal, or other material body, nor seemingly 
had he reached the stage, labelled animatism, in which he would have attributed 
life and personality to things (which I take to mean things which are to us 
inanimate). 

All that the most primitive man would recognise would be that he himself — ■ 
the essential part of him — was a being (for convenience and for want of a better 
name it may be called 'soul') temporarily separable at any time from the 
material body in which it happened to be, and untrammelled — except to some 
extent by the clog of the body — by any such conditions as time and space; he 
had found no reason to think that in these respects the many other beings of 
which from time to time he became aware (whether these were what we should 
class as men, other animals, or the things which we speak of as inanimate, sucli 
as stocks and stones, or bodiless natural phenomena, such as winds) differed 
from himself only in the comparatively unimportant matter of bodily form ; 
moreover, it seemed to him that, as he himself could to some extent do all 
these, the other beings, and some perhaps even more easilj', were able to pass 
from one body to another. 

He felt tliat these ' souls ' were only temporarily and more or less loosely 
attached to the particular material forms in which they happened to manifest 
themselves at any moment, and that the material form in which the soul (and 
noticeably this held good even of his own soul) happened at any moment to be 
embodied was of little or no real importance to that soul, which could continue 
to exist just as well without as with that body. 

Another point which it is important to note is the egoism of the savage man 
as distinguished from the altruism of the civilised man ; for it was perhaps the 
beginning of the idea of altruism, of duty to one's neighbour, that gave the 
start to civilisation, and it was because the ancestors of the savage had never 
got hold of this fundamental principle of altruism that they were left behind. 

The uncivilised man, complete egoist as he was, thought and acted only for his 
own personal interests. It is true that he was to a certain extent kind (as we 
might call it) to the people of his own small community, and possibly still more 
kind to snch of the community as seemed to him more immediately of his own 
kindred. But this kindness was little more than instinctive — little more than a 
way of attracting further service. It is also true that on the occasions, which 
must have been very rare till a late period in the Melanesian occupation of Fiji, 
when strangers — i.e., persons of whom die had not even dreamed — came, so sur- 
prisingly, into his purview, he was sometimes civil or even hospitable to those 
strangers (it should not be forgotten that to him these were souls embodied by 
separable accident in material forms) ; but this would have been only on occasions 
on which he knew, or susnected, that these visitors were stronger than him.^elf 
and able to injure or benefit him. 

Another point of great significance in the character of this primitive man 
was that he had no conception of ownership of property. To him all that we 
should class as goods and chattels, his land, or even his own body, was his only 
so long as he could retain it. He might if he could and would take any such 
property from another entirely without impropriety; nor would he resist, or even 



PRERTPRNTTAL ADDRESS. 521 

wish to resist, the taking from himself of any such property by any one who 
could and would take it. 

Again, the primitive man must have been far less sensitive to pain, and far 
less subject to fear, than the normal civilised man. I do not mean that the 
primitive Fijian was without the ordinary animal shrinking from physical pain, 
but that he cannot have been nearly as sensitive even to physical pain as is the 
more sophisticated man : nor had he the same mental pain, the same anticipation 
and fear of pain, that the civilised man has. 

Having thus dealt with some of the more important points in the oharacter 
of the primitive Fijian, T propose next to consider how far these suffice to account 
for some of the more ' savage ' conditions under which these islanders when first 
seen were living. 

Cainiibalism claims the first mention, in that, though the practice has been 
recorded from many other parts of the world, it is commonly supposed to have 
been carried further in Fiji than elsewhere. 

Here, however, it is at once necessary to point out that the outbreak of 
cannibalism in Fiji in the first half of the last century was not due to any 
innate and depraved taste on the part of the Fijians, and that the practice to the 
degree and after the fashion of which the story-books tell was not natural to the 
Fijian, whether of Melanesian or Polynesian stock. 

It is probable, even perhaps certain, that all the Fiji islander."; occasionally ate 
human flesh before the coming of white men to the islands; but it was only after 
the arrival of the new-comers that this practice, formerly only occasional and 
hardly more than ceremonial, developed into the abominable orgies of the first 
half of the last century. The first Europeans to set foot — about 1800 — and to re- 
main In the islands for any time were the so-called ' beachcombers.' At first at 
least, these renegades from civilisation, to secure their own precarious position 
and safety, contrived to put themselves under the patronage of some one or other 
of the great native chiefs, who would be Polynesians, and assisted and egged on 
these chiefs in their then main occupation of fighting other great rival chiefs, also 
Polynesians, and raiding the less advanced Melanesians of the surrounding dis- 
tricts. The guns and ammunition which the beachcombers, in some cases at 
least, brought with them or managed to procure, and the superior craft which 
they had imbibed from civilisation, greatly assisted them in this immoral pur- 
pose. Consequently a habit of cruelty, new to the Fijian, was implanted and 
developed, especially in the Polynesian chiefs. It became more and more a 
fashion for the greatest native warriors, thus egged on, to vie with each other in 
the number of their victims and in the reckless cruelty with which these were 
killed. Doubtless at first the victims were opponents killed in fight, sometimes 
great rival chiefs and sometimes mere /loi pollni who had been led out to fight, 
probably not very reluctantly, for their chiefs. Incidentally more and more 
people were killed; and the bodies of the slain were conveniently disposed of in 
the ovens. A taste for this food was thus developed in the chiefs — though this 
seems, for a time at least, to have been confined to the great chiefs, most of those 
of lower status, and all women, refusing to partake, at any rate till a later 
period. Before long, when the number of the killed ran short, the deficiency was 
made up by clubbing more and more even of their own people, till eventually the 
great native warrior took pride in the mere number of those he liad killed and 
eaten. 

It seems probable that even the coming of the missionaries, who first reached 
Fiji thirty or forty years after the earliest beachcombers, and at once began 
almost heroic efforts to stop cannibalism, thereby to some extent temporarily even 
aggravated the evil. For the chiefs, in their characteristic temper of gasconade, 
killed and ate more and more unrestrainedly, in mockery of the missionaries and 
to show what fine fellows they thought themselves to be. 

To return from this digression into a somewhat distasteful subject, cannibalism 
as practised by the Fijians before the coming of white men was very different, 
and, from the Fijian point of view — if I may say so witihout fear of being mis- 
understood — not altogether indefensible. It must be remembered that there was, 
as it were, no killing in our sense of the word involved, merely a setting free 
from the non-essential body of the essential soul, which soul survived just as well 
without the body as with it. 



522 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H. ^ 

Note that tlie soul must linve been cnnsidered .as in some way and for a 
time still associated with its late body if, as is commonly and perhaps rightly 
held, the slayer sometimes ate som&amp; part of the body of the slain in order to 
acquire some of the qualities of the slain. 

Again, there can be little doubt that men were sometimes killed for sacrificial 
purposes, the material bodies of the victims being placed at some spot (perhaps 
the tomb) considered to be frequented by the disembodied spirit of some 
ancestor for whom it was desired to provide a spirit attendant. It may be 
noted that this sacrificial use of the body might be combined with an eating 
of the same body when once it had served its first purpose of attributing the 
spirit which had been in it to the service of the honoured ancestor. 

It has been laid to the charge of the Fijians (as to that of many other folk 
of savage and even of civilised culture) that they habitually killed strangers, 
especially such as had been washed or drifted to the islands by the sea — who, 
in early times at least, must have been almost the only strangers to arrive. 
Tlie charge, like that of cannibalism, has been exaggerated, and the facts— 
as far as there were any — on which this charge was founded have been mis- 
understood. 

Here, again, the attitude of the Fijian in this respect was hardly different 
from that of the lower animals under .'similar circumstances. The Fijian knew of 
no reason to be glad of the arrival of strangers, unless these could, in one way 
or another, be useful to him; and, as has already been explained, he knew 
of no reason why he .should not make the best use possible of the stranger, of his 
body or his spirit, separately or together. 

While, as must have been the case in earlier times, the new-comers were 
dark-skinned men like himself, the Fijian might without the slightest prick of 
conscience separate their bodies from their spirits, and dispose of the body or 
the spirit separately ; or without effecting this separation, he might simply 
enslave the new-comers ; or, again, if he suspected that the new-comers were too 
strong for him, he might yield himself to them as a slave. 

And later, when Europeans began to arrive, sometimes as refugees from 
passing ships and sometimes as survivors from ships wrecked on the surrounding 
reefs, the bearing of the Fijian towards this new kind of stranger would have 
been on the same principles, only that in this case the new-comers, being of far 
less readily understood kind, would be regarded with more suspicion and also 
more respect. I believe that very seldom, if ever, was an inoffensive white man, 
wrecked sailor or other, killed, or treated with anything but kindliness and 
courtesy, even though the wrecked man's property might naturally be appro- 
priated by the natives. It was only when white-skinned strangers became com- 
moner, and frequently more offensive, and when familiarity had bred contempt, 
that they were killed, as nuisances, and, especially during the great outbreak of 
cannibalism, were eaten. 

This point in the bearing of the i.slanders to white men might be further 
illustrated by a circumstance which, to my surprise, I have never found men- 
tioned, i.e., that during the whole period while the missionaries were, with a 
rashness only justified by the circumstances, testifying against the natives in 
Fiji not one of these was killed, till at a much later period, when European 
influence was all but predominant in Fiji, Baker was killed and eaten under very 
sjjecial circumstances. 

If it were possible to ascertain in each case the facts as to the reception by 
' savages ' of the first white men they saw, it would almost certainly be 
found that the reception was apparently kindly, though this kindness "may 
really have been due to fear and not to charity. It was, however, quite probable 
that at any moment the savage might find that his dread of the white man was 
unfounded, and in that case he might kill him {i.e.. separate his soul from his 
bod,y) without hesitation, and after doing this his fear — he probably never had 
any affection for him — of the disembodied spirit of the white man might be as 
great, or even greater, than before. 

Incidentall.y it may here be noted, as a further curious point, that a Fijian 
who thus quite remorselessly set free the soul of a stranger from its body would 
probably not often and not for long in his dreams be revisited by his victim, 
if a native; and perhaps not even if the victim were a white man, unless very 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 523 

remarkable. In ullicr wurd«, tlie victim survives only just su lung as ho is 
remembered. Captain Cook, we know, survived for very long, pcrliaps docs 
so still; few, if any, of such beachcombers as were later killed in Fiji survived 
for any length of time: and the innumerable natives who were drifted or washed 
to one or other of the islands must for the most part have passed from memory 
soon after they were killed. 

It has been suggested that the killing of strangers may have been for tiic 
purpose of preventing the introduction of disease ; and it is certain that, 
perhaps even before the coming of white men, the islanders recognised that the 
advent of strangers was curiously often and most disastrously followed by the 
introduction of new diseases, either real diseases or at least some queer, unex- 
plained influence which has so often made life not worth living for savages 
where white strangers have been. 

The Fijians were hardly more notorious for cannibalism than for theft — and 
almost as undeservedly. There is hardly an account of the visit of a European 
ship in early times to any of the islands which does not mention that the islanders 
who came aboard took whatever they fancied, either quite openly or if furtively 
then without evinciiitg anything like shame when discovered. This habit, which 
the explorers naturally called theft, was but the manifestation of a Sonth Sea 
custom, due to the entire absence of any idea of personal property, which 
in Fiji is called keri-keri. To keri-keri was to take whatever you wanted and 
could take without the previous holder of the property preventing you. In old 
days no Fijian doubted his own absolute right to keri-keri, nor did he feel tlie 
very slightest shame in thus (as we should say) ' depriving another of his 
property' or 'stealing '; and even to this day the Fijian, provided that he is 
not really Europeanised, will keri-keri without shame. In short the idea of 
ownership and individual property never occurred to the natural Fijian. He 
took what he wanted, and was strong enough to take. But, on the other hand, 
he yielded up, practically without reluctance, whatever another stronger or 
cleverer than himself wanted and was able to take from him. 

Of the many other charges of 'savagery ' made against Fijians, I can, in the 
time at my disposal, deal with but one more, that as to their strange and grue- 
some habit of celebrating great occasions by killing their own folk. When a 
Fijian chief died, as we should say, or, as it seemed to the surviving natives, 
when his soul left the body which it had for a time used, his widows, and other 
of his kindred and dependents, unwilling to be left behind, were strangled, often 
indeed helped to strangle themselves, that their bodies might be put into the 
graves, while their souls went gladly with that of the chief whom they had been 
accustomed to follow. 

Again, when a chief built a house, some of his dependents, whom the great 
man told off for the purpose, willingly stepped down into the holes which had 
been dug for the house-posts, and remained there while the earth was filled in 
on to them, and continued thereafter as permanent supporters of tire house. 

Again, there is a tradition, which at least was not incredible to the natives, 
that a great chief one day went a-fishing, and caught many fish. Two 
brothers of humbler rank who happened to have come down to the same water- 
side, also to fish, were less successful. The chief, in a characteristic freak of 
generosity, presented his best fish to the elder of the two brothers, who, strictly 
according to Fijian custom, accepted the gift, but felt bound to make an 
immediate return, but he had nothing to give. Thereupon the younger brother, 
at his own suggestion, was clubbed by the elder, and his body presented to the 
chief in token that his soul would thereafter serve that chief" 

It is even said that when yams and other vegetables were brought in as 
food for the chiefs by the dependents who had grown them for that purpose, 
the food-bearers, if there was a scarcity of fish or other suitable accompaniment 
for the vegetable diet, were themselves clubbed and their bodies eaten. This 
particular atrocity probably happened only after the habit of cannibalism had, 
as already explained, been unnaturally intensified. But the story is note- 
worthy in that the food bearers are not represented as in any way dreading or 
shirking the use to which their bodies were put. 

Ill all the.se and similar cases it is to be noted that the victims (as we are 
naturally inclined to call them) were more or less indifferent, if indeed they 



524 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H. 

were not eagerly consenting parties, to the use (cruel as it seems to us) made 
of their material bodies. Thus the widows were eager to be strangled, and 
often even helped to do the deed, in order that they — all that was essential of 
them, i.e., their souls — should rejoin the deceased. Similarly those others who 
were killed on the occasion of the funeral were quite willing to give their 
bodies, which seemed of comparatively little importance, as ' grass ' to be added 
to the cut fern and other soft material on which the body of the deceased chief 
was couched in the grave ; and quite willingly the men told off for that purpose 
stepped down into the holes in which the house-posts were grounded, that they, 
or rather their bodies, might thereafter hold up the house, while their souls 
enjoyed life much as before but without the encumbrance of the body. Others 
again contentedly grew tciro for the chiefs to eat, and carried it in when ripe, 
thinking it of little importance that their mere bodies might be eaten with the 
iuro. 

In conclusion, having endeavoured to realise for myself, and to show you a 
glimpse, of the enormous, hardly conceivable difference in habit of thought, and 
consequently in character, which separates the savage from the civilised man, 
J will offer a suggestion which seems to me possibly the most important outcome 
of my personal experience, now closed, as an anthropological administrator in 
tropical places where Eastern and Western folk have met, and where the 
inevitable clash between the two has occurred. 

In such places and circumstances the result has too often been that sooner 
or later the weaker folk — those whose ancestors have been age-long 'savages' — 
have died out in the jn-esence of those whose ancestors long ago turned from 
'savagery' to civilisation. This dying out of the weaker folk has happened even 
when the stronger people have done their best to avoid this extirpation. 

The real ultimate cause of ' the decrease of natives ' when in contact with 
ci\ilised folk lies, perhajjs, in the difference in hereditary mentality — in the in- 
capacity of the ' savage ' to take on civilisation quickly enough. However 
sedulously the missionary, the Government official, and others who take a real 
interest in so doing, may teach civilised ])iecepts to the essential savage, tlie 
subject of this sedulous case — however advanced a savage culture he may have 
attained — will, at least for many generations, remain a savage, i.r., for just so 
long as he is under influence of the civilised teacher he may act on the utterly 
strange precepts taught him, but away from that influence he will act on his 
own hereditary instincts. 

The maimer in which the native dies out — even when well looked after — 
varies. He may be k'illed out by some disease, perhajis trifling but new to him, 
with which he does not know how to cope, and with which — if he can avoid so 
doing — he simply will not cope in the ways which the civilised man would teach 
him; or he may be killed out by the well-meant but injudicious enforcement on 
him of some system of unaccustomed labour; or, again, he may die out because 
deprived of his former occupations (c.f/., fighting and the gathering of ju.st so 
much food as sufficed for him) and thus restricted to a merely vegetative exist- 
ence ; or in many other more or less similar forms his extermination may come 
about. 

But all such effective causes are reducible to one, which is that he is not 
allowed to act on his own hereditary instincts, that he cannot at all times 
have, and often would not use, judicious and disinterested guidance from civilised 
folk, and that consequently he, the ' savage,' cannot and too often does not 
care to keep alive when in the presence of civilised folk.

ancient inhabitants of Western Asia on the one hand and certain Polynesians 
on the other— suggesting far-reaching prehistoric migrations, the distribution 
of certain peculiarly distinctive practices, such as mummification and the build- 
ing of megalithic monuments, is made use of to confirm the reality of such 
wanderings of peoples, the author said : — 

' I have already (at the Portsmouth, Dundee, and Birmingham meetings) dealt 
with the problem as it affects the Mediterranean littoral and Western Europe. 
On the present occasion I propose to direct attention mainly to the question of 
the spread of culture from the centres of the ancient civilisations along the 
Southern Asiatic coast and from there out into the Pacific. From the examina- 
tion of the evidence supplied by megalithic monuments and distinctive burial 
customs, studied in the light of the historical information relating to the influence 
exerted by Arabia and India in the Far East, one can argue by analogy as to 
the nature of migrations in the even more remote past to explain the distribution 
of the earliest peoples dwelling on the shores of the Pacific. 

' Practices such as mummification and megalith-building present so many 
l)eculiar and distinctive features that no hypothesis of independent evolution caii 
seriously be entertained in explanation of their geographical distribution. 
They must be regarded as evidence of the diffusion of information, and the 
migrations of bearers of it, from somewhere in the neighbourhood of the Eastern 
Mediterranean step by step out into Polynesia and even perhaps beyond the 
Pacific to the American littoral.' 



2. The Short Ciats of the North-EasI of Scothind. 
By Alexander Low, M.A., M.D. 

The Short Cists of the North-East of Scotland are single interments found 
mostly without any overground structure to indicate their site. The cists are 
built of irregularly shaped flat stones set on edge, and roofed over by one large 
flat covering stone. The internal dimensions vary, but an average cist measures 
three feet long by two feet wide and one foot six inches deep. There is no 
evidence of the cists being oriented in any particular direction. In the cists 
examined burial was by inhumation. There is evidence to show that, while 
burial by inhumation was the earlier practice, inhumation and incineration were 
partly contemporaneous ; and this is borne out by one cist, in which along with a 
burial by inhumation were found calcined human bones. 

Besides the skeletal remains there were associated with the interments clay 
urns, flint scrapers, flint arrowheads, but no trace of metal. The urns were 
all of the ' beaker ' type, except in one instance, where the urn was of the ' food- 
vessel ' type. 

We have made a detailed examination of a series of fifteen somewhat complete, 
short cist skeletons preserved in the Anatomy Department of the University of 
Aberdeen. The skull form is very uniform in its characters. A skull, from a 
short cist recovered at Parkhill, Aberdeenshire, may be taken as representative 
of the type. The skull is that of a male, sutures partly closed, frontal and 
parietal eminences well developed, cubic capacity 1,450 (of mustard seed), hori- 
zontal circumference 524, glabello-occipital length 135, minimum frontal diameter 
102, interzygomatic breadth 142, nasio-alveolar length 64, nasal height 48, nasal 
width 23, orbital width 41, orbital height 33. With a length-breadth index of 
85, the measurements are those of a brachycephalic skull with low broad face, 
microseme and almost mesorhine. The normii hifcrnlis .shows an orthognathous 
face with well-formed chin, depressed nasion, well-marked superciliary ridges, 
frontal arc ascending with a uniform steep curve to bregma, behind this there is 
flattening, and then the postero-parietal passes down sharply to the lambda and 
is associated with occipital flattening. 

Altogether the series of skeletal remains gives evidence of a people of some- 
what under medium stature, well-built and athletic, with very broad skulls, low 
straight faces, narrow orbits and somewhat broadish noses. 

As to the affinities of these short cist builders, the characters of their 
skeletons are very similar to those of the broad-headed Alpine race that occupied 
Central Europe about the end of the Stone Age and which ai'e supposed to be 



52G TRAN.SACTIONS OF SECTION H. 

descendants of the Palfpolithic broad-headed Grenille race; in fact, the short 
cist skull approximates closely to the Grenille type of skull. The ceramic found 
in the interments supports this view, for the Hon. John Abercromby has demon- 
strated that the ' beaker ' type of sepulchral urn is the oldest Bronze Age ceramic, 
and that it is an imported type having its centre of dispersion in Central Europe 
at the end of the Stone Age. 



3. The Stone Implements of tlie Australian Aborigine: the Types and 
their Occurrence. By A. S. Kenyon and D. J. Mahont. 

(1) Distribution. — Implements are found all over the land surface; mainly 
at 'camps,' but fortuitously more or less everywhere. ' Gamps ' — which embrace 
kitchen-middens, over-mounds, myrniong-heaps, cave-shelters, &amp;c. — are of several 
classes. The first and most important comprises those which may practically 
be termed permanent, near unfailing water and reliable food supply. Others 
are, in a varying degree, of a temporary nature. These differences are reflected 
in the implements found at them. Temporary occupation, with surroundings 
calling for little or no use of stone implements, produces ' camps ' like those 
on the Coorong Ocean Beach, South Australia, where there is no local stone 
or timber, and the food supply is limited to the mollusc, Doiiax sp. There 
are there thousands of acres of camp exposed ; masses of Donax shells without, 
on the whole surface, more than a dozen shapeless fragments of flint : nothing 
else to show man's presence. The stone remains to be found at camps range 
from such rudimentary, almost unrecognisable, implements to series embracing 
every class to the highest, varying with the district and its available supplies 
of stone and with the situation. 

(2) Period. — The whole of the implements dealt with are of recent age, and 
were fashioned by the race still existing. They occur on the surface or nearly 
so in positions where rapid accumulation is still in progress. No separation 
into layers of varying degrees of workmanship has yet been observed, while a 
mixture of all types is found on top of formations whose age cannot exceed 
a few hundred years. Certainly some stone occurrences which may imply 
iuitiquity have been reported, but they are not dealt with here. 

(3) Motcrial. — The material used varies with requirements and accessibility, 
but for cutting implements it may be readily divided into two clas.ses, brittle 
and hard .stone, such as flints, quartzites, cherts, &amp;c., and the tougher but softer 
diabasic, metamorpliic, and like rocks. Barter is almost wholly confined to the 
latter class, and in it to the better sorts. The brittle stones produce imjilements 
of palaeolithic, and lower, types; the tough stones mainly those of a neolithic 
character. 

(4) Ti/pe. — There is no doubt that the class of stone available governs the 
degree of finish and method of manipulation, with use and opportunity playing 
a secondary part. At Portland, where flints abound along the coast line and 
no other suitable stones occur, the implements of fiint, forming the gre.it 
majority, are of a marked iJalteolithic type; most, if not all, of the types so 
classed in Europe being obtainable. Were these the only indications, it might 
be claimed tluit a rare but little higher than tlie Tasmanian had existed on the 
mainland. On the Upper Goulburn River, wliere there are no flints and no 
quartzitic rocks of a tractable nature, a completely distinct group of implements 
is met with. The river pebbles, flattened ovals in form, are made implements 
by simply chipping around one edge. In the remote interior of the Mallee Scrub, 
w'here good brittle stone is obtainable only from great distances, each fragment 
is used and re-used until a complete series of minute implements of ' pygmy ' 
type is found. Even with such crude and cumbersome implements as stone-mills, 
the same law holds. In proximity to suitable sandst&lt;ine, large roughly broken 
masses of .stone are used, while at a distance the smaller quarried types prevail. 

(.5) Classification. — The first requirement is one system capable of including 
all forms, from the most primitive eolithic to a well-differentiated and fashioned 
neolithic implement. No existing European or American system is applicable, 
as all postulate a relationship between the workmanship and the cultural stage of 
the artificer : this is not justified l&gt;y Australian e\idenre. Consequently the 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION II. 527 

classification adopted is that of Kenyon and Stirling (Royal Society of Victoria, 
vol. xiii. n.s. 1901), with such modifications as later discoveries have rendered 
necessary. This system is founded primarily on use, though form has to be 
relied upon in instances where use is merely conjectural. 

(6) Conclusion. — In Australia at least the type of implement prevailing is no 
reliable index to the type of man who fashioned it, or to his stage of culture, 
or to his period of existence. But for the undeniable evidence as to the con- 
temporary nature of the various camps, the conclusion would be justified that 
they are the remains of former inhabitants of neolithic, palteolithic, and, to 
coin a term, protolithic ages.

2. Recent Excavation of a PalccolitJiic Cave in Jeracij. 
By R. R. Marett, M.A., D.Sc. 

Dining the past three years fruitful exploration of the cave known iis La 
C'otte dc iSt. JJrelade, on the south coast of Jersey, has taken place, and the 
results were laid by me before the British Association at the Portsmouth, 
Dundee, and Birmingham iMeetings. This year for the first time the Briti.sh 
Association has taken an active share in the work by making a grant of 50^., and 
appointing a Committee of control. This latest chapter in the history of the 
excavation may fairly claim to have broken all previous records. 

Hitherto the Mousterian floor liad been cleared only along the west side of tlic 
cave, where about twenty-five feet of superincumbent debris had to be removed. 
It was now resolved to carry the clearing across the mouth to the cast side, 
tiiough this involved the demolition of an overlying mass of no less than forty 
feet, weighing approximately a ton to every square foot of Moor exposed, (.'un- 
siderablo risk from falling stones had to be faced, but only one accident 
occurred, and that foi'tunately not very serious. 

As the east limit was approached, the floor of ancient occupation increased in 
tliickness; so tliat near the wall, which was found to be undercut by a con- 
siderable cavity forming a sort of side-chamber, as much as twelve feet of hearth- 
deposits, rich in bones and implements, were encountered. 

Among the bones a rough preliminary survey reveals the presence of mam- 
moth, woolly rhinoceros, the great Irish elk, reindeer, red deer, roe deer, wild 
ox, wild horse, wild goat, cave-hyaena, fox, arctic lemming, and a species of 
grouse. We have here, then, a thoroughly representative pleistocene fauna of the 
cold, or tundra, type. 

The number of implements obtained may be gathered from the fact that they 
exceeded three cwt. in sheer weight. It will take months of study to do justice 
to the wealth of types which they embody. As far as can be made out at 
present, the Mousterian facies prevails throughout, though it remains to be 
seen whether it will prove possible to differentiate in regard to style of workman- 
ship the products of the various levels of the floor. In the meantime it may 
be pointed out that the characteristic 'point ' was found at all levels; thou"-h 
one of these, gathered at the lowest level, was worked on bofcli sides, thus 
suggesting the technique of an earlier period. Among the smaller implements a 
certain number appeared to be notched towards the base, as if they had once 
been provided with a handle or shaft. There was a great variety of hammer- 
stones, mostly of granite, and of split pebbles, mostly of diabase, some of which 
had clearly been used as polishers. Altogether, this site is so rich that it may 
well come to be treated as the locux classicus for the determination of the leading 
forms of the Mousterian culture; more especially as, to judge from the thickness 
of the implementiferous bed, and the occurrence of double patination upon 



528 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H. 

certain implements, the occupatiun must have extended over an immense period 
of time. 

There is still a great deal of work to be done on this site, and, what is more, 
it promises to be immediately fruitful on both sides of the recent cutting. It 
is to be hoped that the British Association will not hesitate to provide a fresh 
grant, and thus identify itself still further with discoveries that cannot fail to 
make for the advancement of archaeological science. 



3. The Brain of Prbnitive Man. By Professor G. Elliot Smith, F.B.S. 

4. On iJie Bclations of llie Inner Surface of the Cranial Wall lo the 
Brain, wUli special reference to the Beconstruction of the Brain from 
Cranial Casts. By Professor J. Symington, M.D., F.B.S. 

This paper contained the results of a series of observations on the relations of 
the brain and skull with the object of ascertaining the extent to which casts of 
the cranial cavity enable us to estimate the form of the brain and especially the 
])osition of the cerebral fissures and the degree of development of the cerebral 
convolutions. As is well known to anatomists, the bony wall of the cranium is 
separated from the brain by three membranes called the dura mater, the aracli- 
iioid, and the pia mater. As a rule these membranes are thin, but in certain 
situations they may be thickened, or separated from one another; thus, meningeal 
vessels ramify on the outer surface of the dura mater, and certain venous 
channels, some of considerable size, are situated in the dura mater, while be- 
tween the arachnoid and the pia mater is the cerebrospinal Huid, and the larger 
cerebral vessels lie in the subarachnoid space and the smaller ones in the pia 
mater. 

In a series of specimens in which the brain had been carefully hardened 
171 situ the cranial cavity was opened and the brain divided in a horizontal, 
transverse vertical, or median direction. Plaster of Paris or gelatine casts were 
taken of part of the cranial cavity, first with the dura mater hi situ and secondly 
after removal of this membrane. Moulds were also made of the part of the 
brain which occupied the portion of the cranial cavity from which casts had 
been taken. These moulds of the brain were made with the arachnoid and pia 
mater in position and also after their removal, and from them casts were pre- 
pared. One complete set of such casts consisted of (1) the iinier surface of the 
bony wall of the skull, (2) the inner surface of the dura mater, (3) the outer 
surface of the arachnoid, and (4) the outer surface of the bi'ain. 

In thirteen adult subjects the vault of the skull and its contents, and in two 
the parts behind the foramen magnum, were examined, and in three the head 
was divided in the median plane and the lateral halves cast. With the aid of 
this material not only could the form of the brain and of the cranial cavity be 
compared, but the structures to which were due any differences between them 
could easily be demonstrated. 

The results of this investigation showed that only the general fuim and size 
of the brain and the position of but few of its fissures and convolutions could be 
ascertained from the bony cranial casts, and that the simplicity or complexity of 
the cerebral convolutions could Jiot be inferred from the feeble or marked 
development of the digital impressions on the inner surface of the cranial wall. 
These observations tend to throw grave doubts on the reliability of certain state- 
ments with reference to the peculiarities of the Piltdown brain based upon casts 
of the Piltdown cranium. 



5. Bori Exorcism, Fortune-telling, and Invocation. 
By Major A. J. N. Tremearne, M.A., LL.M. 

A woman in Tunis had been ill for seven months, her body so lax that she 
could do nothing. After four and a half months she had given one franc, to be 
wrapped in a handkerchief and hung in the bori temple as an offering to Kuri. 
She got a little better, and at the end of the seventh month gave a dance. Her 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION 11. 529 

illness was transferred to two fowls, which were tlien killed, and various bori 
came and entered the dancers. The patient was so much benefited that she was 
able to dance herself by midnight, and was walking about next day. 

The (jodii/a (' mare ') having become affected by the inhalation of incense 
gave oracles and answered the questions asked. Several spirits mounted. During 
the inhalation the priestesses rubbed the ground, and during the possession of 
the goditja they knelt and received albaraka. An' incantation was sung to each 
spirit on arrival by a special songstress. 

When a person is going on a journey, fowls may be sacrificed after an invoca- 
tion to the bori, and the blood flowing between the traveller's legs brings the bori, 
who give their albarakn. By the manner in which the blood flows and by its 
appearance the success of the venture may be foretold.

1. Is Auslralian Cullure iSiinpla or Complex? 
By Dr. W. H. R. Eivehs, F.B.S. 

The question whether Australian culture is simple or complex is one of 
great theoretical iniportaiice. If this culture does not represent a stage in, 
or an offshoot from, a direct line of social development, but is the result 
of the fusion of a number of elemeut.s which reached Australia at long 
intervals, the first step towards any sound knowledge must be the analysis 
of this culture. If such features of Australian culture as its totemism, its 
belief in the reincarnation of the dead, and its practices of mutilation are 
not independent developments, but the results of influences brought to Australia 
from elsewhere, perhaps in relatively recent times and by people whose culture 
was of a higher order than that now found in Australia, the foundation on 
which many recent anthropological speculations have been reared is swept away. 

In considering this question, the first point to be noted is that it i."^ 
impossible to decide whether any culture is simple or complex by a study 
of that culture alone. It is only by comparison with neighbouring and allied 
cultures that the problem can be settled. The first question, therefore, which 
must be asked is whether any culture allied to that of Australia exists in its 
neighbourhood, and there can be no question that Melanesia possesses such a 
culture. Superficially the two are very different, but the more one studies 
those .aspects of culture which do not lie on the surface, such as social 
structure and religion, the more apparent does the close relation between 
the two become. The complexity of Melanesian culture is evident, and the 
results of an attempt i to analyse this complexity leave little doubt that some 
of the elements which resemble those of Australia most closely have been 
brought from elsewhere or have arisen out of the interaction between the 
indigenous and immigrant peoples. 

Further, it is almost, if not quite, certain that the cultures which have 
reached Melanesia from without have come from the west, the immediate centre 
of dispersion having been the Malay Archipelago, and it is evident that the 
same influences have reached the remotest parts of Polynesia, as well as 
Madagascar. It seems hardly possible that migrant peoples setting out 
from the Malay Archipelago and reaching such remote islands as Hawaii, 
Easter Island, New Zealand, New Caledonia, and Madagascar, can have 
failed to reach and influence a vast continent which lies quite near their 
home. It is probable that the main path of movements eastward from Malaysia 
lies north of New Guinea, and Australia might thus have escaped, but even if 
it be conceded that all the movements so passed, and this is most unlikely, the 

' Rivers, Hhfory of Melanesian Society, Cambridge, 1914. 
1914. , ■ MM 



530 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H. 

advocates of unity would be in no better case, for it is certain tliat the 
migrants turned tlie south-eastern corner of New Guinea and passed west- 
wards. Culture-movements which passed in this direction as far as the Fly 
River of New Guinea are not likely to have escaped Australia. 

It is a most important point that these migrants must have been seafarers 
and would have reached Australia by sea. Seafarers so enterpri.sing that they 
reached Easter Island and Madagascar are not likely to have been content 
to invade Australia at one point ; they would have coasted far in search 
of favoinable settling-places. One reason why so many students have been 
blind to the possibility of external influence in Australia is that they have 
pictured the process as the sweeping of an invading host across the continent. 
The history of Austi-alian culture and its present nature become far easier 
to understand if there has been a gradual infiltration of seafaring peoples, 
starting from many points on the coast ; if immigrants, few in number, first 
formed small settlements on the coast and passed on their culture to the 
interior of the continent by gradual secondary movements.^ 

One difficulty which confronts this view is the apparently primitive charac- 
ter of the seafaring vessels of Australia. The view I put forward can only 
stand if there has taken place in this region that degeneration and even loss 
of so useful an object as the canoe of which we have definite evidence in 
^Melanesia and Polynesia. ^ 

The complexity of Australian culture will only be established when the 
facts of Melanesian, Papuan, and Australian culture have been fitted into a 
common scheme, and I may consider here one feature of culture to illustrate 
the kind of process by which this object may be attained. The analysis of 
Melanesian culture has shown " that certain main varieties of the modes of 
treating the bodies of the dead can be ascribed to immigrant peoples. This 
ascription rests partly on the distribution of these modes of disposal; partly 
on the association of these modes with other elements of culture ; partly un 
. the use of different modes by chiefs and commoners. The chief modes of 
disposal of the dead which occur in Melanesia are also found in Australia. 
In order to prove that the two sets of customs have had a common origin, it 
will be necessary to show that the Australian modes of treating the dead 
are associated with those elements of culture with which they occur in 
Melanesia. 

The object of this introduction is to state a problem and to put forward 
certain facts and principles which must be taken into account in attemjiting 
its solution. The history of Australian culture can only be learnt by a study 
of the distribution of its elements of culture in which far more attention 
is paid to the details of social structure and religious practice than has liitherto 
been given by advocates of Australian complexity.

One of the greatest factors in the Roman conquest of Italy and of the Roman

The earliest beginnings of this system may be traced in the immediate neighbour-

at the Birmingham Meeting of researches along the Via Appia and the Via 
Traiana, and in continuance of it the remainder of the road system of South 
Italy is now described, as the result of actual exploration on the spot, the 
line of the ancient roads being traced and followed as far as possible — an enter-

2, Preliminary Communication on an Australian Cranium oj probable 
Pleistocene Age. By Professors T. W. Edgewobth David, 
C.M.G., F.R.S., and J. T. Wilson, F.R.S. 

Professor T. W. Edgeworth David stated that the skull exhibited belonged to 
Mr. E. C. Crawford, of Greenthorpe, New South Wales, who obtained it from 
a stockman, who found it in the bed of Talgai Creek, near Clifton, on the 
Darling Downs of Queensland. It appears to have been washed out of the 
black soils of the Darling Downs. A few miles from the spot where the skull 
was picked up bones of many types of extinct mammalia of Pleistocene Age 
have been discovered, and as the present skull is in at least as advanced a stage 
of fossilisation as the bones of Diprotodon, Nototherium, etc., in adjacent 
regions, it may provisionally be assumed that this human skull is also of Pleisto- 
cene Age. The distortion caused by steady pressure due to the weight of an 
original thick overburden of clay is in harmony with the evidence as to the 
high antiquity of the skull. 

While thei-e is a strong probability of this fossil skull being of Pleistocene 
Age, perhaps early Pleistocene, its exact age obviously cannot be determined 
until further evidence can be adduced which may directly connect it with the 
mammalian bone-bearing clays of the Darling Downs. Certainly it is far older 
than any aboriginal skulls that have ever been obtained in Australasia, and it 
proves that in Australia man attained to geological antiquity.

1. Gerontocracy and Marriage in Australia. 
By Dr. W. H. E. Eivers, F.R.S. 
Certain peculiar forms of marriage which occur in Melanesia, suA as 
marriage with the granddaughter of the brother, with the wife of the mother's 
brother, and with the wife of the father's father, are capable of explanation 
as the result of a state of dominance of the old men, which allowed them to 
monopolise all the young women of the community.^ Since Australia fm-nishes 
an example of a gerontocracy in which the old men are known to monopolise 
the young women, we should expect to find these peculiar marriages in 
Australia. Until now, however, only one has been recorded, the Dieri marrying 
the granddaughter of the brother,^ but Baldwin Spencer has recently recorded 
others in the Northern Territory.* Wives are transferred to the sisters' sons 
(as well as to the sons) in the Kakadu tribe, while nearly all the systems of 
relationship collected in the Northern Territory show the presence of marriage 
with the wife of the father's father, sometimes combined, as in Melanesia, with

the cross-coiisin marriage. All the forms of marriage which would lie the 
natural result of monopoly of the young women by the old men are thus now- 
known to accompany the gerontocracy of Australia. 



2. Varieties of Totemism in Australia. By A. R. Brown. 

For the purposes of this paper totemism is defined as a special magico-religious 
relation between an individual or a social group, on the one hand, and a class 
of natural objects, generally a species of animal or plant, on the other. 

Considering first of all the nature of the totemic group we can distinguish the 
following different kinds of totemism in Australia : — 

(1) Clan totemism with feinale descent. The totemic group is a body of rela- 
tives who form a clan. Every child belongs to the same totemic group as his 
mother. This form of totemism is found in many tribes in the eastern part of 
Australia, such as the Kamilaroi. 

(2) Clan totemism ivith male descent. The totemic group is a body of rela- 
tives. A child belongs to the same group as his father. This form of totemism 
seems to exist in widely scattered regions of Australia ; for example, in the 
Kariera tribe of Western Australia, in some of the tribes of the Northern 
Territory, in the Narinyeri tribe of South Australia, and perhaps in some tribes 
of Victoria and the southern part of New South Wales. 

(3) Local group totemism.. The totemic group is a body of persons living in 
the same place and collectively owning and occupying a definite portion of the 
tribal territory. The group is not a clan and is not exogamous. A child belongs 
to the same local and totemic group as his father. This form of totemism is 
found in the Jiiirduna tribe of Western Australia, and in a number of neighbour- 
ing tribes. 

(4) Cult society totemism. The totemic group i.s a body of persons who are 
all qualified to take part in a certain cult. The best known example of such 
totemism is that found in the Aranda tribe of Central Australia. 

(5) Totemism. of the dual division. The tribe is divided into two parts or 
moieties, and each part is associated with some species of natural object, as 
eaglehawk and crow in some tribes 

(6) Totemism of relationship divisions. The totemic groups are the four 
sections or the eight sub-sections into which the tribe is divided by the system 
of relationship. One variety of this form of totemism is found in the Pita-pita 
and other tribes of Western Queensland. Another variety is found in the 
Mungarai and Punaba and other tribes of the Northern Territory and Western 
Australia. A third variety is found in the tribes at the head of the Gascoyne 
and Ashburton Rivers in Western Australia. 

(7) Sex totemism. The tribe is divided into two parts, males and females, 
all the males having a special relation to one species of bird or plant, w-hile all the 
females have a similar relation to a different species. 

(8) Personal totemism. The individual has a special and purely personal 
relation to some one or more species of natural objects. In the best-known form, 
that of the Yualai tribe of New South Wales, only medicine-men and women 
with special magical powers have personal totems. 

Considering now the nature of the relation between the group or the person 
and its or his totem, we may distinguish three main kinds of totemism according 
as we find (1) a definite positive ritual associated with the totem, (2) a negative 
ritual, or (3) no organised ritual at all. 

Two main types of positive ritual have so far been described. One of these I 
propose to speak of as the Talu cult, from the name of the ceremonies in a 
number of tribes of Western Australia. Each totem has a special spot sacred to 
it, which we may call the 'totem centre.' At this spot memliers of the totemic 
group perform ceremonies that are believed to result in an increase in the 
numbers of the totemic species. A totemic cult of this type is found over a 
large part of Western Australia, over a part of the Northern Territory, and in 
South Australia in the Arabana and Dieri tribes. It is found associated with 
clan totemism with male descent, with local group totemism, and with cult 
society totemism. 

Another type of totemic cult I propose to speak of by the name Thuthu, by 



TKANSACTION.S OF SECTION H. 533 

wliicli it is kiiuwii ill the Waranuiiiga tribe. The ceremonies of this cult are not 
Jocalised, but may be performed anywliere. Each ceremony consists of a repre- 
sentation of the totemic ancestors of the grouj) and of some of their actions. This 
cult has so far only been recorded from the Northern Territory and South 
Australia. It exists side by side with the Talu cult in the Aranda tribe, and 
also in the Waramunga tribe, where, it would seem, the Talu cult is unknown. 

There are hints of the former existence of a cult perhaps similar to the 
Thuthu cult in some of the tribes of New South Wales, as, for instance, the 
Yualai. 

As regards negative ritual this usually takes the form of a prohibition against 
killing or eating the totem. In the Aranda tribe a man may not eat his own 
totem, i.e. the totem of the cult society to which he belongs, except on certain 
ritual occasions. In Western Australia, in tlie tribes with clan totemism and 
local group totemism (Kariera and Burduna) a man may freely kill and eat his 
own totem. In the tribes of the east of Australia with totemic clans, witli female 
descent the general rule would seem to be that a man may eat his own totem, but 
he must respect it. For instance, he would only eat it if there were nothing 
else and he was hungry, and he would express sorrow at having to eat it. 

In Western Queensland a member of a relationship section may not eat any 
of tjie animals that are the totems of his section, though he may eat those 
belonging to the section of his father or liis mother or liis wife. In the Yualai 
tribe a man niay not eat his own personal totem. 

In the case of sex totemism there is a sort of reversed negative ritual. A 
woman may not kill the totem of the men, or the men will be angry, and 
vice vrr.&lt;n, 

111 the case of the totems of the dual division it would seem that in general 
there is no ritual, positive or negative. 

Taking these distinctions as the basis of a classification we may consider 
itriefly a few of the types of totemic organisation about which we have most 
information. 

Kariera Type. — Totemic clans with male descent. Each clan has a number 
(if totems (nuilti|)le totems). Cult of the Talu type. No proliibition against 
killing or eating the totem. 

Biirdiimi Tijiie. — ^Local group totemism. Each local group has one or more 
totems. Cult of the Talu type. No prohibition against killing and eating the 
totem. The local groups are united into inter-tribal totemic divisions, all groups 
having the same totem being included in the same division. 

I'inuihfi or Minu/firfii Type. — Each of the eight sub-sections into which the 
tribe is divided has one or more totems. 

Anulu Type. — Totemic clans with male descent. Totemic cult of the Talu 
type. A man may not eat his own totem, and may only eat sparingly of his 
mother's totem. 

Warainunefa Type. — Totemic clans with male descent. Thuthu cult, but no 
Talu cult. A man may not eat his own totem. 

Araiula Type. — Totemism of cult societies, membership of the totemic group 
being determined by the locality near which the individual was conceived by his 
mother. Cult of the Talu type. A man may not eat his totem. 

Pita-pita Type. — Each of the four sections of the tribe has a number of 
totems. No positive cult recorded. A man may not eat his own totem. 

Yualai Type. — Clan totemism with female descent. Each clan has one chief 
totem and a number of subsidiary totems. Probably there is a cult of the 
Thuthu type. A person may eat his clan totem. Personal totems of men and 
women with magical powers. A person may not eat his personal totem. 

Dieri Type. — Clan totemism with female descent. No cult of these totems 
(madii) recorded. Also clan totemism with male descent, in connection with 
which there are ceremonies of the Talu type. 



3. Bone Nature MyHi?. from Samoa. By Rev. George Brown, D.D. 

As regards the manner in whicli these myths were collected, it was stated 
tljat they were written about fifty years ago by a Samoan poet, in his own hand- 
writing and without any communication with white men. 



534 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H. 

The iiiylhs neleLted were those dealing with the war between birds and fishes. 
These were supplemented by the native account of the Palolo (Palulo virulis), 
showing the way in which the Samoans calculate the time when that annelid 
appears. The paper was intended to show the development of the mind of men, 
in primitive conditions of life, from ' animatism ' to 'animism,' and onwards 
again to ' natural science,' after many years of close observation of natural 
phenomena. 

4. The Anv'iciil Jnliabilaids of Egypt and the Siulaii. Bij Professor 
G. Elliot Smith, M.4., M.D., F.R.S. 

This communication dealt with new material bearing upon the racial charac- 
teristics of two groups of the earliest people, the most northern and the most 
southern, whose remains have yet come to light in the Nile Valley — (a) one a 
series of Protodynastic skeletons obtained from various sources within forty 
miles of Cairo, and {b) another set recovered by Dr. Reisner near Merowe, many 
hundreds of miles further south, in the Sudan. 

(n) The evidence of the first series supplements the information which the 
author has laid before the Association from time to time during recent years, and 
seems to indicate that the alien element in the Protodynastic population of Lower 
Egypt can be recognised as early as the time of the P'irst Dynasty. It raises 
the possibility that from an even more remote period the people of the Delta 
may have been intermingling with a foreign population not belonging to the 
Brown Race. Moreover, the general diffusion of alien traits in the people of 
Memphis by the time of the Second Dynasty and the complete gradation of 
types intermediate between the typical Proto-Egyptian of Upper Egypt and the 
Syrian of Western Asia suggests a long process of intermingling of these two 
peoples in Lower Egypt before that time. 

(6) The interesting material from the Sudan was obtained last year by Dr. 
Reisner at the southern end of the Kerma basin. It belongs to the Hyksos 
period, when large numbers of Egyptians emigrated into the Sudan. The 
skeletons obtained from the better tombs closely resemble those of typical 
Egyptians of the upper class, such as commonly occur in Upper Egypt from 
about the time of the Vlth Dynasty onwards. But many of the other skeletons 
conform to the Proto-Egyptian and Middle Nubian (C group) types. Although 
none of the skeletons exhibit pronounced negroid traits, the majority of them 
bear indubitable evidence of some negro admixture, though in all cases it has 
affected the Egyptian or Nubian features only to a very slight degree.

6. A Fundamental Problem of Religious Sociology. 
By B. Malinowski, Ph.D. 

There are certain questions of principle in every branch of science which 
cannot be passed over in any comprehensive and thorough treatment of the 
subject, and upon the answer of which the further course of inquiry essentially 
depends. 

Such questions are, as a rule, the most difficult to settle, because only an 
overwhelming amount of evidence gathered with the very problem in view 
allows of an unequivocal answer. In anthropology the mutual co-operation of 
the theorist and of the field-worker is essential in all such cases. 

A question of this type presents itself at the outset in anthropological investi- 
gations of religion. Is there a sharp and deep cleavage between religious and 
jnofane matters among primitive peoples ? Or, in other words : Is there a 
pronounced dualism in the social and mental life of the savage, or, on the 
contrary, do the religious and non-religious ideas and activities pass and shade 
into each other in a contiimous manner ? • 

This question is of utmost importance for the general theory of religion. 



TRANSACTIONS OF BEOTTON H. fiSf) 

Professor Dnrkheim postulates the existence of a perfectly sharp and deep 
cleavage between the two domains of the aacn' and profane, and his entiie 
theoretical construction stands and falls witli this assumption.' Again, Dr. 
Marett is of opinion that, generally speaking, ' the savage is very far from 
having any fairly definite system of ideas of a magico-religious kind, with a 
somewhat specialised department of conduct corresponding thereto.'^ 

This view, although expressed in a somewhat different connection, un- 
doubtedly implies the negation of Durkheim's dogmatic standpoint. Again, 
Mr. Crawley thinks, that for the savage everything has got a religious dimen- 
sion,' a view which also excludes the existence of any irreducible dualism of 
magico-rdigious on the one hand and secular on the other. 

These examples show that the above question, fundamental as it is, is still 
ansettled and controversial. What answer does it I'eceive from the ethnographic 
evidence ? The great Australian ethnographers, Spencer and Gillen, whose 
researches have contributed to the advancement of our knowledge of primitive 
religion more than any other investigations, answer the question in the affirma- 
tive. The life of an aborigine of Central Australia is sharply divided into two 
periods : the one comprising his everyday life, and the other his magico-religious 
activities.'' It is evident throughout Messrs. Spencer and Gillen's two volumes 
that the properly religious and magical practices and beliefs are strictly esoteric ; 
that they are fenced off from everyday life by a wall of taboos, rules, and 
ob.servances. Yet reading another standard work of modern anthropology, Dr. 
and Mrs. Seligman's monograph on the Veddas, one gets the impression that 
MTnong these natives there does not exist anything like a radical bipartition of 
things and ideas into religious and profane. 

Again, the views held by another recent investigator. Dr. Thurnwald, with 
regard to the magic of the natives of the Bismarck Archipelago and of the 
Solomon Islands, imply beyond doubt the absence of a clear-cut division between 
magico-religious and secular ideas,"' the two classes merging into and blendino- 
with each other. 

One conclusion seems to be inevitable : namely, that pending new evidence 
it would be ra.sh to dogmatise on the subject under consideration. I venture to 
say more. The above-mentioned statements (which could easily be multiplied) 
point not merely to different personal equations, which, however, would be pos- 
sible in such an enormously complex and general problem, but they point to 
real differences in the matter discussed. The consolidation of the religious life 
can be different amongst various peoples, depending as it does upon various 
social conditions. Thus religion seems to be best developed and possessing the 
highest relative social importance among the Central Australians, to a smaller 
degree among the Papuans studied by Thurnwald, still less among the Veddas. 
Where it is stronge.st the bipartition postulated by Durkheim seems to be most 
prominent. Wherever it is less pronounced the two domains shade into each 
other and beigin to fuse. 

Thus probably the division into religious and inofane is not an essential and 
fundamental feature of religion, suitable to be considered as its very distinctive 
characteristic. It is an accidental feature, dependent chiefly upon the social 
part played by religion and connected possibly with some other factors, to deter- 
mine the influence of which it is, however, necessary to have more nniple 
evidence, gathered with the problem in view.

FBI DAY, AUGUST 14. 

The President ck4ivered the following Address : — 

T/ic Value of Fr.^carcli in the Derelopmcnt of National Health. 
The history of medical science presents to the curious student a remarkalile 
development commencing in the latter half of the nineteentli century, and one 
worthy of special study, both on account of the light that it shed.s on tiie 
present position and the illumination it affords for future progress. 

If any text-book of medicine or treatise on any brancli of medical science 
written before 1850 be taken up at random its pages will reveal that it differs but 
little from one written a full century earlier. If such a volume be compared 
with one written thirty-five years later, it will be found that the whole outlook 
and aspect of medicine have changed within a generation. 

Erroneous introspective dreams as to the nature of diseases, as ' idiopathic ' 
as the many strange maladies which their authors are so fond of describing have 
been replaced by fast-proven facts, and medicine has passed from an occult craft 
into an exact science based upon experimental inquiry and logical deduction from 
observation. 

What caused this rapid spring of growth, after the long latent period of 
centuries, and are we now reaching the end of the new era in medicine, or do 
fresh discoveries still await the patient experimentalist with a trained imagina- 
tion who knows both how to dream and how to test his dreams ? 

It is but a crude comparison that represents the earlier age as one of 
empiricism and imagination, and the later period as one of induction and experi- 
ment. Empiricism has always been of high value in science, it will ever remain 
so, and some of the richest discoveries in science have arisen empirically. 

Imagination also is as essential to the highest scientific work to-day as it was 
a century ago, and throughout all time the work of the genius is characterised 
in all spheres of human endeavour by the breadth and flight of the imagination 
which it .shows. The great scientist, whether he be a mathematician, a physicist, 
a chemist, or a physiologist, requires imagination to pierce forward into the 
unknown, just as truly as does the great poet or artist. Also, the inspired 
work of poet or painter must be concordant with a system of facts or conven- 
tions, and not outrage certain canons of his art, as certainly as the true and 
lasting work of the scientist must accurately accord with natural laws. 

The scientist is as little able to prove the fundamental truth or existence 
of the groundwork upon which modern physical, chemical, and physiological 
theories are built, as the artist is to prove the ethics, or perfect truth, or perfect 
beauty, of those conventions upon which poetry, painting, or that great group 
of studies termed the ' humanities ' find their basis. But the artist or 
philosopher knows that, using these conventions as the best at present discovered. 



538 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION I. 

lie can prnrhice works of wliicli the beauty and consistency appeal to all 
educated human minds capable of appreciation. Similarly, tbe conventions of 
natural science, properly understood, appeal to tbe imagination of tbe scientist, 
call forth new ideas to his mind, and suggest fresh experiments to test those 
ideas ; or, a chance empirical observation of an experimental nature, which 
without theory and scientific imagination would remain isolated and sterile, 
placed in relationship to the rest of the scheme of science, awakens thought, 
and may lead to a fresh departure and a long train of important discoveries. 

It was this correlation of the imagination with experimentation and the 
tracing out of relationship from point to point so as to develop the evolution 
of phenomena that characterised the science of medicine when new-born about 
seventy years ago, and differentiated it from the older nosological medicine in 
which imagination and experimentation, while both existing, seemed to possess 
independent existences and pay little regard the one to the other. 

It seems well-nigh forgotten nowadays by the majority of people that 
science and religion originally began together from a common thirst for know- 
ledge, and usually in the same type of mind endowed with a divine curiosity 
to know more of the origin and nature of things. 

Every great religion worthy of the name contains some account of the natural 
history and creation of the world, in addition to its metaphysical aspects, and 
reflects the degree of knowledge of natural science possessed by the nation in 
which it arose at the time of its birth. 

The fundamental error throughout the ages of human conceptions both in 
science and religion was that of a non-progressive world to which a stereotyped 
religion, or science, could be adapted for all time. Perfection was imaged 
where perfection, we are now happy to realise, was impossible, and, believing in 
this imaginary perfection and that all things new deviating from it were damn- 
able, men were prepared to burn one another at tbe stake rather than allow error 
to creep into the world in either science or religion. Thus there have been 
martyrs for the scientific conscience just as for religious belief, and at this 
distance in time we can perhaps better understand both inquisitor and martyr 
and realise that both were fighting for great ideals. 

Evolution has taught us that as knowledge broadens we must be prepared 
to have wider vision and abandon old theories and beliefs in the new-born light 
that makes the world better to-day than it was yesterdaj', and that also will 
.show things up to our mental vision more clearly to-morrow than they stand 
out to-day. To the members of any great craft, or profession, or religious order, 
this scientific outlook, which accepts as fundamental a progressive world and 
insists that its votaries should adapt their lives to such a doctrine, is peculiarly 
difficult of assimilation. Routine fixes all men, and so when any new discovery 
appears to demand change from that order to which the mind has become 
accustomed, it is immediately looked upon with suspicion, and there being little 
plasticity of mind remaining, it is rejected as heretical or revolutionary after 
but scanty critical examination. The cry of the craft in danger has been used 
efficaciously on many occasions since the days of the Ephesian silversmiths, 
nor is such a cry at once to be set down to pure selfishness. A craft is often 
worth preserving long after the forces which have called it into being have 
commenced to slumber, and conservatism of this type is at times an important 
factor in social progress. However, there are certain limits which must not 
be surpassed, room must be made by adaptation for the new knowledge, or it will 
establish a craft of its own iconoclastic to much worth preserving in the older 
system. 

It is important to insist upon these limitations, because a too reactionary 
spirit abroad in medicine between 1860 and 1880 prevented the world from 
benefiting from those remarkable discoveries by Pasteur and their proposed 
applications by Lister, which laid the foinidations of modern medicine and 
modern surgery. These pioneers of the new age in medical science had to wage 
for many years a stern and bitter fight against the strong forces of ignorance 
and prejudice. But for this illogical resistance by men who would not even 
test the new discoveries, and instead spent their time in sneering at the new 
geniuses who had leadership to give the world, France and Germany would 
liave been saved manv thousands of brave lives in the great war of 1870-71. 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 539 

Even llicicaitcr, tlif slow sU'uyglc cojitiuucd of tlic few wliu Ujicw a,gaiiist Uie 
iiiiiiiy who refused lo be taught, and a perusal of any orthodox text-book of 
niedicine published between 1875-80— that is, more than a decade after Pasteur's 
great discovery — will show that the etiology of scarcely a single infectious disease 
had become known, and that medical science was, for example, as ignorant 
of the nature of tuberculosis as we are to-day of the nature of carcinoma. 
Take, as an example, the following quotation from a well-known text-book of 
the theory and practice of medicine published in 1876 : ' It is now, however, 
generally admitted that tubercle is no mere deposit, but, on the contrary, a 
living growth as much as sarcoma and carcinoma are living growths.' Tho 
tubercles were the only initial lesion observed, the infecting organism was 
entirely unknown, and the pathologists of this comparatively recent date argued 
at length as to whether tubercles were to be classed as ' adenomata ' or were 
something sui generis. 

There is a gleam of sunlight tor the future in this retrospect at the ignor- 
ance of the past, for, if men were as ignorant regarding tuberculosis thirty-eight 
years ago as to-day they are about cancer, then it may be argued that a genera- 
tion hence as mucli may be known about cancer as is known now about tubercu- 
losis. 

It is particularly important at the present moment, when so much interest 
is being taken in national health, to point out the urgent necessity of allowing 
as little lagging behind as possible to ensue between the making of discoveries 
and the practical application of the results by organised national effort for the 
well-being of the whole commiuiity. 

It must sadly be admitted that it is craftsmanship in imaginary danger 
fighting hard for the old methods unchanged which were in vogue fifty years 
ago, that stands most prominently in the way of advance. As great a harvest 
as that which followed the application of the principle of antisepsis in surgery 
awaits the application of the self -same principle in national sanitation to-day. 
but the very profession which ought to be urging forward the new era 
apparently stands in dread of it, and seems to prefer to reap its harvest from 
disease rather than to seize the noble heritage won for it by the research of 
pioneers and so stand forth to the world as the ministry of health. Fortunately 
it cannot be, the bourne has been passed, and there is no going backward. The 
advances that have already been made have awakened statesmen and people 
alike to the needs of the situation, and all have resolved to be disease-ridden 
no longer. The laws of health must be made known to tlie people at large, and 
schemes laid before them for a national organisation for the elimination of 
disease. Disease is no longer an affair of the medical profession, it is a national 
concern of vital importance. The problem is not a class question, all humanity 
stands face to face with it now in the light of modern research as it never has 
faced it before. It has been realised that disease never can be conquered by 
private bargains for fees between individual patient and individual doctor. 
Kesearch into diseases of unknown causation cannot be subsidised upon such 
individualistic lines, and in the case of diseases of known etiology and modes 
of propagation the passage of disease from individual to individual cannot be 
controlled by such private methods as that of the afflicted individual subsidising 
the doctor for his own protection. Cost what it may, a healthy environment 
must be produced for the whole mass of the population, and the laws of 
physiology and hygiene must be taught not only to medical students, but to 
every child in every school in the country. People cannot live healthy lives in 
ignorance of the fundamental laws of health merely by paying casual visits to 
physicians, and no one class in the community can be healthy until all classes 
are healthy. 

The problem of national health is one of peculiar interest to physiologists, 
and to the exponents of those experimental branches of medical science which 
have sprung from the loins of physiology, for it was with them that the new 
science of medicine of the last fifty years arose, and they ought to be the leaders 
of the world in this most important of all mundane problems. 

It is well worth while to consider our opportunities and responsibilities and 
raise the questioTi whether our present system and organisation are the most 
suitable for attaining one of the most sublime ambitions that ever appealed to 



'540 TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION I. 

any profession. By definition, our science studies the laws of health and the 
functions of the healthy body, therefore it is ours to lead in the quest for health. 
Is this object best achieved if we confine ourselves to research in our labora- 
tories, and to the teaching of the principles of physiology to medical students, 
while we leave the community as a whole uninstructed as to the objects of our 
research and its value to every man, and trust the medical students whom we 
turn out to communicate, or not communicate as they choose, the results 
of their training and our re.search to the world at large ? 

There is little question that much of the ignorance abroad in the world, 
and much of the fatuous opposition to our experimental work and research, arise 
from tliis aloofness of ours. Here also lies the cause of much of the latent 
period in the application of acquired knowledge to great sociological problems, 
and the presence of untold sickness and death which could be easily prevented 
if only a scientific .system of dealing with disease could be evolved. 

The position occupied by scientists in medicine at the present day is largely 
that of .schoolmasters to a medical guild, and even at that, one construtted upon 
lines which have grown antiquated by the progre.s.s of medical science. It ouglit 
now to become the function of the scientist to re-model the whole system so as 
to fight disease at its source. The whole situation at the moment calls out 
for such a movement. On the one hand, there exists a widespread interest on 
tile part of an awakened community in health questions, evidenced by recent 
legislation dealing with the health of schoolcliildreii, with the health of the 
worker, with the sanitary condition of workshops, with the questions of 
maternity and infant mortality, and with the communication of infectious 
diseases. On the other hand, there is chaos in the medical organisation to meet 
all these new demands, and the ample means recently placed at the command of 
the nation and of municipal authorities are being largely wasted by overlapping 
and misdirection for lack of skilled leadership. Surely it is a time when those 
who have laid the scientific foundations for the new advances should take 
counsel together, assume some generalship, and show how the combat is to be 
waged, not as a guerilla warfare, but as an organised and coordinated campaign. 

There are two essentials in the inception of this organised campaign against 
disease on a scientific basis. Tlie first is to demonstrate clearly to the public 
mind that modern scientific medicine arose from the experimental or researcli 
method, that it was only when experimental observation of the laws of healtli 
and disease, in animals and man, commenced on an organised and broadcast 
basis that medicine and surgery leai)ed forward and the remarkable achieve- 
ments of the past fifty years began. Also that it is only by the organisation 
and endowment of medical research that future discovery and advancement 
are possible. The second essential is to convince the public that a national 
system must be evolved placing medical science and medical practice in co- 
ordination, so that the discoveries of science may be adequately applied in an 
organised scheme for the prevention and treatment of disease. The method in 
which discoveries have been made in the past suggests an amplification and 
organisation along similar lines for the future, and the banishment of many 
diseases by public health work in the past suggests that it is more efficiently 
organised and wide-spread public health work in the future, extended from the 
physical environment to the infecting individual, that will be most fruitful in 
banishing other diseases. 

If it be queried by anyone here, what has physiology to do with disease, it 
may be replied that the question comes at least fifty years too late. Tlie 
methods evolved first by physiologists in experimentation upon animals have 
become the methods of all the exact sciences in medicine. Bacteriology is tlie 
physiology of the bacterium, and the study of protozoan diseases the physiology 
of certain groups of protozoa. Organo-therapy had its origin in physiology, and 
many of its most brilliant discoveries were made by physiologists, and all by 
scientists who used physiological methods. Serum therapy, experimental 
pharmacology, and the great problems of immunity all arose from the labours 
of men ^ with expert training in physiology who branched out into practical 
applications achieved by the extension of the experimental, or research, method.

mothnd ? From tlip flnys of tlie first siirressfnl alxlominiil opei'ation to tlio 
present clay, reseanh in laboratory or in tlie operating theatre has pioneered 
the way, and the sooner this simple trntli is known to all men the better for 
medical science. Every time any surgeon first tries a new operation there is in 
it an element of experiment and research of which the ethical limits are well- 
known and definable, and any person who logically thinks the matter out must 
see that it is the research method which has placed the science and art of 
surgery where it stands to-day. Exactly the same thesis holds for medicine. 
How could any physician predict for the first time, before he had tried it 
experimentally on animal or man, the action of any new drug, the effect of any 
variation in dosage, the result of any dietary, of the employment of any course 
of physical or chemical treatment, or of anything in the whole of his armamen- 
tarium ? Yet the public are rarely told any of these wholesale truths, but are 
rather left to speculate that each medical and surgical fact sprang forth as a 
kind of revelation in the inner consciousness of some past genius in medicine 
or surgery, who, in some occult way, knew of his own certain foreknowledge 
what would be the definite effect of some remedy or course of treatment before 
he tried it for the first time on a patient, or perhaps had the ethical conscience 
and genuine humanity to test it on a lower animal before he administered it to 
man. 

It may, in short, be taken as an axiom of medical science that everything 
of value in medicine and surgery has arisen from the applications of experimental 
research. Nor can future advance be made by any other method than the 
research method. It is true that accident may teach occasionally, as it did, for 
example, in the dreadful burns unwittingly inflicted on themselves and patients 
by the early experimenters in X-ray therapy and diagnosis. But accident is 
only the most blundering type of experimentation, and results obtained by its 
chance agency do not really invalidate the universal law that man only learns 
by experience or, in other words, by research. Research is, after all, only the 
acquisition of fresh experience by the trained expert, usually led on to his 
experiment by inductance from other known facts. 

It has been said above that all that is valuable in medical science has been 
acquired by research ; the converse may now be pointed out, that much that was 
valueless, dangerous, and even disgusting in medicine in earlier days was 
incorporated into the medical lore of the time, and often remained there for 
generations stealing lives by thousands, because physicians had not yet adopted 
the research method, and so based their practice upon ignorant and unfounded 
convention. It is noticeable in literature that up to somewhere in the beginning 
of the nineteenth century physicians and surgeons were often as a class looked 
upon by scholars and educated people with a certain amount of contempt. 
There were notable and fine exceptions in all ages, but, taken as a whole, the 
profession of medicine was not held in that high esteem and admiration that 
it is amongst all classes to-day. Take for example, Burns's picture of Dr. 
Hornbook or Sterne's account of Dr. Slop in ' Tristram Shandy,' and similar 
examples in plenty are to be found in the Continental literature. The reason 
for the change is to be found in the comparative growth of medical science 
as a result of the research method. The physicians of those days were very 
often ignorant quacks employing the most disgusting and dangerous remedies, 
or methods of treatment, based upon no experimental knowledge and handed 
down in false tradition from ignorant master to ignorant and often almost 
illiterate apprentice. It is only necessary to peruse the volumes written on 
materia medica of this period to shudder at the nature of the remedies ap- 
parently in common use; the details are unfit for modern publication. 

Even in the first half of the nineteenth century patients were extensively bled 
almost to exhaustion in a vast variety of diseases in which we now know with 
certainty that life would be endangered by such treatment and chance of recovery 
diminished. Thus, in a text-book published in 1844 by the Professor of 
Medicine in the most famous University in medicine of our country, and a 
physician in ordinary to her Majesty Queen Victoria, it is said that in the 
treatment of pneumonia ' the utmost confidence may be placed in general Blood- 
letting which should always be large and must almost always be repeated .some- 
times four or six times or even oftener. Blistering and purging, under the

same cautions as in the BronchitiR, are to be employed ; and two other remedies 
have been mnch recommended— Opium, especially (ombined with Calomel, and 
the Solution of Tartar Emetic' It seems scarcely credible to us nowadays that 
;ibout this same period a low diet, blood-letting, emetics, and purgatives were 
employed as a treatment in phthisis, yet such is the case. It is in keeping with 
tlie above, and in strange contrast to modern treatment, to find it recommended 
that if the patient cannot winter abroad he is ordered ' strict confinement within 
doors in an artificial climate, as near as possible to 60° Fahr., during at least 
six months of the year in Britain.' From the text-books of medicine of this 
period, only seventy years back, instances of wrongful and even dangerous 
treatment in most of the important diseases might be produced. There is no 
basis of accurate scientific knowledge of physiology, bio-chemistry, or bacteriology 
underlying the visionary notions about disease. The real causes of the diseases 
being obscure, they are commonly set down to so-called diatheses or habits such 
as the ' hsemorrhagic diathesis' or the ' scrophulous habit.' Also, the action of 
infective organisms and the intimate relationships in regard to infection of 
members of the same family being unknown or forgotten, such ' habits ' are 
erroneously set down as hereditary. When there is no other channel of escape 
the word ' idiopathic' is coined to cover the ignorance of the learned. 

If now we pass onwards about thirty years in time, halving the distance be- 
tween the above period and our own time, and consult an important text-book of 
medicine published in 1876 by a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, a 
physician and lecturer at a famous London Medical School, and a lecturer on 
pathology and physiology, we find that the progress attained by research in 
])hysiology, and physiological chemistry, and a growing belief in the possibility 
of infection in many diseases by the micro-organisms, now demonstrated so clearly 
in certain cases by Pasteur and his followers, have commenced to do their bene- 
ficent work in medical practice. The heroic bleedings and leechings and the 
scarcely less violent druggings with strong drugs have disappeared. The patient 
is less harassed by his doctor, who is more content to assist the natural processes 
of recuperation as his knowledge of applied physiology and hygiene teach him, 
rather than to thwart them and to lessen resistance as his predecessor often dicl 
a generation ago when he knew no physiology and less hygiene. Still, the com- 
parison between the text-book of even forty years ago and one of the present 
day shows a wonderful advance, all flowing from the use of the research method 
in the intervening years, both in knowledge of the origins and in the treatments 
of the diseases. 

Time and space forbid going into details, but the whole of serum-, vaccine-, 
and organotherapy were unknown, with the single exception of vaccination for 
variola. Enteric fever has been separated from typhus, but its etiology is still 
obscure, and, to a large extent as a consequence, the mortality from it is fifteen 
to sixteen per cent., or quadruple present-day figures, and it is one of the 
commonest of diseases. The cause of diphtheria is unknown, although it is 
now recognised as a ' contagious ' disease, and as yet research in bacteriology 
has supplied no cure for it. The unity of the various forms of tuberculosis is 
unsuspected, the infecting organism is unknown, and, as a result, it is not 
even recognised as an infectious disease and heredity figures most strongly in 
a dubious etiology leading up to a vacillating treatment. Pneumonia is not 
recognised as due to a micro-organism, and is described as one of the ' idiopathic ' 
diseases. The cause of syphilis, and its relationship to tahes dorsalis, and 
general paralysis are unknown, and generally it may be said that the causes of 
disease are either entirely unknown or erroneously given in at least three-quarters 
of the very incomplete list of diseases that are classified and described. 

This, after all the centuries, was the doleful position of medical science in 
the year 1876, when suddenly light began to shine upon it, brought not by the 
agency of any member of the medical profession, but by a physiological chemist, 
and he \yas led to his great discovery, not in an attempt to solve some problem 
of practical medicine, but by scientific observations devoted to an apparently 
purely philosophical critical research into the supposed origin of life in "a 
jiavticular way. 

It was the experimental or research method in bio-chemistry supported by 
physiological experiments on animals which in the hands of "Louis Pasteur

hiid tuo luuiidatiuiis of true knowledge, and transformed medicine from what 
has been described above into the glorious, living, evolving science that we 
possess to-day. 

The men who fought side by side with Pasteur in his famous struggle 
against orthodoxy in medicine as represented by the leading physicians and 
surgeons of the period between 1860 and 1880 were mainly chemists, biologists, and 
physiologists, such as Claude Bernard, Paul Bert, J. B. Dumas, Biot, Belard, and 
Sainte-Claire Deville in his own country, and Tyndall and Huxley in ours. A 
few physiciahs and surgeons of scientific training in Franco and England recog- 
nised the importance of his discoveries, such as Alphouse Uuerin, Villemin, and 
Vulpian in his own country, while Lister in ours was already at work, had 
experimented widely and wrote his memorable letter of congratulation to 
Pasteur in 1874, informing him of the work he had been doing in introducing 
antiseptic surgery in England during the preceding nine years. Against this 
intrepid little band of experimental scientists were massed all the batteries of 
orthodox medical nescience served by the distinguished physicians and surgeons 
of the time; but truth is mighty and must prevail. Davaine applying Pasteur's 
jirinciples in a medical direction had found out the bacterial origin of anthrax, 
and although he was violently attacked by oratorical arguments in opposition to 
experimental proofs, and accused, as many physiologists are to-day, of having 
' destroyed very many animals and saved very few human beings,' his facts 
held fast, and combined with the later experiments of Koch and of Pasteur, 
not merely established the etiology of anthrax as we know it to-day but gave a 
support and forward growth to that new-born babe, Bacteriology, which without 
such animal experiments could never have grown into the beneficent giant that 
it is to-day in all its glorious strength for the weal of humanity. 

Pasteur himself meanwhile was hard at work in the small ill-equipped 
laboratory of Physiological Chemistry of the Ecole Normale at Paris, from 
which the fame of his discoveries began rapidly to spread, and shed a new light 
forth on the medical world. Pasteur at this stage had already largely re- 
habilitated the national prosperity of his own country by his successful 
researches on silk-worm disease and on fermentation maladies and the diseases 
of wines. All this effect upon national industries, it is to be noted, followed on 
from an inquiry of apparently no j)ractical importance on spontaneous generation. 
He now turned his genius towards disease, there also utilising the same dis- 
covery arising from a research that contained at first sight no possible appli- 
cations to disease, and the remainder of his life was devoted to the extension 
of these studies. The subsequent history of this discovery is the science of 
Bacteriology with all its ramifications and manifold applications in industry, 
in agriculture, in medicine, and in public health, investigated by the experi- 
mental method by thousands of willing workers all over the civilised world. 
Who but the ignorant Philistine, who knows not what he jjrates about, can 
deny the profound influence of animal experimentation, and the philosophic 
aijplication of the principle of research upon the history of the world ? 

Let us now, from the vantage-point of the present, look back at the past and 
glean from the study of the manner in which this science took origin some 
knowledge to guide us, first, as to how research may be fostered and encouraged 
in the future, and secondly, as to how the results of research may be applied 
for social advantage. 

The first and perhaps the finest thought of all is that research must be 
pursued with the highest ideals of the imaginative mind apart from all desired 
applications or all wished for material advantages. If we might personify 
Nature, it would seem that she does not love that researcher who only seeks 
her cupboard, and never shows her finest treasures to him. She must be loved 
for her own beauty and not for her fortune, or she will ne'er be wooed and won. 
Not even the altruistic appeal of love for suffering mankind would seem to 
reach her ears ; she seems to say : ' Love me, be intimate with me, search me 
out in my secret ways, and in addition to the rapture that will fill your soul at 
some new beauty of mine that you have discovered and known first of all men, 
all these other material things will be added, and then I may take compassion 
on your purblind brothers and allow you to show them these secret charms 
of mine also, so that their eyes may perchance grow strong, and they, too, led 



544 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION I. 

hither by you, may worship at tlie slirinc of my matchless beauty.' By all 
the master discoveries in all the paths of science, Nature is ever teaching us this 
great doctrine to which we liave closed our ears so long. She tells us the 
creation of the world is not finished, the creation of the world is going on, 
and I am calling upon you to take a part in this creation. Never mind that you 
cannot see the whole, love that you see, work at it, and be thankful that I have 
given you a part to play with so much pleasure in it, and so doing you will 
rise to the highest ideal. 

This is religion -with thirst for knowledge as its central spring ; does it differ 
much from those aspirations which have made men of all nations worship 
throughout all the ages ? Anthropology teaches us that the religious system 
of a race of men gives a key to their advancement in civilisation. If this be so, 
growth in natural knowledge must elevate our highest conceptions, furnish purer 
ideals, and give us more of that real religion that is to be found running so 
strongly in the minds of great individuals such as Isaac Newton, Michael 
Faraday, Louis Pasteur, Auguste Comte. A great man may be strongly 
opposed to the orthodox creeds of his day, he may even sneer at them, he 
may be burnt at the stake by their votaries, and yet be a man of strong religious 
feelings and emotions which have furnished the unseen motive power, perhaps 
unsuspected even by himself, that leads tu a whole life of scientific heroism 
and enthusiasm. 

The practical lesson for us to learn from all tliis is that we must consider 
research as sacred and leave it untrammelled by fetters of utilitarianism. The 
researcher in functional biology, for example, must be left free to pursue 
investigations as inspiration leads him on any li\ ing structure from a unicellular 
plant to a man, and must not be expected to devise a cure for tuberculosis or 
cancer. In his research he must think of something higher even than saving 
life or promoting health, or he is likely to prove a failure at the lower level also. 

As an example of the wrong attitude of mind towards science, there may 
be taken the point of view of those utilitarians who complain of the amount 
■ of time and discussion at present being given to the problem of the origin of 
life. These wiseacres with limitations to their brains say ' that is an insoluble 
]irobleni, we shall never get to the bottom of it, let us simply assume, since it is 
here, that life did originate somehow, and, taking this as an axiom, proceed 
to some practical experimental problem ; the origination of life does not lend 
itself to experimental inquiry.' 

Now it is, strange to say, just those problems that appear most insoluble 
upon which the inquiring type of mind loves to linger and spend its energies, 
and, although the problems never may be solved, the misty solitudes to which 
they lead are glorious and the fitful gleams of half-sunshine that come through 
are more kindling to the senses of such men, than the briglitest sunshine on the 
barest of hills. It is here, and in such quests, that the biggest of human 
discoveries are made, and not all of them are in natural science alone. 

The search after the mystery and origin of life had profound influence in 
raising man from a savage to a civilised human being, and is found as an 
integral part in all religions above a certain level of savagery. Much of the 
system of morals and ethics of civilised nations is unconsciously grouped round 
this problem, and we owe the existence of that social conscience which 
makes each of us our race's keeper to our interest in the nature of life, and 
our ties with other lives. Leave such a problem alone and attend to routine 
researches ! Why, the human intellect cannot do it, such problems compel 
attention ! What, it may be asked, was it that started all this routine research 
in biology, in favour of which we are asked to abandon the search after the 
origin of "life? The routine research would not exist, but for a discovery made 
in investigating whether life originated in a certain alleged way. 

If the whole science of bacteriology emerged from a proof that a certain alley 
did not lead to the origin of life, how much more glorious may that knowledge 
become that finally leads us to this goal, or even one step onward in our true 
path towards it. The search after the origin of life is an experimental inquiry, 
it leads straight to research, that is all the physicist or chemist demands of a 
theory, it should be enough for the biologist. We "who search for this are not 
occultists whatever may be said of those who oppose. 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 545 

Let us then leain to have a catholic spirit about research, and try to convince 
the world that it commands devotion not merely because of material advantages 
which it may bring, but because it is the most lovely and most holy thing that 
has been given to man. So may we clear the fair name of Science of the false 
charge of materialism that is so often brought against it by those who do not 
know and judge Science purely by mechanical inventions. 

Next let us consider the applications of scientific discovery and see if we 
cherish aright the gifts of the fairy godmother, for her gifts are dangerous if 
wrongly used. Consider, if this be doubted, the enormous advantages given 
by mechanical and chemical contrivances in producing the material comforts 
necessary to civilised human existence, and then turn your eyes to the reeking 
slums of our great cities. It is clear that natural science cannot go on success- 
fully alone, it must take sociology with it if our world is to be a better world 
to live in because of the gifts brought by scientific discovery. 

Nor is the ideal and the outlook different in the least from that given above 
for pure research, when we come to consider its applications, the same high 
spirit must prevail in all our endeavours, or we shall defeat our own ends and 
miserably fail. Selfishness here, as everywhere, must recoil on the culprit, viho 
only deadens his own soul. Health is needed not to grow wealthy or to prolong 
to greater length a ' lingering death ' as Plato puts it, but to fill life with 
happiness, and beckon the bold and adventurous forward to higher things. 
Here we must copy Nature's own plan and take care of the race as a whole 
instead of spending our energies upon single individuals or favoured classes. 
Nor need anyone fear that any individual or any particular class in the com- 
munity is going to suffer from the adoption of the true scientific attitude towards 
disease. The penalty taken by Nature on the more comfortable classes, who have 
hitherto enjoyed the greater share in government for allowing the existence of 
poverty, disease, and slumdom, is to utilise this neglected area as a culture- 
ground for diseases, which invade the classes above. Nature is still at work 
creating, still conducting evolution at the highest level, and disease is at 
present the tool with which she is working. So long as those poverty-stricken 
slums are allowed to remain, just so long is she grimly prepared to take her 
toll of death and suffering from those who ought to know how to lead on and do 
it not. The disease and the crime below are to the social community what 
pain is to the individual, and just as the special senses become more highly 
organised and sensitive as the nervous system becomes more highly developed, 
so as the civilisation of the community intensifies does the public conscience 
awaken to forms of mischief and crime in one generation that were unsuspected 
in a previous one. So social evils become intolerable and finally are removed. 
How then are we employing our knowledge as to the causation of disease to the 
public problem of its removal or abatement ? 

In regard to the physical environment much has been done during the past 
generation towards applying the laws of hygiene, as is shown in the sanitation 
of our great cities, and especially in regard to the question of water-supply. It 
is good, for example, that Glasgow goes to Loch Katrine for her water-supply, 
Manchester to the English Lakes, and Liverpool to the Welsh hills. Each of 
these great cities carries for many miles the pure distillate of the hills to its 
million of inhabitants. It has cost much in pounds sterling, though not more 
than if each family had a pump in its back-yard. On the other hand, think 
of tlie disease and suffering and death prevented, enteric fever almost gone 
where thousands would have died of it, and tens of thousands been debilitated, 
and these of the best of the citizens, for di.-iease is no eliminator of the unfit. 
Think of all this, and then say. Did it not pay these great cities to bring the pure- 
water from the lakes in the hills ? 

But why do these good cities content themselves to allow their little children 
at a most susceptible age to be supplied still with milk which contains the 
bacillus of tuberculosis in so large a percentage as five to ten per cent. ? And 
why does the law of the land prevent these Corporations from searching out 
tubercular cows in all the areas supplying them with milk ? If it is part of 
the business of a municipality to see that its citizens have a pure water-supply, 
why should it not also be allowed to see that they have a clean milk-supply? 

Long ago the power to make the lame to walk was regarded as a divine gift 

1914. N N 



546 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION I. 

When is mankind going to awake to the fact that Science has placed this gift 
in its hands ? Much more than half of the lame and spinally-def ormed children 
in our midst are in that condition because of infection of joints or spine with 
the bacillus of tuberculosis. By open-air hospitals and open-air schools we seek 
and succeed in curing a percentage of them, but how much better it would be 
if we took the fundamental problem of tubercular infection in hand and 
prevented them from becoming lame and deformed ? 

There is at present on foot in England a great scheme to enable the blind 
to read, and it deserves our support because it is our fault that these people are 
blind. The sad fate of the man born blind appeals to all kind hearts ; but men 
are not born blind, they become blind within a week or two of birth because of 
an infectious disease contracted from the mother at birth. Science knows and 
has taught the world how this blindness can be quite prevented, and it is 
because of our faulty organisation for attending to maternities amongst the 
poor that these people are blind. By proper organisation practically all blind- 
ness arising at the time of birth can be prevented. Why is it not done ? Thus 
our modern Science can make the blind to see and the lame to walk, but it is 
so manacled by ancient ways and customs that it is left powerless, and so there 
are these maimed and darkened lives of innocent people, and they are left 
partially burdening the community which has only its own folly to blame for 
the whole stupid position. 

Let us consider lastly a disease which collects the last toll from one-seventh 
of humanity, and debilitates and enfeebles the lives of many whom it does not 
entii'ely destroy. At all ages, in infancy, in the prime of life, and in life's 
decline, it snatches away the best of our fellow-men. How are we organising 
our campaign against tuberculosis ? Bacteriology has taught us that it is an 
infectious disease and has isolated the organism. It is an undoubted fact, proven 
to the hilt by many inquiries and observations, that infection passes from 
individual to individual. How is this knowledge being applied, and how are 
we attempting to stem the tide of infection? In the United Kingdom alone 
about 70,000 persons die annually of the disease, and all over the civilised world 
the total death-roll of human kind annually from tuberculosis 'probably does 
not fall short of a million souls. This tide of infection is kept up, year in, year 
out, and every 70,000 dying annually in Britain must have infected 70,000 fresh 
victims before they themselves are carried away. Can it not be stopped, this 
foul tide of infection? What is being done to stop it? Sanatoria are being 
provided for the early cases, the bad and most infectious cases are largely being 
left alone to sow infection broadcast and then die. This is the chief means 
being used at present to stop the tide. The early non-infectious case is deemed 
the more important to look after, and the well-advanced, open, thoroughly 
infectious case is left to itself to infect others and then to die. This is the 
condition of our public health attitude in regard to tuberculosis. It is a travesty 
on the application of all biological laws, and in direct opposition to all laws of 
racial preservation. Industrial conditions have produced an artificial environ- 
ment and enhanced the chances of infection by the organism of this disease ; 
it should be our plan to copy Nature's method and safeguard the interests of 
the community, and to do this we must proceed on the plan of separating the 
source of infection — that is to say, the infectious individual from the sound 
individual. This is done with success in the case of small-pox and cholera, 
and this plan has eradicated hydrophobia; why should it not be carried out in 
the case of tuberculosis? Under present conditions men, women, and children 
are going on unwittingly infecting one another by the thousand with tuberculosis 
in school, workshop, and home, and we who know it take no public action and 
raise no clamant outcry against it. It is of more value to the community to 
isolate one pauper far advanced in tuberculosis than to send ten early cases to 
sanatoria. This disease must be stopped at its source as well as dealt with on 
its course. No disease has ever been eradicated from a community by dis- 
covering cures for it, and none ever will ; many diseases have disappeared 
because their sources have been cut off. 

Let us be scientific, let us search out the truth; having found it, let us act 
upon it, and let us conceal nothing that is true.

3. Pseudo-Motor Action and Recurrent Senslhility. 
By Professor W. A. Osborne. 

(1) If the hypoglossal nerve is cut and some days afterwards stimulation 
is applied to the distal end of the freshly cut lingual, a motor response in the 
tongue muscles is obtained. This frequently described pseudo-motor action can 
be readily demonstrated. Attempts have been made in the present research 
to obtain this response in other regions such as the facial muscles innervated by 
branches of V. and VII., but witliout success. Occasionally in man there is a 
moderately thick connecting loop between the lingual and hypoglossal. This 
is described as normal in the anatomy of the horse and dog, but numerous dis- 
sections have failed to give one instance, so that histological examination is 
unfortunately lacking. 

(2) Stimulation of the distal facial nerve may give rise to reflex responses 
including rise of blood-pressure. This effect is obtained only very seldom. 
When given it can be shown to be due to sensory impulses arising in the tense 
fibres of the contracting facial muscles. It vanishes on very light curarisation, 
and cannot, therefore, be due to a definite union between facial and trigeminal 
fibres. 



4. Central Neural Response to Peripheral Neural Distortion. 
By Professor W. A. Osborne a'nd Basil Kilvington, M.S. 

When two nerve-trunks such as the popliteals are crossed the co-ordination 
is rapidly learned after regeneration has set in. We ' have shown that the 
central changes required in the new conducting mechanism are well establi.shed 
even in the lowest levels of the central nervous system. We have also shown 
that if there is considerable axon bifurcation in the peripheral nerve-trunks, and 
if fibres of the same neuron traverse antagonistic routes {e.g., flexor and 
extensor), good co-ordination is not acquired. In our latest experiments the 
central phrenic on one side was sutured to a distal cord of the brachial plexus. 
When regeneration occurred a restricted portion of the scapular muscles was 
seen to be rhythmically excited in synchronism with the diaphragm. The action 
of the contracting fibres on the limb was very slight, producing in the 
anassthetised animal a just detectable abduction. 

In eleven months' time no change could be observed in the amount of move- 
ment of the affected muscular fibres. Support and progression had never been 
interfered with, and presumably for this reason co-ordination was not acquired. 
The operation gave an interesting method for observing inhibition in a restricted 
number of muscular fibres. During expiration the exposed stirface of the 
affected portion of the deltoid was seen to bulge slightly thi'ough pressure of 
adjacent tonic fibres. During asphyxia the visible contracting area enlarged, 
encroaching upon portions of muscle surface not previously affected.

a nervous mechanism controlling venous tension. Secondly, with certain

dilators. Thirdly, with certain exceptions, cardiac and arterial innervations 
appear co-ordinated — the vagi with the dilator, and the accelerators with the 
vaso-constrictor mechanisms. 

Evidence of venous innervation : — 

(1) Venous pressure in asphyxia rises either simultaneously with, or subse- 
quent to, the rise, and after the fall to zero of arterial blood-pressure. 

(2) Venous pressure rises either simultaneously with, independently of, or 
it fails to rise with, the rise of arterial blood-pressure upon the intravenous 
injection of adrenalin, epinine, or pituitary. Moreover, it may rise and fall 
and rise again during the period of raised arterial pressure upon intravenous 
injection mentioned. 

(3) During syncopal fall of arterial blood-pressure the bowel volume markedly 
diminishes. This occurs whether the animal be prore or supine, and whether 
the heart's rate be greatly or slightly retarded. Such fall in arterial blood- 
pressure is accompanied by a rise in venous blood-pressure and arterial vaso- 
dilation, as is well shown in the syncope induced by clamping the brain 
arteries, in which case the heart's rate is practically constant. The only inter- 
pretation which seems possible is that of venous constriction. 

The possibility of interpreting these results as due to varying intra- 
abdominal tension from muscular action, or to alterations in cardiac output, or 
to blood displacements or changes in ai'terial tension, was found to be inade- 
quate to explain the phenomena. Venous innervation seems to be the only 
interpretation possible. 

The frequent association of vagus inhibition of the heart — as represented 
by a retardation of rate ranging from moderate slowing to actual heart-stop — 
with a rise of venous pressure, cannot be ascribed to dislocation of blood as 
a result of diminution in the heart's output, because it occurs whether the 
arterial blood-pressure be falling or rising. Similarly the fall of venous 
pressure constantly associated with accelerator action cannot be ascribed to 
dislocation of blood by arterio-constrictor retention, since it occurs whether 
the arterial blood-pressui'e be low or rising. IMoreover, the venous blood- 
pressure may be found both high and low in a single tracing, in which, through- 
out, the arterial blood-pressure is high, but in which vagal action is temporarily 
replaced by accelerator, during which temporary period the venous pressure 
falls and remains low "till vagal action is restored. It points to co-ordinate 
innervation, and further to reciprocal relations between the vagi and venons 
dilators on the one hand, and the accelerators and venous con.strictors on the 
other. 

Examination of a larger number of blood-pressure tracings .shows a constancy 
of co-ordinate innervation of the cardiac accelerator with vasoconstrictor, and 
again of the cardiac vagus with vasodilator mechanisms. They furthermore 
indicate a reciprocal relation between these groups. There are accountable 
exceptions in asphyxia, adrenalin and other intoxications, depressor nerve 
excitation, a depression of the vagi, &amp;c. Syncopal fall of arterial blood-pressure 
with cardiac slowing is constantly associated with vaso-dilation, whilst sudden 
rises in arterial blood-pressure show more or less the incidence of accelerator 
rhythm, which may or may not be due to increased secretion of the suprarenals. 

6. Artificial Collateralisatinn as applied lo the Abdominal Aorta. 
By Basil Kilvington, M.S. 

Cases have been found post-mortem where the abdominal aorta has been 
completely occluded, yet life has been possible. This has been caused by certain 
pathological conditions which act gradually. 

An attempt was made to imitate this gradual occlusion by ligaturing the 
abdominal aorta in two st-ages. The first operation consisted in partly obstruct- 
ing the aorta by a silk ligature applied a short distance above the bifurcation 
into the two iliac vessels. It was impossible to gauge accurately the narrow- 
ing, but, as a rough test, the ligature on the aorta was tightened till the 
pulsation was just, though definitely, perceptible to the finger applied where 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION I. 549 

the common femoral crosses the ramus of the pubes. The animal recovered 
from this with few symptoms, and two or three weeks later the aorta was 
completely blocked by a second ligature applied just central to the first. In 
every instance the animal survived this, and after recovering from the operation 
ran about as usual. 

In the deep epigastric the flow was reversed, i.e., the blood moved from 
the umbilicus through the superior epigastric downwards. The main collateral 
supply came, however, from the anastomoses between the two circumflex 
vessels (branches of the femorals) with the sciatic and lumbar arteries about 
the upper end of the thigh. Blood-pressure tracings from the femoral artery 
displayed typical damped oscillations similar to those obtained from a normal 
artery when the connecting tube to the manometer is partly clamped. Obstruc- 
tion of the aorta above the iliacs, produced immediately by a single ligature, 
is practically always fatal. 

It is intended to utilise this method in ligature of vessels which is attended 
by grave complications owing to poor collateral blood-supply. An ideal instance 
would be in the case of the abdominal aorta for an aneurism situated below the 
renal vessels. Other less critical examples would be in the case of the common 
femoral or popliteal arteries. This method might prove more suitable than 
plastic ojieration ou the aneurism itself.

TUESDAY, AUGUST 18. 

Discussion on Ancesthetics. 



(i) Opening Remarks. By Professor A. D. Waller, F.R.S. 

Professor Waller, after a complimentary reference to the epoch-making 
work on chloroform anaesthesia by Professor Martin and Dr. Embley in Mel- 
bourne, discussed some of the outstanding features in connection with the 
dangers of the administration of chloroform. He emphasised the rule that the 
amount of chloroform administered must not be above 2 per cent, nor below 
1 per cent, to be effective. Any apparatus used must be contrived with the above 
object in view. 



550 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION 1. 

Professor Waller considered that the fear of chloroform is excessive at the 
present day, but that the danger is very small if not more than 2 per cent. 
is administered. Idiosyncrasy is of some importance, but most cases of acci- 
dents arise from the giving of too much chloroform, and not from the use of 
too little. He demonstrated a portable chloroform apparatus which admirably 
fuliils the conditions desired. 

(ii) Remarks by Dr. E. H. Embley. 

The employment of the regulating inhaler is certainly a progressive step in 
the administration of chloroform. Anaesthesia so induced is not attended by the 
great nervous excitation which so frequently accompanies the administration of 
chloroform by the droj) method. This with the attendant exaggeration of 
respiratory intake, so raising the tension of the chloroform in the arterial blood 
for the time, constitutes an important contributing factor to the causation of 
primary syncope. Moreover, the uniformity of the resulting anaesthesia by 
the regulating inhaler is quite remarkable. It is free from the oscillations in 
depth of narcosis so often observed in the drop method. 

Yet it has not been adopted in Melbourne. Tliis appears to be due to the 
frequent necessity of transgressing the 2 per cent, boundary line of safety and 
of employing 2'5 or 3 per cent, concentration to induce anaesthesia in reasonable 
time; also because in the light degree of narcosis maintained, depressor reflexes 
appear to occur much more readily than in the deeper narcosis of the older 
method ; but more especially has it been abandoned on the grounds of the 
toxicity of chloroform, however administered. Professor Waller has stated 
that the relative pharmacological potency of chloroform and ether is as 10 to 1. 
(I have found that 22 per cent, chloroform vapour is nine times as depressing 
to the myocardium as is 191 per cent, ether, and 40 times as depressing as is 
10 per cent, ether.) This is the relative toxicity, and the actual reason for the 
abandonment of chloroform. More esjaecially is this the case since the adoption 
of the method of mixed ether narcosis, that is, the preliminary use of morphine 
and other alkaloids. One practically never hears of reflex, or the other form 
of syncope, in mixed ether narcosis. 

I cannot recall statistics of mortality from chloroform syncope, but I think 
Leonard Hill found, some years ago, that it represented about 90 per cent, of 
the total mortality. I have several experimental records of this form of death 
from chloroform. I find the mechanism of chloroform syncope to be the com- 
bined exaltation of the cardio-inhibitory and arterio-dilator nervous mechanisms 
— the heart is arrested and the arteries dilated. Whether the heart will free 
itself from the inhibition depends upon the degree of responsivity remaining in 
the heart when the inhibition occurred; also probably upon the extent of the 
compensatory rise of venous blood-pressure. If the vagus terminals give out 
early the heart frees itself. Venous pressure always rises in syncope. In 
chloroform syncope the rise is proportional to the degree of general intoxication. 
A high venous pressure in the cavities of the right side of the heart and in the 
great veins adjacent seems to exert a stimulus towards the restoration of the 
heart's rhythm. Artificial respiration appears to exert a similar stimulus, it 
also exerts a stimulus towards re-starting the respiratory rhythm. The rise of 
venous pressure in the right heart cavities may be augmented by gravity — that 
is, by turning the patient so that the head is on the floor and the feet up, and 
by aspirating the splanchnic bed in doing artificial respiration. 

Deaths from excessive intoxication by chloroform, apart from cardiac inhibi- 
tion — that is, deaths from general paralysis of the cardio-vascular musculature 
and depression of the nervous mechanism of the circulation — must be very rare. 
Such cases are thought to occur during the course of anesthesia — that is, after 
the more dangerous period of induction. In most instances the respiration fails 
first, and then any further accession to the tension of chloroform in the blood is 
arrested. Artificial respiration then suffices to restore the blood-pressure. When 
such deaths do appear to occur the final stroke is probably always cardiac 
inhibition. The excitability of the vagi, Avhich had become depressed by the 
chloroform after the initial period of excitation, is again exalted by the bulbar 
anaemia consequent upon the low blood-pressure. It is extremely difficult to 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION I. 551 

kill an animal with chloroform after the vagi are cut. The protective use of 
atropine with the same object as vagotomy is sound in principle, but it has 
not been availed of by anaesthetists chiefly on account of its disturbing effect 
on the pupil of the eye, thereby misleading them as to the depth of narcosis. 

(iii) Resuscitation in Threatened Fatalities during the Administration 
of General AncBsthetic Agents. By E. H. Embley, M.D. 

Deaths under anaesthetics by no means occur from a common cause nor 
under the same pathological conditions. They may be arranged in four 
groups : — I. Syncopal. II. From excessive tension of an.ijsthetic in the body. 
III. Shock or exhaustion. IV. Pre-existing pathological states and various 
accidental conditions. 

I. Syncopal. — ^Sucli cases occur early in the administration. Respiration 
ceases either just before, at the same time as. or just after the heart — mainly 
in conse-quence of the low or absent arterial blood-pressure. The cessation of 
pulse and the loss of colour from the face are sudden. The heart is arrested 
and the arterioles relaxed by inhibition, not by paralysis. The venous blood- 
pressure is high. Reflex syncope may happen at a later period in the administra- 
tion, but it occurs mostly under light narcosis. 

II. Excessive narcosis. — Respiration invariably ceases before the circulation. 
The loss of colour of face and the progressive diminution in pulse volume and 
ten.sion are relatively much slower than in syncope. In chloroform narcosis the 
respiration has been progressively diminishing up to the time of stoppage. The 
cardio-vascular neuro-muscular mechanism is paralysed, and both the venous 
and the arterial blood-pressures are low. 

III. Shock or exhaustion, whether previously existing or incurred in the 
operation, is indicated by a progressively increasing heart-rate (generally except- 
ing that of old people), with diminution in pulse tension and volume. Loss of 
face-colour and diminishing efficiency of lung-ventilation progress similai-ly. 
The vaso-motor system is chiefly concerned in the circulatory failure. The 
experimental evidence available up to the present indicates exhaustion of the 
vaso-motor central mechanism, and of the secretory function of the adreiials, as 
the causative factors of the circulatory depression in shock. The venous and 
arterial blood-pressures being low, the heart cavities are imperfectly filled and 
the coronary blood-supply inadequate for the heart'.-? needs. Respiration is 
defective and the temperature low. 

IV. Dro-^vning by blood, pathological fluids, vomit, &amp;c. Laryngeal obstruc- 
tion by spasm, foreign bodies, vomit or blood. Respiratory paralysis in cases 
of cerebral pressure. CEdema of the glottis. Retropharyngeal absce.ss. Ludwig's 
angina. -Septic degenerations. Reflex syncope from surgical afferents, &amp;c. 

I. Syncope. — The aim in treatment is that of cutting short the inhibition. 
Three methods arc of value for this purpose : — (a) Raising the blood-pressure 
in the right cavities of the lieart and in the great veins adjacent, {h) Artificial 
respiration, (c) Rhythmic manual compression of the heart. 

(*■') Raising the venous blood-pressure in the hea.rt and adjacent veins. Some 
evidence seems to indicate that heightening venous tension in these parts is the 
cause of the normal cardiac rhythm. This pressure is high in syncope, but in 
the syncope of anaesthetics the rise of pressure is more or less impaired. It 
may, however, be supplemented by gravity when the patient is inverted head 
down, and by the aspirating effect of artificial respiration. A good head of 
pressure, at the right side of the heart, furthermore affords the requisite blood 
for filling the arterial system when inhibition ceases. 

{!&gt;) Although artificial respiration cannot oxygenate the blood with the circu- 
lation arrested, it exercises the afferent impulses whereby reflexly the respiratory 
rhythm is regulated by alternately inflating and compressing the pulmonary 
alveoli, and it assists in helping to restart the heart by the precordial pressure 
of the expiration movements, besides assisting to raise the venous pressure in 
the great veins adjacent to the right heart. 

('■) Rhythmic manual compression of the heart through the diaphragm.^ 
When the above measures fail this should not be neglected, thougli it entails 
opening the abdomen. Experimentally it invariably succeeded in restarting a 



552 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION I. 

heart arrested by inhibition, but it ahvays failed in cases where the heart was 
irresponsive to stimuli, from excessive narcosis. In such cases as these, and 
in those in which the heart was pathologically impaired beforehand, was syncope 
fatal. 

The use of strychnine, atropine, ether, amj-l nitrite, &amp;c., is irrational. 

II. Excessive narcosis. — When the heart has ceased from this cause no 
remedy will "restart it. Experimentally the tension of the anresthetic in the 
myocardium may be rapidly reduced, so as to admit of restoration of function, 
by the perfusion of isotonic salt solution through the coronary arteries ; but 
this has no clinical value in consequence of the pulmonary oedema which ensues 
and the difficult surgical technique entailed. The indications for treatment 
are : — (1) Elimination of the anaesthetic as rapidly as possible. (2) Raising the 
blood-pressure in the right cavities of the heart and in the adjacent veins. 

(1) Elimination. — In less severe intoxication, with respiration still continuing, 
it is only necessary to withdraw the anaesthetic mask. Where respiration is 
feeble or has ceased, artificial respiration is demanded. This not only eliminates 
the anfesthetic, but it oxygenates the blood and assists in raising the venous 
blood-pressure in the great veins at the rig'ht side of the heart. 

(2) Raising the venous pressure at the heart. — Inversion into the head-down 
position and artificial respiration, as for syncope. If the heart has not ceased, 
recovery is relatively rapid. Strychnine is not harmful, but it is not indicated. 
Amyl nitrite and ether are both harmful. Fatal excessive narcosis is often 
finally accompanied by cardiac inhibition. 

III. Shock. — The same indications exist for raising the blood-pressure in 
the right cavities of the heart and the veins adjacent as for I. and II. This 
is attained by inversion into the head-down position. The body-heat must be 
maintained and warm oxygen inhalations used. The employment of warm 
saline injections or infusions is not indicated unless in collapse from great loss 
nf blood. Otherwise the rise of arterial and venous blood-pressure is soon lost 
in consequence of its rapid exudation into the surrounding tissues. Ergot and 
pituitary are of use in the mild forms, but where help is urgent they fail. 
Adrenalin and epinine, however, alvvay.^ raise both venous and arterial blood- 
pressure, but only temporarily unless it be given by continuous flow into the 
vein and not of greater concentration than one in 500,000, with the pulse used 
as a guide. The flow should be reduced if the pulse-rate falls to 60 per 
minute. The more severe the shock the greater is the care necessary to guard 
against vagus inhibition of the lieart or against ventricular fibrillation from 
excess of adrenalin. 

IV. — In cases of drowning the patient should be inverted head-down, and, 
if the fluids have entered the bronchus from below, the sound side should be 
preserved from flooding by promptly turning it uppermost. When both sides 
are flooded a tube should be inserted through a laryngotomy opening and the 
blood or fluid aspirated by the mouth or other ready means. Laryngeal spasm 
or obstruction may be relieved by the finger or sponge cleaning out the glottis. 
An artificial cough, induced by sudden bilateral compression of the thorax, 
will often expel material or open a larynx closed by spasm. Respiratory failure 
in operations in cases of cerebral compression may be obviated by a preliminary 
injection of atropine, otherwise artificial respiration must be performed through 
the operation. Light narcosis is used throughout these operations. Cases of 
cedema of the glottis, retropharyngeal abscess, and Ludwig's angina are very 
dangerous for general anxsthesia, and .should be operated under local anaesthesia 
only. Reflex syncope cases are treated as syncope. Cases known to be liable 
to depressor reflexes should receive a preliminary injection of morphine and 
atropine, and be given ether 

(iv) Observations on a Case of Delayed Chloroform Poisoning . 
By Professor E. F. C. Leitii. 

Tliis form of poisoning denotes a persistent and generally fatal intoxication 
which comes on at varying intervals (from a few hours to many days) after the 
chloroform narcosis has passed off, and closely resembles the pyogenic forms. 
It is a rare condition, the number of cases recorded since its first recognition 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION I. 553 

by Caspar in 1S50 hardly exceeding fifty. The present case occurred in the 
General Hospital, Birmingham, in October 1913, in a boy aged eight, admitted 
under the care of Mr. Woodman. He was a healthy lad who had been run over 
by a light motor van. Laparotomy disclosed a rupture of the liver about two 
inches long and one and a half inch deep close to the fissure of the gall bladder. 
The abdominal cavity contained about two pints of blood-stained tiuid. There 
was no other lesion. Neither the shock nor the amount of blood lost was serious. 
The operation lasted half an hour, ana-sthesia having been initiated by chloroform 
and ether mixture for four minutes, and maintained thereafter by ether alone. 
The total amount of chloroform administered did not exceed two drachms. He 
recovered completely from the narcosis and did well for a time, but symptoms 
suggestive of .septic poisoning supervened, and he died in about forty hours. 
On post-mortem e.xamination no peritonitis or other inflammatory condition was 
found, nothing, in short, beyond the rupture and a markedly fatty state of 
the liver, to which the fatal toxsemia could be ascribed. Microscopically an 
intense degree of fatty degeneration combined with a peripheral fatty infiltration 
existed in every lobule throughout the organ, but somewhat more severe in the 
neighbourhood of the rupture. Though there was no actual cell necrosis, the 
nuclei mostly staining well, the cytoplasm was markedly degenerated and had 
lost its power of retaining fat within its intimate structure. Its ' masked ' fat 
had become visible in the form of numerous fine granules and globules within 
the hepatic cells, particularly those in the inner parts of the lobules — a condition 
of true fatty degeneration. Towards the peripheral parts, on the other hand, 
the fat globules were fewer and larger — an infiltration instead of a degeneration. 
The peripheral cells had retained their normal function of infiltrating fat, and a 
larger supply being available, had produced a high degree of fatty infiltration. 
All the. fat present readily absorbed the ordinary stains for fat, and, by giving 
the typical red-colour with Nile blue, was shown to be neutral fat. In short, 
the condition of the liver, while resembling phosphorus poisoning most closely, 
presented appearances similar to those resulting from the action of other 
poisons, notably those of the pyogenic organisms and of acute yellow atrophy. 
All these poisons damage the liver cells, producing granular and fatty degenera- 
tion often combined with fatty infiltration, if their intensity be not too great. 
But they all differ from delayed chloroform in that their results are certain, 
provided that the dose be sufficient, whereas in the case of chloroform the 
results are extremely capricious, hardly arising even in one case for every 
thousand in which they do not appear. That is, if the chloroform be inhaled, 
but if given by the mouth or subcutaneously, they follow as certainly as after 
the other poisons. This anomaly is not at present capable of explanation, 
except on the assumption of an individual idiosyncrasy, and, though individual 
susceptibility to certain drugs is an admitted phenomenon, it can hardly be 
regarded as satisfactory. A better explanation may be forthcoming with an 
increase in our knowledge of the physiological action of chloroform. The severe 
and persistent vomiting which is such a characteristic symptom of the disease, 
and the hiemorrhagic inflammation of the gastric mucosa sometimes found, sug- 
gest that either chloroform or a toxic derivative thereof is secreted into the 
.stomach and absorbed by the portal vein, but, even if true, it does not explain 
the capricious incidence of the disease. In a considerable number of the recorded 
cases, the liver has already been damaged by pre-existing abdominal or other 
disease, and the chloroform may be held to act as the last straw, but in others, 
as in the present case, it has been healthy. But it is not difficult, as experi- 
ments show, to produce, and that rapidly, an extreme degree of fatty change 
within the liver under a variety of conclitions, and it is possible that some 
other factor than the chloroform, not yet recognised, may be the cause of the 
disease. On experimental grounds alone it seems certain that ether cannot cause 
it. Though as yet unexplained, it seems probable that delayed chloroform 
poisoning does exist as a separate entity, and, though rare and fatal in its 
severer forms, may be not uncommon and transient in milder forms. 

Professors Osborne and Milrot also took part in the Discussion.

By Dr. S. Sewell. 

A number of cases of lesions of the spinal cord above the lumbar enlarge-

illustrating the various effects upon the control of the function of micturition 
produced by lesions at these various levels. In lesions of the sacral cord, 
or cauda equina, reflex micturition is not established even after fifteen years, 
patients still maintaining absolute retention and requiring regular catheterisa- 
tion, possibly as a result of the still active lumbar innervation of the sphincter. 
Cases of supra-sacral lesion develop reflex incontinence of urine of which they 
are unconscious, thus suggesting that the spinal arc is sufficiently well laid 
down in human beings for the maintenance of this primitive function. 



3. The Biochemical Significance of Phospliorvs. 
By Miss Hilda Kixcaid, D.Sc. 

The research can be divided into two parts : — • 

I. The general zoological significance of phosphorus. 
II. Its peculiar biochemical significance in Victoria. 

I. The fact that tlie framework of the lower animals is largely CaCO, 
and that of the higher animals Ca^fPO^), suggested that there might be a very 
gradually increasing use of Ca3(P0.,)2 for framework purposes as we ascend 
the animal kingdom. Analysis of the cxoskoleton of each class of invertebrates 
showed the very interesting fact that the phosphorus content increases steadily 
as we ascend the evolutionary scale, though never at any time large in the 
Invertebrata. 

When we come to the endoskeleton of the vertebrates, however, there is a 
.&lt;;udden jump in phosphorus content, which remains practically constant throTigh- 
out the vertebrate group. 

On the other hand, analyses showed that the phosphorus content of nerve 
tissue and muscle has a surprising uniformity throughout the whole animal 
kingdom. 

II. It has been realised for some time that Australian soils are lamentably 
poor in phosphorus, some even as low as 47 parts of phosphoric acid in 
100,000 jiarts of soil. Experiments were made with a view to determining 
whether the deficiency in phosphorus is also a feature of the products of the 
soil, viz., cereals, fodders, woods, &amp;c. 

Analyses showed that Australian native grasses have a markedly lower 
phosphorus content than European; that acclimatised European grasses have a 
higher phosphorus content than native Australian, but lower than the same 
kinds of grasses grown in Europe ; that the wood of the Australian trees has a 
lower phosphorus content than that of European trees, and also that the 
phosphorus content of Victorian wheat-flour is low. 

Lastly, it was urged that as the yearly loss of phosphorus from Victorian 
grazing lands by export of their products is considerable, it is a matter of 
economic importance that such phosphorus should be restored. 



4. An E.rperimental hu-estigaiion on Concussion of tlie Spinal Cord 
and Allied Conditions. By Alan Newton, M.S. 

In this investigation an attempt has been made to determine the effect upon 
the spinal cord of varying degrees of concussion and compression. 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION I. 555 

Methods. — The animals employed were dogs, cats, and monkeys. The 
momentum of a glass rod 8 mm. in diameter weighing 50 grammes falling upon 
tlie exposed cord, or upoil the superficial surface of the laminae of the upper 
lumbar vertebrae, caused the concussion. Motor and sensory conduction in the 
cord was tested at varying intervals after the production of the concussion. 
It wa,s found that very slight injuries of the exposed cord produced marked 
alteration in the conduction, although the anatomical changes demonstrable in 
the cord after such injuries were very slight. Alteration of conduction in the 
spinal cord can be produced by a concussing force directed upon the superficial 
surface of the spinal column, although no macroscopic change in vertebral 
structure is produced. After the abolition of motor efferent conduction afferent 
conduction can still be demonstrated.

1. Climate jruiii the Physiological Point of View. 
By Professor W. A. Osborne. 

The tlieory of wet-bulb temperatures in their relation to body temperature we 
owe to Haldaue. Harrington had already surmised their importance, and had 
mapped the United States with wet-bulb isotherms for the month of July. In 
estimating climatic conditions in Australia, in so far as they affect the body, 
the wet-bulb isotherms are extremely useful. There are, however, certain 
limitations in the use of this method. I have found that the wet bulb is not 
nearly so responsive to change in wind velocity as the human body. A typical 
instance of this is seen when a hot dry north wind in Victoria gives place to a 
cool southerly breeze with or without electrical disturbance and rain. The 
wind drops, the sky becomes overcast, and a feeling of oppression is experienced, 
whilst visible sweating may be more readily provoked. Owing to the over- 
clouding the shade dry-bulb temperature has fallen, and in nearly every 
instance the wet bulb has fallen too. If, however, a wet-bulb thermometer 
is employed, the bulb of which is surrounded by a cage covered with some 
closely woven fabric, it is found to be much more sensitive to wind velocity 
than the naked wet-bulb thermometer. Such a thermometer, too, shows in a 
' change' an increase in the height of the mercury column during the oppressive 
period before the cool breeze. These ' jacketed ' wet-bulb thermometers I have 
made with a cylindrical cage of copper-gauze covered with fine-mesh bolting- 
cloth. Unfortunately the cloth soon becomes greased and clogged. Two or 
three ply of fine copper-gauze will act fairly well instead of the bolting-cloth, 
but here, too, the apertures become filled and readings lack constancy. I have 
been compelled to fall back on quite impervious material in the form of a hollow 
cylinder, open below, but having a perforated stopper of cork above, through 
which the thermometer stem passes. The bulb with its usual cotton covering is 
placed in the centre of the cylinder. In this instrument a considerable degree of 
sensitiveness to change of air velocity can be demonstrated. It will frequently 
show a rise at the onset of a thunderstorm when the ordinary wet bulb gives a, 
fall.

fuge. By H. S. Halcro Wardlaw. 

W'hen milk is spun in a centrifuge a white deposit accumulates in the con- 
taining vessels. The first portion of this deposit consists of cellular material, 
the remainder is composed of minute granules, less than O'OO] mm. in diameter. 
The removal of this material from milk does not raise its freezing-point. The 
composition of this deposit is not constant, but the figures given below show its 
nature : — 

100 parts of dry deposit contain — 

Ash 8 parts 

(P^O"' 3-6) 

(CaO 3-7) 

Combustible Substance 92 „ 

(Caseinogen 57) 

(Lactose 19) 

(Remainder 16) 

The sixteen parts of combustible substance not accounted for contain 2' 5 parts of 
nitrogen, and consist, in part at any rate, of protein coagulated by boiling. 

A considerable portion of the deposit (up to 60 per cent.) is soluble in a 
volume of water equal to that of the milk from which it was removed, and the 
soluble portion contains the bulk of the ash (up to 90 per cent.). 

The percentages of ash in the deposits obtained from the san"i2 sample of milk 
after various periods of spinning are not the same, but first increase and then 
decrease as the spinning is continued. With an initial percentage of ash of 
7-0 the maximum percentage was reached after about two hours' spinning and 
amounted to 8-0. 

The rate of accumulation of this deposit also varies with the time of spinning, 
but approximately inversely to the percentage of ash, first decreasing to a 
minimum, then increasing. The average rate of deposition under the conditions 
of the experiments was about 70 mg. per hour per 100 c.c. of milk. This subse- 
quent increase in the rate of deposition is peculiar.

The following Papers were read : — 

1. Changes in the Reaction of Milk under Different Conditions. 
By Professor T. H. Mileoy, M.D. 

The reaction of the milk was determined by estimating the hydrogen-ion 
concentration by the electrometric method. When hydrogen is passed through 
fresh milk the H concentration is lowered by a removal of carbonic acid. This 
may be avoided either by passing the milk into an electrode already charged with 
hydrogen and then shaking the milk in the vessel until it is saturated with the 
gas, or better by passing the hydrogen through a series of tubes containing milk 
before passing into the electrode containing the same milk. When this is done 
the H concentration of fresh milk is found to vary from about 1-58x10"' N 
normal to 2-24 x 1C~"' N. Greater acidities than the latter are due to commencing 
acid fermentation of the milk. When milk is heated for about an hour at a 
temperature a little below boiling-point, evaporation being prevented, the milk 
when cooled t« room temperature shows a slightly higher H concentration than 
the same milk examined fresh. There is also a greater constancy in the concen- 
tration when one compares a large number of specimens. Such heated milk does 
not undergo coagulation with rennin unless its acidity is raised by the addition 
of weak acid or by the addition of calcium chloride. The addition of calcium 
chloride raises the H concentration and produces coagulability of the milk more 
readily, that is at a lower H concentration, than when weak acids have been 
added. When potassium oxalate is added to milk, in just sufficient quantity to 
prevent coagulation, the H concentration is lowered below the level of that 
observed in ordinary coagulable milk. If one now estimates the H concen- 
tration after the addition of just sufficient CaCU to produce clotting, it is found 
to be within the H concentration limits of ordinary coagulable milk. The 
addition of oxalic acid to oxalate milk doe.s not produce true coagulation. 



2. yari(itio}is in the Hijdroqen-Jon Concentrations of the Blood. 
By Professor T. PT. Mtlroy, .i\/.D. 

The concentration of the hydrogen-ions in the blood can be most satisfactorily 
determined by the electrometric method. There are certain difficulties entailed 
in the method as employed for blood, owing to the fact that the blood is rich in 
oxygen and in carbonic acid. The former gas leads to a depolarisation of the 
hydrogen plate, and so the estimation can only be made after complete reduction 
of the blood, while the latter gas must be prevented from leaving the blood, as 
the variations in the hydrogen-ion concentration are mainly due to changes in 
the carbonic acid content of the blood. 

When the necessary precautions are taken to avoid these fallacies the method 
is sufficiently accurate to enable one to determine the variations due to altera- 
tions in respiration if these alterations be of a sufficiently marked character. 

It may readily be shown that the concentration falls after a period of pro- 
longed pulmonary ventilation and rises again during the period of apnoea. If 
the period of ventilation with air be succeeded by a short period with 10 per 
cent, carbonic acid in air, then the usual fall in concentration does not occur, 
and so there is no resultant apnoea. 

The fall that is produced after ventilation with rich oxygen-holding mixtures 
is of the same degree as that observed after inflation with air. To show the 
degree of the changes in H concentration an example may be given. 

Before ventilation the hydrogen-ion concentration of the blood was 
•3715 X 10-' N, while after fifteen minutes' ventilation with air, followed by two 
minutes and fifteen seconds with oxygen, the concentration was '1995 x 10-" N. 
An apnoeic pause of three minutes ten seconds' duration followed the ventilation 
period, and at the close of this the concentration had risen to '3548 x 10~' N. 
Ten minutes later when breathing was again of normal character the concen- 
tration had risen to -3890 x 10-' N. 

In certain rare cases ventilation does not produce the usual fall, and when 



558 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION I. 

this is the case no apnocic pause is to be observed. The probable reason for this 
departure from the normal is that, although the ventilation has produced a 
removal of carbonic acid from the blood, the fall in hydrogen-ion concentration 
is prevented by a formation of acid products of incomplete combustion.

Corpuscles of some Bloods. By Professor D. A. Welsh, M.D., 
and Dr. H. G. Chapman. 



4. A Comparison of the Activity of Extracts of the Pars Intermedia 
and Pars Nei'vosa of the Ox Pituitary. By Professor P. T. 
Herbing, M.D., F.E.C.P.E. 

It is possible to remove from the posterior lobe of the fresh ox pituitary with 
the aid of a fine pair of curved scissors small quantities of the epithelium of the pars 
intermedia. The material thus obtained from a number of pituitaries was dried, 
powdered in a mortar, and made up by boiling in Ringer's solution into extracts of 
definite percentages of the dried epithelium. Pars nervosa was similarly isolated 
and prepared. 

The extracts were tested upon the virgin rat's uterus, the method employed being 
a modification of Kehrer's and Dale's procedures. The extracts were also tested 
upon the mammary secretion of lactating rats, and upon the blood-pressure, kidney 
volume, and secretion of urine in cats. 

The extracts of both jjors intermedia and pars nervosa exercise a powerful stimu- 
lating effect upon the uterus and the secretion of milk, but the pars nervosa gives 
tlie stronger action in each case. By a comparison of the action of different strengths 
of extracts it is found that the pars nervosa is from two to five times as powerful in its 
effects as pars intermedia. Very minute doses are active : immersion of the uterus 
for 1.5 sec. in "0005 per cent, of the dried jjars nervosa results in a well-marked con- 
traction. The skate pituitary, in which there is no pars nervosa, also jnelds a material 
which acts on the uterus and mammary secretion in a similar manner. The pure 
pars glandularis of the anterior lobe of the ox pituitary has no such action. It is 
probable, therefore, that the active material has its origin in the epithelial cells of 
the qmrs intermedia. Many of these cells invade the pars nervosa, undergoing an 
alteration there into hyaline bodies, which are very numerous in the pars nervosa 
of the ox pituitary. 

Extracts of the qmrs intermedia show no specific action upon the blood-pressure, 
kidney volume, and urinary secretion of cats, even in doses of a '5 per cent, extract 
of the dried epithelium. Extracts of skate's pituitary are similarly inactive. Ex- 
tracts of the pars nervosa, on the other hand give marked effects even in very minute 
doses. The injection into the jugular vein of 2 c.c. of a '01 per cent, extract of dried 
pnrs nervosa gives a typical prolonged rise of blood -pressure, great dilatation of the 
kidney, and increase of the secretion of urine. A similar dose of a "001 per 'cent; 
extract shows a slight action of the same nature. 

The evidence points to there being at least two .separate active principles in the ' 
posterior lobe of the pituitary body. The one, derived from the pars intermedia, 
acts iipon the uterus and mammary gland, the other, found only in the pars nervosa, 
brings about the rise of blood-pressure, and acts specifically upon the k'dney dilating 
its blood-vessels, and causing increased secretion of urine. 

The principle which acts specifically on the kidney may be derived from the 
ependyma cells of the pars nervosa, but this is unlikely. Extracts of no other part 
of the central nervous system, e.g., the filnm terminale of the spinal cord, have any 
such action. It is more likely that the material is derived in some manner from a 
further breaking down of the hyaline bodies, and has, therefore, its ultimate source 
also from the epithelial cells of the pars intermedia. 

The expenses of this research have been borne by a grant from the Carnegie Trust.

G. On Ihti Freezliuj-point of the Laked Red Blood Corpuscles of Man 
and so))ie Domesticated Animals. By Dr. H. G. Chapman. 

If a mixture of blood and 0-9 per cent. NaCl be subjected to immediate 
microscopical examination the red corpuscles are seen to be crenated. When 
less concentrated solutions of salt are used, crenated corpuscles are numerous 
until the concentration of salt falls below 0-55 per cent. Laking of the 
corpuscles commences when the concentration of the salt falls below 0-65 per 
cent. 

Measurements of the freezing-point of laked solutions of the red corpuscles, 
separated in the centrifuge, have been made by Beckmann's apparatus. These 
freezing-points have been invariably higher than those of the serum of the same 
sample of blood. When the corpuscles have been washed with salt solutions 
of different concentrations, the freezing-points of the solutions of the laked 
corpuscles have risen after each washing. After three washings with an equal 
amount of salt solution, the freezing-points of the solutions of the washed 
corpuscles have risen about 0-2° C. When, however, the red corpuscles arc 
washed -with salt solution saturated with tri-basic calcium phosphate, the 
freezing-points of the solutions of red corpuscles remain constant after each 
washing. 

The concentration of the contents of the corpuscles is diminislied by washing 
with salt solution, but not by washing with salt solution saturated with calcium 
phosphate.

Section K.— BOTANY. 
Pkesident op the Section. — Professoi- F. 0. Bower, D.Sc, F.E.S. 



The President delivered the following Address at Sydney, on Friday, 
August 21 :— 

To preside over the Botanical Section on the occasion of its first Meeting in 
Australia is no slight honour, though it also imposes no small responsibility. 
We Members from Great Britain have a deep sense of the advantage which we 
derive from visithig these distant shores. I am doubtful whether any scientific 
profit we can confer by our coming here can balance that which we receive : while 
over and above this is the personal kindliness of the Australian welcome, which 
on behalf of the visitors of this Section from the Old Country I take this oppor- 
tunity of gratefully acknowledging. Of the Members of the British Association, 
those who pursue the Natural Sciences may expect to gain most by their experi- 
ences here; and perhaps it is the Botanists who stand to come off best of all. 
Living as most of us do in a country of old cultivation, the vegetation of which 
has been controlled, transformed, and from the natural floristic point of view 
almost ruined by the hand of man, it is with delight and expectation that we 
visit a land not yet spoilt. To those who study Ecology, that branch of the 
.science which regards vegetation collectively as the luitural resultant of its 
external circumstances, the antithesis will come home with special strength, and 
the opportunity now before them of seeing Nature in her pristine state will not, 
I am sure, be thrown away. 

I may be allowed here to express to the Australian Members of the Section 
my regret that the Presidency for this occasion should not have fallen to one who 
could with unusual weight and knowledge have addressed them from the 
floristic and geographical point of view. I mean, to Professor Bayley Balfour, 
of ]&lt;]dinburgh, who was actually invited by the Council to preside. He could 
liave handled the subject of your rich and peculiar Flora with detailed know- 
ledge; and, with the true Hookerian touch, he would have pictured to you in bold 
outlines its relation to present problems. Failing such equipment. I may at least 
claim to have made some of your rare and peculiar forms the subject of special 
study at intervals spread over thirty years : for it was in 1884 that I was supplied 
with living plants of Phyllofjlvssum by Baron Ferdinand von Miiller, while a 
paper to be published this year contains details of a number of Ferns kindly 
sent to me by various collectors from New Zealand. I have been personally 
interested more especially in your rare Pteridophytes, isolated survivals as they 
surely are of very ancient vegetation. I propose to indicate later in this Address 
some points of interest which they present. But first I shall offer some more 
general remarks on the history of the investigation of the Australian Flora, as 
a reminder of the recent death of Sir Joseph Hooker, whose work helped so 
oreatly to promote a philosophical knowledge of tlie Flora of this quarter of the 

f'lobe. 

Few, if any, of the large areas of the Earth's surface have developed their 
coat of' vegetation uiuler such interesting conditions as that which bears the 
Australasian Flora. In its comparative isolation, and in its freedom from the 
disturbing influence of man, it may be held as unique. We may picture to our- 
selves the field as having been open to evolutionary tendencies, unusually free

from the incursion of competitive foreign types, and with its Flora shaped and 
determined through long ages in the main by climatic influences. Naturally the 
controlling effect of animal life had been present throughout, as well as that of 
parasitic and fungal attack; but that potent artificial influence, the hand of man, 
was less effective here than in almost any other area. The aborigines were not 
tillers of the soil : in their digging for roots and such-like actions they might 
rank with the herbivorous animals, so far as they affected the vegetation. 
Probably the most powerful influence they exercised was through fire. And so 
the conditions remained, the native Flora being practically untouched, till the 
visit of Captain Cook in 1770 : for little account need be taken of the handful of 
specimens collected by Dampier in the seventeenth century. 

Captain Cook shipped with him in the Emh-m-oiir a very remarkable man, 
viz., Joseph Banks, whom Dr. jNIaiden has described as 'the Father of Australia.' 
He not only acted as the scientific director of the expedition, but he was also its 
financier. Educated at Eton and Oxford, he found himself as a young man 
possessed .of an ample fortune. Though devoted to field sports, he did not, like 
so many others, spend his life upon them. Following the dictates of a taste early 
awakened in him, he turned his attention to travel for scientific ends. His 
opportunity came when Cook was fitting out the Endeavour for his first voyage 
to the Southern Seas. Banks asked leave of the Admiralty to join the expedi- 
tion, which was granted, and he furnished all the scientific stores and a staff of 
nine persons at his own expense. 

The story of that great expedition of 1768 to 1771 is given in ' Cook's Voyages,' 
compiled by Dr. Hawkesworth, a book that may be found in every library. 
Though it is evident throughout that Banks took a leading part in the observa- 
tional work of the expedition, it has not been generally known how deeply 
indebted Hawkesworth was to Banks for the scientific content of his story. This 
became apparent only on the publication of Banks' own Journal 125 years after 
the completion of the voyage. The circumstances of this have a local interest, so 
I may be excused for briefly relating them. 

Banks' papers, including the MS. Journal, passed with his library and 
Herbarium on his death to his librarian, Eobert Brown. On the death of the 
latter they remained in the British Museum. But after lying there for a long 
period they were claimed and removed by a member of Banks' family, and were 
put up for auction. The Journal was sold for 11. 2s. Q,d., and the last that has 
been heard of it is that it came into the possession of a gentleman in Sydney. 
Perhaps it may be lying within a short distance of the spot where we are 
now met. This valuable record, fit to rank with Darwin's 'Voyage of the 
UvaijU; or Moseley's account of the ' Voyage of the Challenger ,' mig-ht thus have 
been wholly lost to the public had it not been for the care of Dawson-Turner, 
who had the original transcribed by his daughters, helped by his grandson! 
Joseph Dalton Hooker. The boy was fascinated by it, and doubtless it helped to 
stimulate to like enterprises that botanist to whom Australia owes so much. The 
copy thus made remained in the British Museum. Finally, from it in 1896 Sir 
Joseph Hooker himself edited the Journal, in a slightly abridged form. It is now 
apparent how very large" a share Banks actually took in the observation and 
recording, and how deeply indebted to him was the compiler of the account of 
the voyage published more than a century earlier, not only for facts, but even for 
lengthy excerpts. 

The plants collected in Australia by this expedition amounted to some l.CKW 
species, and with Banks' Herbarium they found, after his death, a home in the 
British Museum. Several minor collections were subsequently made in Australia 
but the next expedition of prime importance was that of Flinders in 1801 to 
1805. What made it botanically notable was the presence of Robert Brown. 
Hooker speaks of this voyage as being, ' as far as Botany is concerned, the most 
important in its results ever taken.' The collections came from areas'so widely 
apart as King George's Sound, Southern Tasmania, and the Gulf of Carpentaria. 
These, together with Banks' plants and other minor collections, formed the 
foundation for Brown's ' Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae,' a work which was 
described in 1860 by Sir Joseph Hooker as being ' though a fragment . . . the 
greatest botanical work that has ever appeared.' It was published in 1810. I 
must pass over without detailed remark the notable pioneer work of Allan 
Cunningham, and of some others. The next outstanding fact in the historv of 

1914. o 



562 TBANS ACTIONS OP SECTION K. 

Australian Botany was the voyage of Ross, with the Erebus and the Terror; iov 
with him was Joseph Hooker, whose botanical work gave an added distinction to 
an otherwise remarkable expedition. 

The prime object of the voyage was a magnetic survey, and this determined 
its course. But in the intervals of sailing the Antarctic Seas the two ships 
visited Ascension Island, St. Helena, the Cape, New Zealand, Australia, Tas- 
mania, Kerguelen Island, Tierra del Fuego, and the Falkland Islands. Thus 
Hooker had the opportunity of collecting and observing upon all the great cir- 
cumpolar areas of the Southern Hemisphere. He welded together the results into 
his great work ' The Antarctic Plora.' It was published in six large quarto 
volumes. In them about 3,000 species are described, while on 530 plates 1,095 
species are depicted, usually with detailed analytical drawings. But these mag- 
nificent volumes did not merely contain reports of explorations, or descriptions 
of the many new species collected. There was much more than this in them. 
All the known facts that could be gathered were incorporated, so that they 
became systematically elaborated and complete Floras of the several countries. 
Moreover, in the last of them, the ' Flora Tasmanias,' there is an Introductory 
Essay, in which the Australasian Flora was for the first time treated as a whole, 
and its probable origin and its relation to other Floras discussed. Further, ques- 
tions of the mutability and origin of species were also raised in it. The air was 
full of such questions in 1859 ; the essay was completed in November of that year, 
less than twelve months after the joint communications of Darwin and Wallace 
had been made to the Linnean Society, and before the ' Origin of Species ' was 
published. It -was to this essay that Darwin referred when Jie wrote that 
' Hooker has come round, and will publish liis belief soon.' But this publication 
of his belief in the mutability of species was not merely an echo of assent to 
Darwin's own opinion. It was a reasoned statement, advanced upon the basis 
of his ' own self-thought,' and his own wide systematic and geographical experi- 
ence. From these sources he drew support for ' the hypothesis that species are 
derivative and mutable.' He points cut how the natural history of Australia 
seemed specially suited to test such a theory, on account of the comparative 
uniformity of the physical features being accompanied by a great variety in its 
Flora, and the peculiarity of both its Fauna and Flora, as compared with other 
countries. After the test had been made on the basis of the study of some 
8,000 species of plants, their characters, their spread, and their relations to those 
of other lands, Hooker concluded decisively in favour of mutability, and a 
doctrine of progression. After reading this essay, Darwin wrote that it was to 
his judgment 'by far the grandest and most interesting essay on subjects of the 
nature discussed I have ever read.' 

But beyond its historical interest in relation to the ' Origin of Species,' 
Hooker's essay contained what was ujj to its time the most scientific treatment 
of a large area from the point of view of the Plant-Geographer. He found that 
the Antarctic, like the Arctic Flora, is very uniform round the Globe. The same 
sjjecies in many cases occur on every island, though thousands of miles of ocean 
may intervene. Many of these species reappear in the mountains of Southern 
Chili, Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand. The Southern Temperate Floras, 
on the other hand, of South America, South Africa, Australia, and New Zea- 
land differ more among themselves than do the Floi-a.s of Europe, Northern 
Asia, and North America. To explain these facts Hooker suggested the probable 
former existence, during a warmer period than the present, of a centre of 
creation of new species in the Southern Ocean, in the form of either a con- 
tinent or an archipelago, from which the Antarctic Flora radiated. From the 
zoological side a similar difficulty arises, and the hypothesis of a land-connec- 
tion has been widely upheld, and that it existed as late as Mid-Tertiary 
times. The theory took a more definite form in the hands of Osborn (1900), 
who pictured relatively narrow strips of land connecting resp)ectively South 
America on the one side and Tasmania and New Zealand on the other with 
the existing Antarctic land-area. This would accord well enough with the 
suggestion of Lowthian Green, that the plan of land-elevations on the Earth is 
approximately tetrahedral ; and it is, I believe, in line with the views of those 
who are best informed on Antarctic Geography and Geology, as studied from 
the land itself. It may be hoped that further Antarctic discovery may bring 
fresh facts to bear upon this question, for it is to the positive data acquired from 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 563 

study of the Earth's crust that we must look, rather than to tlie exigencies of 
botanists and zoologists, for its final solution. 

But the hypothesis of an Antarctic Land-Connection has been held open to 
doubt in various quarters. As Sir Wni. Thiselton Dyer has recently pointed out, 
Darwin himself dissented, though regretfully, from the sinking of imaginary 
continents in a quite reckless manner, and from the construction of land-bridges 
in every convenient direction. From the geological side Dana laid down the 
positive proposition that the Continents and Oceans had their general outline and 
form defined in earliest time. Sir John Murray, whose recent death we so deeply 
deplore, was an undeniable authority as to the Ocean-floor. He wrote quite 
recently with rcigard to Gondwana-land, that ' the study of Ocean-depths and 
Ocean-deposits does not seem in any way to support the view that continental 
land has disappeared beneath the floor of the Ocean in the manner indicated.' 
He suggested that the present distribution of organisms is better interpreted 
by the North Polar theory of origin. The ' continuous current of vegetation ' 
southward at the present time was recognised by Hooker himself, and definite 
streams of northern forms have been traced by him extending even to Australia 
and Tasmania. This might account for much in present-day distribution ; though 
it seems donbtful whether it would fully explain the extraordinary distribution 
of Antarctic Plants. The problem must for the present remain an open one. 

This whole question, however, has a connection with the still wider difficulty 
of the existence within the Polar area of ancient Floras. In the north the 
fossils are even of sub-tropical character. Coal has been found in lands with a 
five months' night. How did such plants fare if the seasonal conditions were at 
all like the present? To explain this it would be a physiological necessity to 
assume either an entirely different climatal condition in those regions from that 
of the present time; or, as has been suggested, some shifting or creeping of the 
Earth's crust itself. These are, however, questions which we cannot undertake 
to discuss with effect in the Botanical Section. We must not do more than 
recognise that an unsolved difficulty exists. 

We pass now from Hooker's great work to the last of the classical series, viz., 
the ' Flora Australiensis ' of Bentham and Baron Ferdinand von Miiller. It is 
embodied in seven volumes, and was completed in 1S78. Bentham, while assent- 
ing in his ' concluding preface ' to the principles laid down by Hooker in the 
Tasmanian Flora, recognised as the chief component part of the present Flora 
of Australia the indigenous genera and species, originated or differentiated in 
Australia, which never spread far out of it. Secondly, an Indo-Australian Flora 
showing an ancient connection between Australia and the lands lying to the 
north. It is represented especially in tropical and sub-tropical East Queens- 
land. Then there is the Mountain Flora common to New Zealand, and extend- 
ing generally to the southern extra-tropical and mountain regions, while other 
constituents are ubiquitous maritime plants, and those which have been intro- 
duced since the European colonisation. But the most remarkable, as they are 
the least easily explained, are some few plants identical with species from North 
and West America, and from the Mediterranean. They are stated to be chiefly 
annuals, or herbaceous or shrubby plants ; free-seeders ; while their seeds long 
retain the ipower of germination. This may perhaps give the clue to this curious 
conundrum of distribution. 

It has been fortunate that the duty of working out this remarkable Flora 
should have fallen into the hands of such masters as Robert Brown, Sir Joseph 
Hooker, and Bentham. The foundations were thus surely laid. The further 
progress of knowledge has been carried on by the late Baron Ferdinand von 
Miiller, and it may be confidently left in the hands of others who are still with 
us. The completion of the task of observing and recording may still be far 
ahead. But I may be pardoned if I utter a word of anticipatory warning. 
There is at the present time a risk that the mere work of tabulating and defining 
the species in a given country may be regarded as the only duty of a Government 
Botanist; that, whenever this is completed, his occupation will he gone. Some 
such erroneous idea, together with a short-sighted economy, is the probable 
explanation of the fact that certain positions hitherto held by professional 
botanists have recently been converted into positions to be held by agriculturists. 
In the countries where this has happened (and I refer to no part of Australasia) 
the vegetation had been very adequately, though not yet exhaustively, worked, as 

o 2

regards the Flowering Plants and Ferns. But who that knows anything about 
plants would imagine that the ascription to a genus or order, or the designation 
by a couple of Latin names with a brief specific description, exhausts what it 
is important to know about a species ? In most cases it is after this has been 
done that the real importance of its study begins. Such possibilities as these 
do not appear to have been appreciated by those who advised or controlled 
these official changes. I have no desire to undervalue the agriculturist or the 
important work which he does. But he is engaged in the special application 
of various pure sciences, rather than in pure science itself. Advance in the 
prosperity of any country which has progressed beyond the initial stages of 
settlement follows on the advance of such knowledge as the devotee of Pure 
Science not only creates, but is also able to inculcate in his pupils. It is then 
imperative that, in any state which actively progresses, provision shall be made 
for the pursuit of pure as well as of applied science. In my view an essential 
mistake has been made in changing the character of the appointments in question 
from that of botanists to that of agriculturists. For the change marks the 
abandonment of Pure Science in favour of its specialised and local application. 

The head of such an institution should always be a representative of Pure 
Science, thoroughly versed in the nascent developments of his subject. He could 
then delegate to specialists the work of following out into detail such various 
lines of special application as Agriculture, Acclimatisation, Plant-Breeding, 
Forestry, or Economics. Or, if the organisation were a large one, as we may 
anticipate that it would become in the Capital of a great State, separate 
Institutes might develop to serve the several applied branches, while to a 
central Institute, in touch with them all, might be reserved the duty of advanc- 
ing the Pure Science from which all should draw assistance and inspiration. 

It matters little how this principle works out in detail, if only the principle 
itself be accepted, viz., that Pure Science is tlie fount from which the practical 
applications spring. Sydney, as the Capital of a great State, has already laid 
her course, as regards Botanical Science, in accordance with it. Her Botanic 
Garden and the recently developed Botanical Department in the University 
(which, I understand, may find its home ultimately in the Botanic Garden) will 
serve as centres of study of the Pure Science of Botany. This will readily 
find its application to Agriculture, to Forestry, to Economics, and in various 
other lines present and future. I am convinced that it is in the best interest 
of any State that can possibly afford to do so to encourage and liberally endow 
the central establishment where the Pure Science of Botany is pursued, and to 
continue that encouragement and endowment, even though results of immediate 
practical use do not appear to be flowing from it at any given moment. For in 
these matters it is impossible to forecast what will and what will not be 
eventually of practical use. And in any case as educational centres the purely 
botanical establishments will always retain their important function of supplying 
that exact instruction, without which none can pursue with full effect a calling 
in the applied branches. 

We may now turn from generalities to certain special points of interest in 
your peculiar Flora which happen to have engaged my personal attention. They 
centre round a few rare and isolated plants belonging to the Pteridophyta, a 
division of the Vegetable Kingdom which there is every reason to believe to 
have appeared relatively early in the history of Evolution. But though the type 
may be an ancient one, it does not follow that every representative of it preserves 
the pristine features intact. Throughout the ages members of these early 
families may themselves have progressed. And so among them to-day we may 
expect to find some which preserve the ancient characters more fully than others. 
The former have stood still, and may be found to compare with curious exacti- 
tude with fossils even of very early date. The latter have advanced, and though 
still belonging to the ancient family, are by their modifications become essentially 
modern representatives of it. For instance, the Fern Angiopteris has a sorus 
which very exactly matches sori from the Palaeozoic period, and it may accord- 
ingly be held to be a very ancient type of Fern. On the other hand, the genera 
Asplenium, or Polypodium, include Ferns of a type which has not been recognised 
from e^rly fossil-bearing rocks, and they may be held to be essentially modern. 
But still all of them clearly belong to the family of the Ferns. 

In the Australian Flora only three of the four divisions of the Pteridophyta 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 565 

are represented. For, curiously enough, there does not appear to be any species 
on your Continent of the widely spread genus Equisetum, the only living genus 
of that great phylum of the Equisetales, which figured so largely in the Paleeozoio 
Period ; and this notwithstanding that one species (E. debile) is present among 
the Polynesian Islands. But all the three other divisions of the Pteridophyta 
are included, and are represented in each case by plants which show peculiar 
and probably for the most part archaic characters. I propose to sketch before 
you very briefly the points of interest which the more notable of these archaic 
types present. Some justification may be found for my doing so because 
nearly all of them have been submitted to detailed study in my laboratory in 
Glasgow, and much of the work has been done upon material supplied to me 
by your own Botanists. I take this opportunity of offering to them collectively 
my hearty thanks. 

The tenure by Dr. Treub of the office of Director of the Botanic Grardens of 
Buitenzorg was rendered famous by his personal investigations, and chiefly by 
liis classical researches on the Lycopods. These were followed up by other 
workers, and notably by Bruchmann ; so that we now possess a reasonable basis 
for comparison of the different types of the family as regards the prothallus and 
embryology, as well as of the sporophyte plant ; and all these characters must be 
brought together as a basis for a sound conclusion as to their phyletic seriation. 
The most peculiar living Lycopods are certainly Isoetes and Phylloglossum, both 
of which are found in Australia. The former need not be specially discussed 
here, as it is a practically world-wide genus. It must suffice to say that it is 
probably the nearest living thing to the fossils Lcpidndendron and SigiUaria, 
and may be described as consisting of an abbreviated and partially differentiated 
Lepidostrohus seated upon a contracted stigmarian base. 

But Phylloglossum, which is peculiar to the Australasian region, naturally 
claims special attention. The plant is well known to botanists as regards its 
external features, its annual storage tuber, its leafy shoot with protophylls and 
roots, and its simple shaft bearing the short strobilus of characteristic Lycopod 
type. But its prothallus has never been properly delineated, though it was 
verbally described by Dr. A. P. W. Thomas in 1901 (Proc. Roy. Soc, vol. 69, 
p. 285). Perhaps the completed statement may have been reserved as a pleasant 
surprise for this Meeting. But the description of thirteen years ago clearly 
shows its similarity to the type of Lycopodium cernuum. The sporophyte com- 
pares rather with L. inu/idatum. Both of these are species which, though 
probably not the most primitive of the genus, are far from being the most 
advanced. As all botanists know, the question of the position of Phylloglossum 
chiefly turns upon the view we take of the annual tuber and its protophylls. 
Treub, finding similar conditions in certain embryos of Lycopods, called it a 
'protocorm,' and believed that he recognised in it an organ of archaic nature, 
which had played an important part in the early establishment of the sporo- 
phyte in the soil, physiologically independent of the prothallus. I must not 
trouble you here with the whole argument in regard to this view. Facts which 
profoundly affect the conclusion are those showing the inconstancy of occurrence 
of the organ. Mr. Holloway has recently described it as of unusual size in your 
native L. lafcrale, as it is also in L. cernuum. But it is virtually absent in those 
species which have a large intraprothallial foot, such as L. clavatum, as well as 
in the genus SdagincUd and in Isoetes. In L. Sehigo. which on other grounds 
appears to be primitive, there is no ' protocorm.' Such facts appear to me 
to indicate caution. They suggest that the ' protocorm ' is an opportujiist local 
swelling of inconstant occurrence, which, though biologically important in some 
cases, is not really primitive. 

If this is the comparative conclusion, then our view will be that Phylloglossum 
is a type of Lycopod which has assumed, perhaps relatively recently, a very 
practical mode of annual growth. Related, as it appears to he on other points, 
with the L. 'mundatum group of species, it has bettered their mode of life. 
L. inundatum dies off each year to the very tip of its shoot, so that only the 
bud remains to the following season. It is notable that Goebel has described 
long ago how the young adventitious buds of this species start with small 
' protocorms,' quite like those of Phylloglossum itself, or like the embryo of 
Fj. cernuum. And so we may conclude that in Ph ylloglossum a tuberous develop- 
ment, containing a store to start the plant in the spring, has been added to what 



566 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K. 

is already seen normally each year in L. mundutmn. And this mode of life of 
I'hylloglossum begins, as Thomas has shown, with its embryo. This appears 
to me to be a rational explanation of the 'protocorm' of Phyllnglossum; 'but it 
robs the plant of much of its theoretical interest as an archaic form 

The phyliim of the Sphenopliyllales was originally based on certain slender 
straggling plants of the genus Sphenopliyllum found in the Palreozoic Rocks; 
but they apparently died out in the Permian Period. Your native genera 
Tmeslpteris and Psilatum were ranked by earlier botanists with the 
Lycopods, but a better acquaintance with their details, and especially the 
examination of numerous specimens on the spot, indicated a nearer affinity for 
them with the Sphenophyllales. It was Professor Thomas who in 1902 first 
suggested that the Psilotaceae might be included with the Sphenophyllre in the 
phylum of the Sphenophyllales, and I personally agree with him. Dr. Scott, 
however, dissents, on the ground that the leaves are persistently whorled in the 
sphenophylls, while they are alternate in the Psilotacepe ; and while the former 
branch monopodially the latter dichotomise. But since both of these characters 
are seen to be variable within the not far distant genus Lycopodivm, the differ- 
ences do not seem to me to be a sufficient ground for keeping them apart as the 
separate phyla of iSphenophyllales and Psilotales. Whatever degree of actual 
relation we trace, such plants as Tniesiptcris and Psilotitm are certainly the 
nearest living representatives of the Sphenophyllese, a fact which gives them a 
special distinction. The Psilotaceie also stand alone in the fact that they are 
the only family of the Pteridophytes in which the gametophyte is still unknown. 
They produce spores freely, but there the story stops. Aiiy young Australian 
who hits upon the way to induce these recalcitrant spores to germinate, and to 
produce prothalli and embryos, or who found their prothalli and embryos in the 
open, would have before him a piece of work as sensational as anything that 
could be suggested. Further, I am told that 7'mesipteris grows here on tlie 
matted stumps of Todea barbara. I shall be alluding shortly to the fossil 
OsmundaceaJ. May Ave not venture to fancy the possibility of some fossil 
Osmimda being found which has embalmed for us among its roots a Mesozoic 
or even a Tertiary Sphenophyll ? And thus a link might be found between the 
Palagozoic types and the modern Psilotacete, not only in time, but even in 
character. 

We pass now to the last phylum of the Pteridophyta, the Filicales. I am 
bound to say that for me its interest far outweighs that of the others, and for 
this reason. That it is represented by far the largest number of genera and 
species at the present day, while there is a sufficiently continuous and rich 
succession of fossil forms to serve as an efficient check upon our comparative 
conclusions. 

Since 1890 it has been generally accepted that the Eusporangiate Ferns (those 
with more bulky sporangia) were phyletically the more primitive types, and the 
Leptos])orangiate (those with more delicate sporangia) the derivative, and in 
point of time later. The fossil evidence clearly upholds this conclusion. But, 
further, it lias been shown that the character of the sporangium is merely an 
indicator of the general constitution of the plants in question. Where it is 
large and complex, as in the Eusporangiates, all the apical segmentations are, 
as a rule, complex, and the construction of the whole plant relatively bulky. 
Where the sporangium is delicate and relatively simple all the apical segmenta- 
tions follow suit, and the construction of the plant is on a less bulky model. 
On this basis we may range the Ferns roughly as a sequence, starting from 
relatively bulky types of the distant past, and progressing to the more delicate 
types of the present day. The large majority of the living species belong 
naturally to the latter. But the former are still represented by a few genera 
and species which, like other survivals from a distant past, are frequently of 
very restricted distribution. 

An interesting feature of the Australasian Flora is that a considerable 
number of these relatively ancient forms are included in it. Thus the 
Marattiaceie are represented by one species of Marattia and one of Angiopteris. 
Though in themselves interesting, they will be passed over without special 
remark, as they are very widely spread tropical forms. 

All tlie three genera of Ophioglossaceaj are included, there being two species 
of Ophioijlossum and two of Botrychium, while Hehnlnthostachys is recorded 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 567 

from Eockingham Bay. This Family is coming more than ever to the front in 
our comparisons, owing to their similarity in various aspects to the ancient 
Botryopteridete. Though the Ophioglossacere have no secure or consecutive fossil 
history, still they may now be accepted as being very primitive but curiously 
specialised Ferns. Perhaps the most interesting point recently detected in them 
is the suspensor found by Dr. Lyon in Botrychium ohliquum, and by Dr. Lang 
in Helmint/iosiac/ij/s. This provides a point for their comparison with the 
similar embryonic condition in Danaa, as demonstrated by Professor Campbell. 
The existence of a filamentous initial stage of the embryo is thus shown for 
three of the most primitive of living Ferns. Its existence in all of the Bryo- 
phytes, and in moat of the Lycopods, as well as in the Seed-Plants, is a very 
significant fact. Dr. Lang suggests that ' the suspensor represents the last trace 
of the filamentous juvenile stage in the development of the plant, and may have 
persisted in the Seed-Plants from their filicineous ancestry.' Such a possibility 
would fit singularly well with the theory of encapsulation of the sporophyte in 
the venter of the archegonium. 

The representation of the ancient family of the Osmnndacea; in the Australasian 
Flora is very fine, though limited to five living species, while Osmunda itself 
is absent. It is, however, interesting that the family dates back locally to early 
fossil times. It was upon two specimens of OsmnncUtes from the Jurassic Rocks 
in the Otago district of New Zealand that the- series of remarkable papers on 
' The Fossil Osmundacepe ' by Kidston and G-wynne-Vaughan was initiated. It 
is no exaggeration to say that these papers have done more than any other 
recent researches to promote a true understanding not only of the OsmundaceEe 
themselves, but of Fern-Anatomy as a whole. They have placed the stelar 
theory in Ferns for the first time upon a basis of comparison, checked by refer- 
ence to stratigraphical sequence. It would be leading us too far for me to 
attempt here to summarise the important results which have sprung from the 
study of those fossils, so generously placed by Wr. Dunlop in the hands of those 
exceptionally able to turn them to account. It must sufllce to say that it is now 
possible to trace as a fairly continuous story the steps leading from the proto- 
stelic state to the complex condition of the modern Osmunda. These facts and 
conclusions are to be put in relation with the anatomical data fast accumulating 
from the Ophioglossacese in the hands of Professor Lang and others. From 
such comparisons a rational explanation of the evolutionary steps leading to the 
complex stelar state in Ferns at large begins to emerge. This is no mere tissue 
of surmises, for the conclusions are based on detailed conijiarison of types occur- 
ring in lower horizons with those of the present day. 

I must pass over with merely nominal mention your interesting representa- 
tion of the ancient families of Schizsacese, Gleicheniacere, and Hymenophyllacew, 
all of which touch the very foundations of any phyletic system of Ferns. Also 
the magnificent array of Dicksoniere. and Cyathea?, and of the important genus 
Lindsaya— Ferns wliich take a rather higher position in point of view of 
descent. But I am bound to devote a few moments to one of your most remark- 
able Ferns, endemic in New Zealand — the monotypic Loxsoma. 

This species has peculiar characters which justify its being regarded system- 
atically as the sole representative of a distinct Tribe. It is also restricted 
geographically to the North Island of New Zealand. These facts at once sug-- 
gest that it is an ancient survival, a conclusion with which its solenostelic axis, 
its sorus and sporangium, and its prothallus readily accord. I have lately shown 
that the Leptosporangiate Ferns fall into two distinct Series, those in which the 
origin of the sorus is constantly superficial, and those in which it is as con- 
stantly marginal. Loxsoma is one of the ' Marginales.' It shares this position 
with the Schizjeacefe, Thyrsopteridere, Hymenophyllacew, and Dicksoniere, and 
the derivatives Davallieseand Oleandrefe. Its nearest living relative is probably 
Thyrsopteris, which is again a monotypic species endemic in the Island of Juan 
Fernandez. There is also a probable relation to the genus Loxsomopsis, repre- 
sented by one species from Costa Rica, and a second lately discovered in Bolivia. 
Such a wide and isolated distribution of types, which by their characters are 
certainly archaic, suggests that we see in them the relics of a Filicineous state 
once widely spread, which probably sprang from a Schizreaceous source, and 
with tlieni rcjiresent the Foreruniiors of the whole Marginal Series. If we look 
for further enlightenment from the fossils, it is to the Secondary Rocks that we 



568 TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION K. 

should turn. It is then specially interesting that Mr. Hamshaw Thomas has 
lately described a new Jurassic Fern, Stachypteris Halli, which has marginal 
sori, and is probably referable to a position like that of Loxsoma and Thyrso- 
pteris, between the Schizfeaceae and the Dicksonieae. In fact the gaps in the 
evolutionary series of the Marginales are filling up. We may await with con- 
fidence fresh evidence from the Jurassic Period, upon which Professor Seward is 
directing an intensive interest 

I should be ungrateful indeed if I did not mention your very full representa- 
tion of Blechnoid Ferns : for developmental material of several of these has been 
sent to me by Dr. Cockayne, and others from New Zealand. A wide compara- 
tive study of the genus has led me to somewhat unexpected results in regard to 
the plasticity of the sorus, its phyletic fusions and disruptions. The consequent 
derivative forms are seen in Wooclwardia and Doodya on the one hand, and on 
the other in Scolopendrium and Asplenium. These Ferns together constitute a 
coherent phylum springing ultimately from a Cyatheoid source. The details 
upon which this conclusion is based I hope to describe in a separate communica- 
tion to the Section. 

And lastly, the Hydropterideae deserve brief mention. Represented in your 
Flora by two species of Azolla, and one each of MutsUcci and Pilularia, they 
typify a condition which must theoretically have existed among Ferns in very 
early times, viz., the heterosporous state. But hitherto, notwithstanding the 
existence of our living Hydropterideae, no fossil Fern with microscopic structure 
preserved had been detected from the Primary Rocks, showing this intermediate 
condition between the homosporous type and that of the Pteridosperms. This 
unsatisfactory position has now been resolved by Professor Lignier, who has 
recently described, under the name of Mittagia^ a fossil from the Lower West- 
phalian, which bore sori of which the sporangia contained four megaspores, 
while the outer tissues of the sporangia resembled those of Lagenostoma. 
Pending the discovery of further specimens, these observations may be welcomed 
as filling with all probability a conspicuous gap in the evolutionary sequence of 
known forms. 

From the rapid survey which I have been able to give you of some of the more 
notable Australasian Ferns of relatively archaic type, it is clear that they have a 
very inter3Sting and direct bearing upon the phylesis of Ferns. The basis upon 
which conclusions as to phyletic sequence are arrived at is at root that of the 
Natural System of Classification generally — the recognition not of one character, 
or of two, but of as many as possible, which shall collectively serve as criteria of 
comparison. In the case of the Filicales we may use the characters of : — 

(i) External form. 

(ii) Constitution, as shown by simple or complex segmentation. 

(iii) Dermal appendages, hairs or scales. 

(iv) Stelar structure, simple or complex. 
(v) Leaf-trace, coherent or divided. 

(vi) Soral position. 

(vii) Soral construction, 
(viii) Indusial protections. 

(ix) Sporangial structure, and mechanism of dehiscence. 
(x) Spore-output. 

(xi) Spore-form, and character of wall. 

(xii) Form of prothallus. 

(xiii) Position of the sexual organs, sunken or superficial 
(xiv) Number of spermatocytes, and method of dehiscence. 

(xv) Embryology. 

In respect of all these criteria progressions of character may be traced as 
illustrated by known Ferns, and probably other criteria may emerge as study 
progresses. In each case, upon a footing of general comparison, checked as 
opportunity offers by reference to the .stratigraphical sequence of the fossils, it 
may be possible to distinguish with some degree of certainty what is relatively 
primitive from what is relatively advanced. Thus, the protostele is generally 
admitted to be more primitive than the dictyostele, the simple hair than the 
flattened scale, and a high spore-output than a low one. 

Applying the conclusions thus arrived at in respect of the several criteria, it 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 569 

becomes possible upon the sum of them to lay out the species and genera of Ferns 
themselves in series, from the primitive to the advanced. In proportion as the 
progressions on the basis of the several criteria run parallel, we derive increased 
assurance of the rectitude of the phyletic sequences thus traced, which may finally 
be clinched, as opportunity offers, by reference to the stratigraphical occurrence 
of the corresponding fossils. This is in brief the phyletic method, as it may be 
applied to Ferns. It may with suitable variation be applied to any large group of 
organisms, though it is seldom that the opportunities for such observation and 
argument are in any sense commensurate with the requirements. Perhaps there 
is no group of plants in which the opportunities are at the moment so great as in 
the Filicales, and they are yielding highly probable results from its application. 

The greatest obstacle to success is found in the prevalence of parallel develop- 
ment in phyla which are believed to have been of distinct origin. This is 
exemplified very freely in the Ferns, and the systematist has frequently been 
taken in by the resemblances which result from it. He has grouped the plants 
which show certain common characters together as members of a single genus. 
Sir William Hooker in doing this merged many genera of earlier writers. His 
avowed object was not so much to secure natural affinity in his system as readiness 
of identification : and consequently in the ' Synopsis 1' ilicum ' there are nominal 
genera which are not genera in the phyletic sense at all. For instance, Polij- 
[ludiiun and Acrof^tir/iiini, as there defined, may be held from a phyletic point of 
view to be collective groupings of all such Ferns as have attained a certain state 
of development of their sorus ; and that they are not true genera in the sense of 
being associated by any kinship of descent : this is shown by the collective 
characters of the plants as a whole. Already at least four different phyletic 
sources of the Acrostichoid condition have been recognised, and probably the 
sources of the Polypodioid condition are no fewer. Such 'genera ' represent the 
results of a phyletic drift, which may have affected similarly a plurality of lines 
of descent. It \vill be the province of the systematist who aims at a true group- 
ing according to descent to comb out these aggregations of species into their 
true relationships. This is to be done by the use of wider, and it may be quite 
new, criteria of comparison. Advances are being made in this direction, but we 
are only as yet at the beginning of the construction of a true phyletic grouping of 
the Filicales. The more primitive lines are becoming clearer : but the diflSculty 
will be greatest with the distal branches of the tree. For these represent 
essentially the modern forms, they comprise the largest number of apparently 
similar species, and in them parallel development has been most prevalent. 

If this difficulty be found in such a group as the Filicales, in which the earlier 
steps are so clearly indicated by the related fossils, what are we to say for the 
Angiosperms? Our knowledge of their fossil progenitors is very fragmentary. 
But they are represented now by a multitude of forms, showing in most of their 
features an irritating sameness. For instance, vascular anatomy, that great 
resource of phyletic study in the more primitive types, has sunk in the Angio- 
sperms to something like a dead level of uniformity. There is little variety 
found in the contents of embryo-sacs, in the details of fertilisation, or in 
embryology. Even the ontogeny as shown in the seedling stages affords little 
consolation to the seeker after recapitulation. On the other hand, within what 
are clearly natural circles of affinity there is evidence of an extraordinary readi- 
ness of adaptability in form and structure. Such conditions suggest that we see 
on the one hand the far-reaching results of parallel development, and on the other 
the effects of great plasticity at the present day, or in relatively recent times. 
Both of these are points which prevent the ready tracing of phyletic lines. In 
the absence of reliable suggestions from paL-eontology, the natural consequence is 
the current state of uncertainty as to the phyletic relations of the Angiosperms. 

Various attempts have been or are being made to meet the difficulty. Some, 
on the basis of the recent observations of Wieland and others, are attempting 
along more or less definite monophyletic lines to construct, rather by forcible 
deduction than by any scientific method of induction, an evolutionary story of the 
Angiosperms. I do not anticipate that any great measure of success, beyond 
what is ^hown in a very polysyllabic terminology, and an appearance of knowing 
more than the facts can quite justify, will attend such efforts. It would seem 
to me to be more in accord with the dictates of true science to proceed in a 
different way, as indeed many workers have already been doing. To start not 



570 TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION K. 

from preconceptions based upon limited palaeontological data, but from an inten- 
sive study of the living plants themselves. To widen as far as possible the 
criteria of comparison, by making, for instance, every possible use of cellular, 
physiologico-chemical, and especially secretory detail, and of minor formal 
features, such as the dermal appendages, or by initiating a new developmental 
morphology of the flower from the point of view of its function as a whole : and 
with its physiological end clearly in sight, viz., the maturing, nourishing, and 
placing of new germs. To make on some such basis intra-ordinal, and intra- 
generic comparisons with a view to the phyletic seriation of closely related forms ; 
and so to construct probable short series, which may subsequently be associated 
into larger phyletic groupings. This should be checked wherever possible by 
physiological probability. A keen eye should be kept upon such information as 
geographical distribution and palaeontology may afford, and especially upon the 
fossils of the Mesozoic Period. What is above all needed for success among the 
Angiosperms is new criteria of comparison, to meet the far-reaching difficulties 
that follow from parallel development and recent adaptation. If some such 
methods be adopted, and strenuously pressed forward, the task should not appear 
hopeless, though it cannot be anything else than an arduous one. 

I cannot conclude without some remark on the hearing of parallel or conver- 
gent development, so fully exemplified in the Filicales, upon the question of the 
genesis of new forms. Anyone who examines, from the point of view suggested 
in this Address, the larger and well-represented divisions of the Vegetable King- 
dom must be impressed with the extraordinary dead level of type to which their 
representatives have attained. In most of these divisions the phyletic history is 
obscured, pai-tly by the absence of any consecutive palseontological record, but 
chiefly by the want of recognised criteria for their comparison. This is very 
prominently the case for the Mosses, and the Angiosperms. 

But it may be doubted whether these large groups differ in any essential point, 
in respect of the genesis of their multitudinous similar forms, from the Filicales, 
in which the lines of descent are becoming clearer through additional knowledge. 
Suppose that we knew of no fossil Ferns ; and that none of the early Fern-types 
included imder the term ' Simplices ' had survived in our living Flora : and that 
the Filicales of our study consisted only of the 2,500 living species of the old 
undivided genera of Pohjpodium, Asplenhivi, Aspidhim, and Acrostichitm. Then 
the phyletic problem of the Filicales would appear as obscure as does that of the 
Mosses, or of the Angiosperms of the present day. They would present, as these 
great groups now do, an apparent dead level of sameness in type, though the 
phyletic starting-points in each may have been several and distinct. There is 
every reason to suppose that in the phylesis of the Mosses or the Angiosperms also 
there has been a parallel, and even a convergent, development of the same nature 
as that which can be cogently traced in the Filicales : but that it is obscured by 
the obliteration of the early .stages. Internal evidence from their comparative 
study fully justifies this conclusion. How, then, are we to regard this insistent 
problem of parallelism and convergence from the point of view of genetic study ? 

A belief in the ' inheritance of acquired characters,' or, as it is sometimes 
expressed. ' somatic inheritance,' is at present out of fashion in some quarters. 
But though powerful voices may seem to have forced it for the moment into the 
background, I would take leave to point out that such inheritance has not been 
disproved. All that has been done, so far as I understand the position, is to show 
that the evidence hitherto advanced in support of it is insufficient for a positive 
demonstration. That is a very different thing from proving the negative. We 
hear of ' Fluctuating Variations ' as distinct from ' Mutations ' ; and it is 
asserted that the former are somatic, and are not inherited, while the latter are 
inherited. This may be held as a useful terminological distinction, in so far as 
it accentuates a difference in the heritable quality. But it leaves the question of 
the origin of these heritable 'Mutations' quite open. At the present moment I 
believe that actual knowledge on this point is very like a complete blank. Fur- 
ther, it leaves indefinite the relative extent and proportion of the 'Mutations.' 
It is commonly held that mutations are considei-able deviations from type. I 
am not aware that there is any sufficient ground for such a view. It may 
probably have originated from the fact that the largest ai'e most readily observed 
and recognised as reappearing in the offspring. But this is no justification for 
ignoring the possibility of all grades of size or importance of heritable deviations 
from type. 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 571 

On tlm otlicr liaud, adaptation, witli its consequence of parallel or even eon- 
vei'gent development in distinct stocks, is an insistent problem. The real ques- 
tion is. What causes are at work to produce such results ? They are usually set 
down to the selection of favourable divergences from type out of those produced 
at random. But the prevalence of parallelism and convergence suggests that 
those inheritable variations, which are now styled 'Mutations,' are not pro- 
duced at random. The facts enforce the question whether or not they are 
promoted and actually determined in their direction, or their number, or their 
quality, in some way, by the external conditions. Parallelism and convergence 
in phyletip lines which are certainly distinct impress the probability that they 
are. Until the contrary is proved it would, in my opinion, be wiser to entertain 
some such view as a working hypothesis than positively to deny it. Such a 
working hypothesis as this is not exactly the same as a ' mnemic theory,' though 
it is closely akin to it. It may perhaps be regarded as the Morpliologist's pre- 
sentation, while the mnemic theory is rather that of the Physiologist. But the 
underlying idea is the same — viz., that the impress of external circumstance 
cannot properly be ruled out in the genesis of inheritable diaracters, simply 
because up to the present date no definite case of inheritance of observable 
characters acquired in the individual lifetime has been demonstrated. Of 
course, I am aware that to many this is flat heresy. At this Meeting of the 
Association it amounts almost to high treason. I plead guilty to this heresy, 
which may by any sudden turn of observation be transformed into the true 
faith. I share it in whole or in part with many botanists, with men who have 
lived their lives in the atmosphere of experiment and observation fomid in large 
Botanic Gardens, and not least with a former President of the British Associa- 
tion — viz.. Sir Francis Darwin. 

It is noteworthy how large a number of botanists dissent from any absolute 
negation of the influence of the environment upon the genesis of heritable 
characters. Partly this may be due to a sense of the want of cogency of the 
argument that the insufliciency of the positive evidence hitherto adduced 
justifies the full negative statement. But I think it finds its real origin in the 
fact that in Plants the generative cells are not segregated early from the somatic. 
In this respect they differ widely from that early segregation of germ-cells in 
the animal body, to which Weismann attached so much importance. The fact is 
that the constitution of the higher Plants and of the higher Animals is in this, 
as in many other points, radically different, and arguments from the one to the 
other are dangerous in the extreme. Those who interest themselves in evolu- 
tionary questions do not, I think, sufficiently realise that the utmost that can be 
claimed is analogy between the higher terms of the two kingdoms. Their 
phyletic separation certainly dates from a period prior to that of which we have 
any knowledge from the fossil record. Let us give full weight to this fact, as 
important as it is indisputable. The early definition of germ-cells in the animal 
body will then count for nothing in the evolutionary problem of plants. More- 
over, we shall realise that the plant, with its late segregation of germ-cells, will 
present the better field for the inquiry whether, and how far, the environment 
may influence or induce divergences from type. From this point of view the 
widespread opinion among botanists that the environment in some sense deter- 
mines the origin and nature of divergences from type in Plants should com- 
mand a special interest and attention. 

I must now draw to a close. I have passed in review some of your more 
notable_ plants, and pointed out how the Australasian Flora, whether living or 
fossil, includes in unusual richness those evidences upon which the fabric of 
evolutionary history is being based. I have indicated Jiow this history in certain 
groups is showing ever more and more evidence of parallel development, and that 
such development, or convergence, presses upon us the inquiry into th-e methods 
of evolutionary progress. The illustrations I have brought forward in this 
address clearly show how important is the positive knowledge derived from the 
fossils in checking or confirming our decisions. Pal:eophytology is to be prized 
not as a separate science, as, with an enthusiastic view restricted between 
blinkers, a recent writer has endeavoured to enforce. To treat it so would be 
to degrade it into a mere side alley of study, instead of holding it to be the 
most positive line that we possess in the broad avenue of Botanical Phylesis. 
An appreciation of such direct historical evidence is no new idea. Something

of the same sort was felt by Shakespeare tPiree centuries ago, and it remains the 
same to-day. Nay more : — it may lead us even to forecast future possibilities. 
In following our evolutionary quest in this spirit we shall find that we are

1. Tlie Douhlc Sluch — lis Hislonj and Behaviour. 
By Miss E. R. Saunders. 

■ There is some evidence that the cultivation of the garden Stock dates back 
to Greek and Roman times, the double-flowered plant being then unknown and 
presumably not in existence. 

There appears to be no definite record of the time or place of first appearance 
of the double form, but for various reasons we may conclude that it made its 
appearance only shortly before the date when it is first mentioned (middle of 
.sixteenth century). A comparison of the frequency of reference to the double form 
of the three genera included at this time under the same name [Leucoium or 
Viola), viz., the Violet, the Wallflower, and the Stock, seems to show that they 
arose successively in the order named. 

The original method of propagation of the double Stock (which is sterile) 
was by slips or cuttings, the double having appeared first in the biennial types. 
The fact that the double was obtainable from the seed of singles was not 
generally known for more than a century after the plant was in cultivation. 
Many different methods of procedure and treatment have been advocated from 
time to time as leading to the production or increase of double-flowered plants, 
but none liave stood the test of experiment. 

Mendelian methods of analysis have enabled us to arrive at an understanding 
of the relation of the double to the single, and have shown that the output 
of doubles is constant and independent of external conditions. By appropriate 
selection, in some cases of seeds, in others of the young plants, it is sometimes 
possible to obtain, not an increased output of doubles by the individual, but an 
increased proportion of double plants in the flower-beds. 



2. 0)1 the Sex Dimorphism and Secondary Sex Characters in some 
Abnormal Begonia Flowers, and on the Evolution of the MonoRcious 
Condition in Plants. By C. I. Bond. 

In certain Begonias the presence of an abnormal floral bract frequently indi- 
cates an associated abnormality of the sex organs in the flower which terminates 
the pedicle on which the abnormal floral bract appears. This abnormality may 
take various forms, from simple multiplication or modification of accessory floral 
parts to complete hermaphroditism. The relative position of the male and 
female sex organs on the floral axis indicates whether the flower is primarily 
male or primarily female. 

Tlie Tcniiinal Position oj the Male Flower in the Normal Begonia Inflorescence. 

The dioecious, the monoecious, and the hermaphrodite forms of sex dimorphism 
are the result of a process of qualitative cell division among different cell units, 
at different stages of their development. This sex differentiating cell division 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K. 573 

may occur in tlie germ-cell and produce the dioecious form, or it may occur during 
Hower bud differentiation and produce the monoecious condition, or it may be 
delayed to a later stage when the sex organs are differentiated on a common 
floral axis. The hermaphrodite flower is then formed. The actual disposition 
of the male and female sex organs may also follow one of two types : (a) Female- 
ness central and terminal and maleness peripheral and lateral, as in many in- 
florescences and probably all hermaphrodite flowers ; (b) Maleness central and 
terminal and femaleness lateral and peripheral, as in many inflorescences of the 
monoecious type snd in some abnormal Begonia flowers. The type assumed, 
primarily female or primarily male, will depend on the position taken by the 
factors for maleness and femaleness respectively during the differentiating cell 
division, and on which factor passes into the terminal and which into the lateral 
daughter cells. 

The Bearing of these Facts on Plant Evolution. 

The monoecious condition is probably an intermediate and unstable stage. 

The hermaphrodite flower (which is probably the result of necessity for 
adaptation to insect fertilisation) has been brought about by delaying the segre- 
gation of the (J and $ sex organs till the period of the development of the 
flower. Probably also some hermaphrodite plants may have accelerated the pro- 
cess of sex differentiation. If this occurs early during the evolution of the inflor- 
escence such plants would revert to the monoecious condition. 

In animals postponement of the process of sex differentiation from the germ- 
cell to the zygote stage also produces hei-maphroditism. Certain abnormalities 
in the distribution of secondary sex characters in the higher animals suggest 
that the development of the individual organism proceeds along two main lines, 
a segmental and a bilateral line. Lateral and segmental gynandromorphs are 
thus produced. 

The Secontlaiy Sex Characters of the Flowers of the Monoecious Begonia. 

The two processes of qualitative cell division which result in (1) the differ- 
entiation of the ^ and $ primary sex organs, and (2) the differentiation of the 
secondary sex characters, are less intimately interdependent in plants than in 
animals. This greater independence may depend upon tlie absence of, or the 
very restricted circulation of, internal secretions or sex hormones in the case of 
plants. 



3. Some Account of the Flora of the Norlhern Terrilory. By Alfred 
J. EwART, D.Sc, Ph.D., and Oijve B. D.wies, M.S'c. 

As is well known, the Commonwealth Government, since taking over the 
Northern Territory, has carried out a policy of energetically investigating the 
natural resources of this tract of country. 

In addition to the expedition by Gilruth and Spencer, the Barclay expedition 
traversed a large part of the Territory, and ]\Ir. Hill, the collector attached to 
the party, made large collections of plants. 

Dr. A. Morrison was appointed to assist in the work of investigating these 
collections and the flora of the Territory generally. In July 1913 he published 
a Paper with Professor Ewart, ' Contributions to the Flora of Australia,' 
No. 21 : 'The Flora of the Northern Territory (Leguminosse).' Unfortunately, 
before he could publish anything further he became seriously ill, and died in 
December 1913. 

Miss Davies was appointed successor to Dr. Morrison, and began work in 
February 1914. 

Mr. Maiden has undertaken the investigation of the Myrtaceae and of the 
Acacias, in which groups his knowledge is unrivalled. 

The present Paper not only gives much additional information as to the 
distribution of the plants in the Territory, but includes several new species : 
among which are four new species of Leguminosse, Isofropis argentea, Ewart 
and Morrison ; Jachsonia anomala, Ewart and Morrison ; Psoralea luteosa, Ewart 
and Morrison; Tephrosia 'pubescens, Ewart and Morrison; two new species of 
Proteacete, Hahea digyna, Ewart and Davies; and Hahea intermedia, Ewart and

Davies ; the former being especially interesting as showing a tendency to fusion 
of the pedicels, thus forming two carpels on one pedicel or in one flower ; and 
one new species of ClienopodiaceEe, A triplex varia, Ewart and Davies. 

Very little is known as yet as to the economic properties of the plants of the 
Northern Territory, more particularly as regards their fodder value or poisonous 
properties. In the present investigation special attention is being paid to those 
plants possessing either of these properties. Dr. Gilruth obtained data during 
his first visit of the food value of certain grasses, which have since been 
identified and published in the '19th Contribution to the Flora of Australia.' 

Ewart and Morrison remark on the Leguminosse : — 

' The Leguminosfe include not only many of the most valuable fodder plants, 
but also many poisonous plants. Few of the plants on the present list have been 
tested as yet from this point of view, but poisonous species are known to occur 
in the following genera : — Bauhinia has three poisonous species, one of which is 
a fish poison, and another an anthelmintic, but no data are available for the 
.species of this genus on the present list. Brachysema umhiJntum grows in 
other parts of Australia, and causes mechanical injury. Canavalia ohtu&amp;ifolin 
causes gastro-enteritis in stock. 

Several species of Cassia are considered poisonous, and, according to Greshoff, 
this also applies to Cassia SopJiora and C. Sturtii. No less than five species of 
Crotalaria are recorded as poisonous, and of tliese one, C. Mi/cJielli, grows in 
the Northern Territory. Three species of Erythrina and two of Erythrophlceum. 
have been recorded as poisonous, but they do not include any of the species 
growing in the Territory. The Asiatic Fhmingia congesta is a trenifuge, but 
the F. lineata of the Territory has not been tested. Many species of Gastro- 
lobium are poisonous, but only one incompletely tested species {G. gra7uIiflorui)i) 
is included in the present list. 

IncJigofera bovipcrda, however, has in West Australia been responsible for 
large losses of stock. The genera Pliaseolus, Psoralea, and Scsbariea include 
poisonous species, but apparently none from the Territory. NJiynchosia minima 
is, however, poisonous according to CJreshoff, and the same may be found 
ultimately to apply to some of the species of Swainsonin and Teplirosia. Several 
species of the latter genus are well-known fish poisons, and this applies to at 
least one species from the Territory, namely, Teplirosia purpvrea. In this 
direction there is much work to be done in the future. 

Included in the present work is a map illustrating the route taken by the 
expedition, and showing the more important plants collected at each station, 
that is, those which give some indication of the natural resources of the country. 



4. The Flora of the E)ivirons of Melhourne. 
By 0. S. Sutton, M.B., Ch.B. 

Introductory- — The consideration of our flora in its relation to the factors 
responsible and the estimation of these in explaining the distribution and 
association of its species have as yet been undertaken only tentatively. 

Physiography. — The district to be considered is somewhat arbitrarily restricted 
to an area within ft radius of almost thirty miles from Melbourne. The greater 
part of this is of low or moderate elevation and contains three main geological 
formations : — (1) From N.W. to S.W. a flat plain of the newer basalt gently 
sloping to sea-level from an elevation of almost 1,000 feet, drained by a simple 
river system in many places canyon-like. 

(2) From N.E. a more diversified extent of Silurian formation, including, 
however, a considerable area of plutonic rocks where the highest elevations, 2,0fl0 
to 2,600 feet, are to be found; the whole drained by the Yarra and its tributaries. 

(3) To the S.E. the area of Tertiary sands with an undulating surface rarely 
attaining 200 feet. Here the drainage system is ill-marked and over a great part 
hardly apparent. 

Ecological Conditions. — (a) Climatic. — ^Although the rainfall is pretty evenly 
distributed over all the months, the bulk of it occurs in winter and spring. The 
average annual fall ranges from about 16 inches at the station in the basaltic area 
to more than 50 inches in the Silurian. Snow very rarely falls. The temperature 
only occasionally surmounts 100° F., and the highest tempei'atures do not long 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K. 575 

persist. The mean annual humidity is high, and the annual evaporation low as 
compared with other parts of the Commonwealth. 

{b) Edapliic. — The soil of the three areas presents well-marked differences. 

The influence of man and of the domestic animals is everywhere manifest. 

Plant Formations. — ^The vegetation of the district is clearly divisible into 
three formations corresponding strikingly with the geologic formations. They 
would thus seem to be mainly determined by the soil conditions. 

(a) That of the basaltic area, a grass stej^pe with low herbs and a minimum 
of tree-growth, occurring in savannah form and in the river bottoms. 

{b) That of the Silurian area, a forest formation sometimes open but more 
often filled in with scrub and characterised by many species of Eucalyptus. 

((■) The flora of the Tertiary sands, marked by a predominance of Epacrids, 
myrtaceous plants, and terrestrial orchids, constituting a scrub heath in maqiiis 
and separated from the strand by a belt of higher scrub containing several tree- 
forms. 

(d) An association of halophytes peopling the strand and the salt-swamps at 
the mouths of watercourses. 

CciisH-s. — Lists of plants from the three formations show the greatest variety 
in the forest area where the most favourable and varied conditions exist, and the 
smallest total in the basaltic area. 



5. Australian Ebenacece. By W. P. Hieen, M.A., F.R.S. 

The ebony family is represented in Australia by nineteen species, out of about 
487 species in all. Twelve species are endemic in Austi-alia. The Northern 
Territory, Queensland, and New South Wales supply the species. There are 
none in Tasmania. 

In my Monograph of Ebenaceaj, published in 1873, I included among 262 
recent species sixteen as occurring in Australia — ten of the genus Maba, and six 
of Dlospyros. 

Subsequent additions include two species, each contributing a genus to the 
Australian Flora. lioyena villosa, a South African shrub, has been recorded 
from the Brisbane river in Queensland. Eiiclca uustraliensis was described by 
me in the ' Journal of Botany,' 1910, p. 159; the specimen was found among a set 
of Australian plants collected long previously by Sir T. L. Mitchell ; it probably 
came from extra-tropical Queensland. A new species of Diospyros, D. lon&lt;jip&lt;:s 
is the latest addition. 

In 1879 Hans Molisch published a jsaper on the comparative anatomy of the 
timbers of Ebenaceas and allies ; this paper included an account of the minute 
structure of the stem of Maba obocata. 

In 1892 Paul Parmentier published a work on the comparative histology of 
Ebenacese ; in this work he favoured the view that every good species can be 
easily defined by the epharmotic characters belonging to it. His researches dealt 
exclusively with the leaves and stems. With regard to the leaves the parts which 
he studied were : 1. The upper and lower epidermis. 2. The blade, sections 
being made at different places along it. 3. The mid-rib and lateral veins. 
4. The petiole, at the base of the blade, and in transverse sections. With regard 
to the stems, he studied all the tissues shown by transverse sections, and by radial 
and tangential sections of the liber and wood. Among the 120 species and 
varieties which he examined are Boyena villosa, Maba rufa, M. buxifolia, 
M. obovata, M. geminata, M. humilis, M. reticulata, Diospyros Ebenum, D. laxa, 
D. montana, D. pentamera, and D. microcardia. 

For the present paper numerous original observations have been made in order 
to test and extend the epharmosis of the Australian species. The pollen also 
has been observed and measured in the cases of the Boyena and Euclea. 

According to Parmentier the two last-named genera are distinguishable from 
the rest of Ebenaceous genera by the periderm of the stem arising from the 
pericycle, instead of being sub-epidermal. 

Hypoderma (arranged in a single row in both faces of the leaves) exists 
in Maba huinHi.-s. in Avhich .species also the cells of each epidermis are undulate. 

Stomates are furnished only on tlie lower face of the leaves ; they are numer- 
ous and correspond to the Ranunculaceous type, and are mostly sub-epidermal, 



576 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K. 

or ill a few S25ecies immersed, or {among Australian species) are exserted in 
Diospyros laxa. 

The mesophyll is bifacial in the majority of species, but sub-central in 
D. fentamera. 

The palisade cells are usually arranged in a single row, but in the leaves of 
D. inicrocarjia they are in two rows, and a similar biseriate arrangement has 
been observed in the leaves of D. longipes.

1. Modern Derivatives of the Matonioid Ferns. 
By Professor P. 0. Bower, ScB., F.R.S. 

Cheirophuria hicuspis (Bl.), Presl, is a fern of the Malayan region, and is 
often associated locally with Dipt er is. It is known chiefly from the drawings of 
Sir W. Hooker, and has not been submitted to recent comparative examination. 

On material supplied, through the influence of the Rajah of Sarawak, by 
Mr. Aloulton, keeper of the Museum, it has been found that it shows characters 
relating it on the one hand to GleicJtenia, Mutonia, and Dipteris, on the other to 
Plalycerium. It is, in fact, a synthetic type. 

Its creeping or scandent axis bears alternate leaves, with occasional abaxial 
buds on their bases, as in Lopliosoria and Metaxya. The dermal appendages arc 
hairs only. The leaf-form varies ; the lamina, borne on a long petiole, may be 
one-, two-, or several-cusped ; the venation is Matonioid of the type Venafio 
Anaxeti. The axis is protostelic, and the leaf trace originates as a single strand, 
as in MertciLsia. It divides in the cortex into two, and undergoes further 
fissions and fusions in its upward course. 

The leaves are dimorphic, the sporophylls being taller and upright, but with 
narrow lamina, marked usually by a strong midrib and enlarged margins. The 
intervening area appears covered by an ' acrostichoid ' soral area. 

Detailed examination shows that the sorus is of the ' mixed ' type with numer- 
ous paraphyses. The sporangia share with those of Dipteris a segmentation 
different from those of any other known Ferns; viz., by cleavage of the primor- 
dium by alternately inclined walls, to produce two rows of segments. Bipartition 
of the lower segments gives four rows of cells of the stalk, which is also a peculiar 
feature common to Dipteris and Cheirophuria. The annulus shows slight 
obliquity, and is not completely interrupted at the insertion of the stalk. 

The vascular supply beneath the sorus shows features which link witji 
I'lutyrcrium. The nerve-endings, which curve downwards to the lower soral 
surface, show enlargement of the distal mass of storage tracheides. Occasionally 
this enlarged receptacular supply may extend from its own definite areola of vena- 
tion, crossing the vein which limits it, into a neighbouring areola. 

This arrangement is a very simple example of what is a regular rule in 
Plcityrerium. Here, in addition to the conducting reticulum of veins of the 
sporophyll, there is a receptacular vascular system, extended in a lower plane. 
This is composed of branches from the conducting system, which may ramify, 
and extend to considerable length. The definite sori are seated upon these recep- 
tacular veins. These and other characters indicate that there is a real relation 
between Cheiropleuria and Plafycerium. The comparative conclusion is this : 
That probably the whole of the Ferns above named sprang from a Gleichenioid 
source. That Matonia is the most primitive of these genera ; Dipteris a more 
advanced type leading to a state with webbed leaves, and a spread of sorus 
over the leaf area. That Cheiropleuria retains the Gleichenioid anatomy, but 
has progressed sorally to an ' acrostichoid ' state. That Plafycerium is another 
derivative of this phylum, anatomically far advanced : it is also advanced 
sorally, though not -to the 'mixed' and 'acrostichoid ' condition seen in Cheiro- 
phuria. Thus Cheirophuria and Platycerium are probably modern Matonioid 
types, and it is possible that certain other living genera will also link on to this 
affinity.

2. Oil Oxidaae Eiizijincs. 
By Professor Alfred J. Ewart, D.Sc, Ph.D. 

Plant oxidases form a class of substances of great importance in plant meta- 
bolism. They are known merely by the reactions they cause, and their exact 
cliemical nature is quite uncertain. According to Bach and Chodat they form 
three distinct classes of ferments, namely : — 

(1) Oxygenases, proteins which absorb molecular oxygen forming peroxides. 

(2) Peroxidases, which increase the oxidising power of peroxides and can 
only act in their presence. 

(3) Katalases, which destroy peroxides with an evolution of oxygen. 

It has long been known that certain of the reactions supposed to characterise 
oxidase ferments could be produced by certain inorganic metallic salts. As the 
result of the detailed investigation of the oxidase action of various metallic 
salts of copper, iron, chromium, manganese, lead, &amp;c., upon guaiacum, para- 
phenylendiamiu, hydroquinone, pyrogallol, gallic acid, tannic acid, and tyrosin, 
the conclusion has been formed that the correspondence between the action of 
organic and of inorganic oxidases is extremely close. It was also fomid 
that in the case of certain salts such as sodium or potassium ferrocyanide, 
ferricyanide, phosiDhate, or chromate, the oxidase action was due to the acid, and 
not to the base. In addition, oxidase action may be accelerated in the presence 
of sensitisers such as the chlorides or phosphates of sodium or potassium, or 
may be retarded or prevented by a variety of anti-oxidases. This applies to 
both organic and inorganic oxidases, and determinations of the minimal 
amounts of metallic oxidases required to produce progressive oxidation in the 
presence of a sensitiser indicate that their action can be considered as closely 
akin to that of an enzyme. 

In general, oxidases, whether inorganic or organic, may vary from strong to 
weak. The strong will cause direct oxidation from the oxygen dissolved in a 
watery solution. The weak will transfer oxygen from labile oxygen com- 
pounds such as hydrogen peroxide, or will use dissolved oxygen in the presence 
of sensitisers isuoh as the chlorides or phosphates of sodium or potassium. 
Various intermediate grades of activity are shown. The oxidase action of a 
metallic salt varies according to its acid combination, and metals such as iron or 
chromium may give salts an oxidase action when the metal is present as base or 
as acid (potassium ferricyanide, bichromate, &amp;c.). There is no reason for 
separating oxidases and peroxidases as distinct classes of ferments, and peroxides 
do not necessarily take part in all oxidase actions. The supposed separation 
of oxidase and peroxidase by fractional precipitation with alcohol may be 
merely the result of attenuation. Metallic oxidases act as ferments in that a 
small amount may produce considerable oxidation, especially in the presence of 
sensitisers (copper sulphate and salt, potassium ferricyanide and sodium phos- 
phate), and that the oxidase appears to act as an intermediary in the chemical 
change. Nitric acid and potassium permanganate, on the other hand, transfer 
oxygen in the first instance from themselves. 

Hydrogen peroxide may influence oxidase action («) by providing a .supply 
of labile oxygen; (b) by converting a feeble oxidase into a strong oxidase (fer- 
rous salt into ferric, ferrocyanide into ferricyanide) ; (c) by acting" as a sensitiser 
to the oxidant substance; (f/) by acting as an anti-oxidase in some cases. Various 
salts may act as sensitisers (sodium and potassium chlorides, bromides, and 
phosphates) or as anti-oxidases (barium chloride, sodium fluoride, organic or 
inorganic acids), and in some cases with increasing concentration the action of 
tlie former is reversed, while a substance which is a sensitiser with one oxidant 
may act as an anti-oxidase with another. This a})plies also to the peroxide of 
hydrogen, and, in the presence of an excess of this substance, an oxidase may 
act as a reducing agent (copper sulphate and salt on indigo carmine). Strong 
metallic poisons will arrest the action of organic oxidases or destroy them 
(apple, potato, carrot, parsnip), if immediate contact or rapid penetration is 
assured. Hence the organic oxidases are possibly proteids with or without 
oxidase metals in basic or acid combination. 

There is no justification for the use of such terms as 'peroxidase,' ' kata- 
lase,' ' cenoxydase,' or ' tyrosinase ' to indicate specific substances, ferments or 

1914. P p 



578 tbansactions of section k. 

groups of ferments. The 'tyrosinase' of the potato is also a ' katalase,' a 
'peroxidase,' a ' i^yrogallase,' a ' hydroquinonase,' and a ' paraphenylendiamin- 
ase.' It is, however, permissible to use such terms as katalase action, peroxidase 
action, and such names as laccase, russulase, jjotatase, carrotase, &amp;c., as tem- 
porary names to indicate the origin of the substances whose chemical nature is 
as yet unknown. Since, however, their oxidase powers will be only one of 
many properties, it will never be advisable to name them according to tliese 
properties alone, any more than it' would be in the case of the metallic oxidases. 
Comparison with metallic oxidases shows that we are not even on safe ground in 
assuming the existence of specifically distinct classes of plant oxidases, such as 
phenolases, aminoxidases, and iodoxidases. The chlorides and phosphates of 
potassiimi and sodium are able to act as oxidase sensitisers, and thus may influ- 
ence special oxidations, or resi^iration in general. It is possible that they may 
exert a stimulatory or controlling action on jjlant metabolism and that the 
sodium chloride always present in the ash of plants may not be an entirely 
useless constituent. This may explain partly why small doses of salt stimulate 
the growth of many plants and why phosphates, in addition to being food sub- 
stances, may act as stimuli to growth. The stimulating action of many metallic 
salts on growth may be partly due to their oxidase action. 

Ursol tartrate turns lignlfied walls red or reddish brown. This is not an 
oxidase reaction, but is an admirable test for lignin, especially valuable for 
demonstrating the wood elements in pulpy tissue. 

Chloroform strongly and ether more feebly retaj'd or inhibit katalase action, 
but they do not suppress oxidase action. After prolonged contact, however, the 
organic oxidases are slowly attenuated and destroyed. 

The liberation of iodine from potassium iodide may be used as a test for the 
presence of oxidases in living tissues, but does not indicate the existence of any 
power of producing peroxides. Dried organic oxidases may retain their pro- 
perties for three weeks or more, and a glycerine extract for five or more months. 

Where organic oxidases are destroyed by boiling this is probably the result 
of proteid coagulation. In spite of previous statements to tlie contrary, (1) 
oxidase enzymes are jDresent in the pulp and rind of the orange and lemon, and 
in the stalks, but not in the bodies, of the endocarpal hairs : (2) oxidase enzymes 
are abundant not in the protoxylem of the carrot, but in the phloem and outer 
cortex. 

The oxidases of the beet and potato appear to be related to one another and 
to be among the strongest plant oxidases. The nearest analogies to them are 
perhaps afforded by ferric salts and ferricyanides. If the special action of apple 
oxidase on tannic acid is due to the presence of a phosphatic sensitiser, it would 
be a feebler oxidase of the same type. Carrot and parsnip oxidases are a grade 
feebler but still react to guaiacum in the absence of a peroxide. Malt diastase 
is still weaker, and papain feebler still, while pepsin may show a weak per- 
oxidase reaction with guaiacum but not any other oxidase action. 



3. Morphology and Anatomy of certain Pseudo-Monocotyledons . 
By Miss E. N. Thomas and A. J. Davey. 

The paper gave a preliminary account of some features of interest which 
have been disclosed in the course of an investigation into the anatomy and 
morphology of the seedlings of geophytic Dicotyledons including some pseudo- 
monocotyledonous forms. The latter have a single cotyledonary member 
terminating in a blade which is more or less bifid in Ranunculus Ficaria and 
Anei7ione apennina, but is luidivided in Conopodium denudatum and Cydanien 
persicum, the ' petiolar ' region being much elongated in Conopodium 
denudatum and Anemone, apennina. 

A tuberous swelling arises while the seedlings are still quite young, before 
there is any sign of a plumule, and in Cyclamen persicum even before the 
cotyledon has emerged from the seed. At an early age the external appearance 
of the seedlings is very misleading, inasmuch as the position of the tuber is 
variously related to the collet, and hence the tuber would seem to occur in 
different morphological regions. The appearance of the plumule at the apex of 



TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION K. 579 

the tuber proves the tuber to be hypocotyledonary in origin, while the collet in 
some forms is situated in the cotyledon. 

The anatomical investigation of Conopodiitvi denudatum reveals the remark- 
able fact that root structure is present tliroughout the whole of the lower half 
of the 'petiole' of the cotyledon, and the same is true of Anemone apennina, 
while in Rnminculiis Ficarin root structure is only found below the cotyledonary 
node. The plane passing through the two poles of the diarch primary root in 
these forms, also passes through the centre of the first plumular leaf, while 
in their normal dicotyledonous relatives, so far as examined (with the exception of 
one individual of Anemone pvUatUla) the diarch plate is at right angles to this 
plane, as in all diarch forms hitherto described. Tliis is of interest in con- 
nection with the plane of formation of the diarch root in the true mono- 
cotyledons. 

4. On thp. Systemaiic Position of Casuarina and its Allies. 
By Emily M. Berridge, D.Sc, F.L.S. 

Since 1891, when Treub discovered chalazogamy in Casuarina, Engler, 
Wettstein, and other botanists have regarded the Amentiferae as primitive 
forms directly descended from certain gymnospermous families. 

The work of many investigators, however, has tended to show that the 
characters on which this view is based are not peculiar to Engler's class 
' Verticillatse,' or even to the Amentiferre generally; and an examination of 
the structure of the inflorescence, flower, and cupule in the Fagaceae seems 
to confirm the view, first brought forward by Hallier (but later discarded 
by him), that the ancestors of the Cupuliferte were allied to the Rosaceae. 



5. Description of some Fossil Fruils. By Bertha Eees. 

Fossil fruits were found in the shaft of the Langi Logan South Gold Mining 
Company at Ararat. They occurred in an old river deposit at a depth of some 
2.36 feet from the surface, and were covered by two distinct basaltic lava flows. 
Many of them are of small size, being about one line in their greatest length, 
rounded in outline, and flattened. Each one appears to consist of two carpels, 
and has what may be the remains of a persistent perianth at the base. 

There are also some fruits of a species of Casuarina and some fruits of 
Eucalyptus, and in addition other remains, such as a bud of a Eucalyptus flower, 
and what appears to be a portion of the rachis of an inflorescence of the same 
genus.

1. Joint Discussion tvilh Section D on the Nature and Origin of 

Species. 

The Origin of Species. By Dr. A. B. Eendle, F.R.S. 

Use of tJie term ' species.' — The unit of the systematist who is required to 
catalogue the plants of various parts of the world as they are discovered. The 
' species ' of the monographer who studies critically an extensive series of 
specimens and recognises ultimate lanits widely differing in degree from well- 
marked species to subdivisions so critical that it requires an expert in the group 
to appreciate them. 

Each species is eminently adapted to its environment; other than slight 
change of form or of arrangement of parts will tend to throw it out of tune 
with its environment, and therefore prove detrimental. To grow plants under 
alien conditions generally requires care and restriction of competition. The 
theory of descent implies a change in the species, and doubtless also in environ- 
ment, but any change unless vei-y slight or gradual would be detrimental. 

On the theory of mutation species have not arisen gradually as the result 
of selection operating for a long period, but discontinuously by sudden small 

p p 2 



580 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K. 

changes or ' mutations,' which are given off in new directions and are inherited ; 
they are distinguished from fluctuating or individual variability in which the 
variations are merely of a plus or minus character and are not inherited. The 
mutation gives rise to a new inheritable specific character, and is the source of 
the so-called elementary species. A comparison of these elementary species 
{e.g., Jordan's Drahas) shows that their distinguishing features are precisely 
those which characterise fluctuating variability — relative size and degree of 
development of parts, hairiness, time of flowering, &amp;c. Each species represents 
the resultant of a number of slight individual variations of already existing 
characters, and suggests some process of selection of a number of slight in- 
dividual variations rather tlian a sudden mutation. A similar remark applies to 
the cases of seasonal dimorphism in alpine meadows described by Wettstein. 

Sports or mutations arising under cultivation are of a different character, 
being generally marked by some one striking character such as cutting of the 
leaf, monophylly in species with compound leaves, &amp;c. Generally speaking, such 
wotdd not persist in Nature, especially where the floral organs were affected, as 
marked changes in these would be detrimental. These afford no evidence as to 
the origin of species in Nature. 

Recently Lot.sy has suggested crossing as the source of new species. Pre- 
sumed stable genotypes or elementary species give rise when crossed to unstable 
heterozygotes which segregate into a new series of genotypes. There is no sug- 
gestion that the new batch of species is more in accord with environment than 
the parents, and there seems no reason for their persistence. In place of slight 
variations of well adapted organisms this theory suggests for the operations of 
Natural Selection an indiscriminate series of new forms. Is there evidence for 
the occurrence of these hybrids or of these series of aberrant and largely 
monstrous forms in Nature in sufficient quantity to account for the origin of 
new species? Direct action of the environment an important factor in the 
origin of species.

]. Relationship of Fungus and Alga in the Lichen-thallus . 
By Miss A. Lorrain Smith. 

General account of lichens and description of the composite thallus. Early 
theories and speculations recalled as to the nature of the different tissues, moie 
particularly in the gelatinous lichens. The green cells determined by Wallroth 
to be brood-cells or ' gonidia,' a theory which was accepted for many years. 
Resemblance of the gonidia to free-growing aerial algse more and more realised. 
Metamorphosis of the alga Nostoc to the lichen Collema finally observed by 
Stahl, who also likened the colourless filaments of the thallus to fungal hyphse. 
An account of the culture experiments by which the alga was successfully 
isolated from the thallus by Speerschneider and observed by him to grow inde- 
pendently and to increase by division. Following the same methods, Famintzin 
and Baranetsky obtained the formation of zoospores in free-growing gonidia. 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K. 581 

Various theories as to origin of gonidia. Culture experiments with lichen 
spores undertaken by Tulasne which seemed to prove that the gonidia were 
directly formed at the tips of the colourless hyphse within the lichen thallus. 
Finally Schwendener's announcement of the dual theory of the lichen thallus : 
that the gonidia were algae of independent origin outside the thallus, and that 
the lichen was therefore a composite plant formed from a fungus more or less 
parasitic on the gonidia or algae. 

Synthetic cultures undertaken by various workers to test Schwendener's 
theory with the result that in time numerous lichen plants were successfully 
developed, up to the fruiting stage, from lichen spores associated with algae. 
Discussion thereafter centred on the exact nature of the association between the 
two organisms : whether parasitism of the fungus on the aljga or a condition of 
mutiial benefit described by Reinke as consortism, by De Bary as symbiosis ? 
Various forms of contact between the two symbionts described and the effect on 
the alga. 

The problem really one of nutrition. The fungus is certainly deiJendent on 
the alga; but the alga is also dependent on the fungus for nitrogen, and to 
some extent for carbohydrates as proved by recent research on the nutrition of 
algas and lichen gonidia in varying conditions. Other instances cited of benefit 
afforded to green plants by associated fungi. 



2. The Cuiilainiiialioii of Drinking ]]'atcr by Algce and its Removal. 
By Professor T. Johnson, B.Sc. 

An account was given of an important supply of water (360 million gallons) 
rendered highly objectionable for domestic use by the presence of a blue-green 
alga, O-^ciUdtoria tenuis var. naUms, which was shown, by dredging, to breed in 
the mud of the reservoir floor. Subsequently the weed floats and causes ' water- 
bloom ' or ' breaking of the meres.' Its accumulation in stored water gives it an 
oily, fishy odour, and also puts the filter-beds out of action. 

One to 10 lb. of copper sulphate per 1,CX30,0(X) gallons removes the nuisance 
without injuring man or fish, as Moore and Kellermann first showed 

The paper illustrated the necessity of supplementing the usual chemical and 
bacteriological examination of water with a biological one. 



Sydney. 
FRIDAY, AUGUST 21. 



After the President had delivered his Address (see p. 560), the following 
Papers were read : — 

1. The Species Concept, with especial reference to Eucalyptus. 

By J. H. Maiden.' 

The paper opened with a statement that the subject, though often debated in 
Europe and America, has been rarely discussed in Australia. The difficulties 
presented by homoplasy were then referred to. The proposition of no fixed line 
of demarcation between species was then discussed, and the writer's use of 
concentric circles to illustrate the affinities of allied species was referred to. 
The difficulties presented by such large genera as Hieracium, Aster, Salix, and 
Rubiis, as well as Eucalyptus, were then emphasised. 

The aid of anatomy and physiology, and indeed other methods, in our quest 
for truly natural species was then discussed. The Jordanian species were 
referred to, and Darwin's dictum was quoted that as regards species our troubles 
come from trying to define the indefinable. Species-making being a form of 
empiricism, there are two camps of honest workers, the ' splitters ' and tlie 
' lumpers,' and the mistakes that are made are the result of existing conditions. 

The writer then explained in detail, as regards Eucalyptus, the plan of his 



582 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K. 

critical revision, pointing' out that no line of study which iJiomised to throw 
light upon the genus had been neglected. He emphasised the point that a 
species must be judged as a whole, and illustrated this by analogies from the 
science of history, from literary criticism, and from industrial legislation, 
pointing out in proportion as a botanist grasps all the facts concerning a 
species, he becomes a broader-minded man. Although endless fun can be poked 
at the illogical positions in which we sometimes find our.selves by our conception 
of species, it is idle to attempt to abandon them, for plants will be labelled 
species on the evidence of our senses to the end of time. 

The writer concluded with a reference to the services of the great European 
herbaria in naming and preserving the types of Australian sjiecies at a time 
w'hen there were no means of preserving such types in Australia herself, and 
entered a plea that as a recrudescence of botanical expeditions to Australia has 
now set in, our colleagues in Europe and America should see that specimens 
of their types are made available in some parts of this continent. 



2. Tlie Correlation helween the Specific Characters of the Tasinanian 
and Australian Eucalypts. By E. T. Baker, F.L.S., and H. G. 
Smith, F.C.S. 

In this paper the authors brought under review the results of their recent 
research on Tasmanian Eucalypts, comparing them with their own earlier work 
on the Eucalypts of the mainland, supplemented by more recent data. The 
ground covered by these investigations, now extending over a period of a quarter 
of a century, embraces almost the whole geographical range of the genus — an area 
of the earth's surface of about 3,000,000 square miles. Such an area includes a 
diversity of soils, climates, altitudes, &amp;c., and naturally one looks for and finds 
a great variety of species, but it is found at the same time that a relative con- 
stancy of specific botanical features and chemical constituents characterises the 
whole genus. 

Comparisons, as well as contrasts, were made between the morphological and 
chemical features of the trees foimd at the sea-level and right up to the highest 
altitudes at which the correlated species occur both in Australia and Tasmania. 

Most interesting results have been the outcome of this work, and a theory is 
now advanced of the geological age of the Tasmanian trees in comparison with 
those of the mainland. It is also attempted to show that in the Tasmanian 
Eucalypts we have the more recently evolved of the whole genus. 



3. Notes on the Evolution of the Genus Eucalyptus. 
By E. H. Cambage, F.L.S. 

A feature of the genus Eucalyptus is its wonderful adaptability to environ- 
ment, and a brief sketch will show some of the changes it has undergone. 

We have fossil evidence of its existence in Australia since late Eocene or 
early Miocene, at which time our present mountain system had not developed, 
and the climate was a mild to warm one. Eastern Australia was then fairly 
level, and in early Eocene was largely composed of siliceous soils, much of the 
silica being in a free state, rendering the soils sandy. Subsequent lava flows 
and deposits of volcanic tuffs yielded a more basic soil, and the final uplift, 
parallel to the east coast, towards the close of the Tertiary, produced elevations 
which have a cold climate. 

Apparently the early Eucalyptus flourished in a sandy soil with a warm 
climate in Northern Australia. The bark was scaly to rough, the leaves 
opposite, sessile, horizontal and generally cordate, and often covered with 
stellate hairs or coated with caoutchouc. The leaves had a transverse vena- 
tion, the numerous lateral veins forming an angle of about 65 degrees with 
the midrib. The flowers were large as compared generally with those of the 
genus at the present day, and possessed anthers which opened longitudinally 
in parallel slits. The fruits were generally larger than those of the more recent 
species to-day, and the chief constituent of the essential oils contained in the 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K. 583 

leaves was pinene. With some alteration in environment, partly climatic and 
partly through the advent of moi'e basic soils resulting from volcanic out- 
pourings, a new development took place in the genus, and species were evolved 
with hard furrowed, fibrous or smooth barks. The mature leaves, which now 
showed a more oblique or diagonal venation, and were alternate, had gradually 
developed petioles, which allowed them to hang vertically, so as to present the 
least possible surface to the sun and thus minimise transpiration, while those 
which remained sessile protected themselves with a glaucous powdery wax or 
with a thickened epidermis. Some species of this new type possessed anthers 
which opened in terminal pores, while cineol became an important constituent of 
the essential oils. As the genus encountered colder conditions, partly through 
spreading southwards and partly through ascending the mountains which were 
uplifted in Eastern Australia towards the close of the Tertiary, a further 
group was evolved having leaves with almost parallel venation, or the lateral 
veins now much reduced in number, at an angle of less than about 25 degrees 
with the midrib, kidney-shaped anthers with the cells divergent at the base 
and confluent at the summit, and essential oils in the leaves containing much 
phellandrene, and little, or in some cases no pinene. By a comparison of 
seedling and mature foliage, evidence of transition in leaf form is found in 
nearly all species, and in the cold-country types, such as Eucalyptus coriacea and 
E. stelluUita, the lateral veins of seedling foliage are arranged at angles up to 
50 deigrees with the midrib, while in mature leaves the angles are less than 
10 degrees, and in most cases the veins are practically parallel with the midrib. 
Eucalyptus leaves with transverse venation are absent from Tasmania, are con- 
fined to a very small portion of North-eastern Victoria and practically 
below the 3,000-foot level in New South Wales, but are common on siliceous 
soils in Northern Australia, thus showing a preference for the warmer climate. 
Eucalyptus leaves with parallel venation occur in Tasmania, Victoria, and 
Eastern New South Wales, while in Northern New South Wales their home is 
above the .3,000-foot level ; and they are absent from Northern and Western 
Australia, but are found at the highest point that any Eucalyptus grows in 
Australia, viz., 0,500 feet, thus showing a preference for cold and moist 
conditions. 



4. Viirutlion and Adnplalion in llic VJiiralijplf.. 
By Dr. Cutiibert HafJj. 

Eucalypts have always been credited with an excessive tendency to varia- 
tion. However, many of the .'jo-called variations should more properly have the 
terms deviations or fluctuation variations of De Vries applied to them. These, 
are responses to physical conditions to which the genus is particularly sensitive. 
Ajiart from these deviations there are many instances where two or more forms 
closely approach each other. Some of these which were classed as varieties 
should now, in the light of fuller knowledge, be counted as distinct species. 
It is wiser to give specific rank wherever possible. Evolution and the pro- 
duition of variations seem to be still actively going on amongst the Eucalypts. 
Instances of variations may be given, among which is one I shall shoitly 
describe — evidence of the cotyledon leaves as to variation and adajitation. In 
the E. corymhosa group these closely re.semblo those of the Angophora'. 
Emargination has had a great influence on the evohition of the cotyledons and 
their adaptation to Australian conditions. This has gone on coincidentally with 
the evolution of other morphological characters and of the essential oils.

The following Papers were read : — 

1. The Vegetation of Goudwaua Laud. 
By Professor A. C. Sewaed, Sc.D., F.R.S. 

The geographical distribution of Permo-Carboniferous plants tliroughout the 
world is a subject on which much has been written in recent years, and evidence 

has been brought forward pointing to the existence of two botanical provinces 

a northern flora illustrated by the coal-bearing strata of North America and 
Europe, and a southern flora obtained from strata in South America, South 
Africa, India, and Australia closely associated with glacial deposits. The object 
of this paper was to institute a general comparison of the vegetation characteristic 
of the two provinces with a view to determine in the light of our present know- 
ledge (i) the degree of difference between the floras, (ii) the bearing of the facts 
on the question of climate, (iii) the relation of the Permo-Carboniferous flora of 
the southern hemisphere to older floras throughout the world. 



2. Beccnt Advance in our Knowledge of Sigillaria. 
By Professor Maegaret Benson, D.Sc. 

After referring to the extraordinary habit of the plants included in this well- 
known genus, and its distribution in time, the author pointed out that the 
fructification of Sigillaria had been hitherto but very imperfectly known. 
Recently a better knowledge of the leaves and cones has been attained. The 
structure of the sporangia was then described and shown to be of exceptional 
interest. 

M. Zeiller was the first to prove from incrustation specimens the general 
habit of the cone and form of the cone scale. Dr. Kidston had since demon- 
strated, also by incrustation specimen, certain characters of the sporange. The 
author has had for ten years some sections of a petrified sporange, but had no 
clue to its identity beyond the fact that it was Lycopodraceous. 

Last year, however, from some ' coal balls ' from Shore, near Manchester, 
sections were cut in the radial and tangential planes of similar sporangia, and 
at once the resemblance to Dr. Kidston's specimens of SUjillarlostrobvs ciliatus 
became apparent. No less than four petrified cones were shortly afterwards 
investigated^ and found to agree in all main features with the Sigillaria cones 
of both Zeiller and Kidston. 

Dr. Kidston's incrustation sporangia had been regarded as being immersed in 
the tissue of the sporophyll. In the new petrified material this appearance was 
shown to be possibly due to the wall of the sporange being carried out as a shovel- 
shaped expansion which exactly fitted into the concave ui^per .surface of the 
sporophyll. The petrified specimens had been provisionally named Mazocarpon, 
or ' loaf -fruit,' from Maze = a barley cake, because of the breadcrumb-like 
appearance of the sterile contained tissue. 

Summary of evidence that Mazocarpon is a fructification of Sigillaria :— 

1. Resemblance to Dr. Kidston's SigiUariostrobi/s ciliatus. 

2. Resemblance of cone axis and bracts to both Zeiller's and Kidston's 
specimens. (The cones are pedunculate, show deciduous cone-scales and cone- 
scars of characteristic form and arrangement.) 

3. Marked association with Sigillaria foliage leaves, and the bark of 
Sigillaria mamillaris. 

The paper was illustrated by lantern slides and models. 



3. Types of Vegetation on the Coast in the Neighbourhood of Adelaide, 
South Australia. By Professor T. G. B. Osborn. 

The region under investigation is a sand-dune fringed strip of coast extend- 
ing in a direction approximately North and South for about eighteen miles from 
Outer Harbour at the northern extremity of Lefevre's Peninsula to Marino, 
where the Cambrian rocks come down to the sea. The area is situated in 



TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION K. 585 

lat. 34° 56' .S. and long. 138= 35' E., being a portion of the eastern shore of Gulf 
St. Vincent. Tlie annual rainfall is about 18 inches, the bulk of which falls in 
the winter month.';, April to September. The summer temperatures may be high, 
not infrequently over KXP F. in the shade. The prevailing winds during the 
summer are S.W. to S., in the winter N.E. to N. 

St. Vincent Gulf is of very recent origin,' and since Pleistocene times the 
coast has undergone several submergences and uplifts. The sand forming the 
dunes has been heaped up along the shores of the gulf against the seaward 
extension of the recent and Tertiary clays forming the Adelaide Plain. These 
clays are exposed by the drifting sand in small patches at the S. of the area. 
The dunes raised by the action of the S. and S.W. winds have been prevented 
from attaining any great height by the action of the strong N. and E. winds 
which blow at certain times. In the shallow waters of the Gulf are large areas 
of Posidonia, Pectenella, and Zostera, the debris of which, cast up by the tide, 
form long banks a foot or more thick and as much as 20 feet across at high- 
tide mark. These banks protect the dunes as well as forming a basis for new 
ones. 

Vegetation. — In connection with the dunes the following communities- may 
be noted : — 

Strand Plants. — Atrlylex cinerea, Salsola l-ali and *Cahile maritima.-' 

Mobile Dunes. — These are colonised chiefly by Sinnifex hirsutus, which has 
.'tout, creeping rhizomes. *A7nmopJuIa arenaria is planted in places, and 
is spontaneous on some mobile areas. The floor of a ' blow out ' is usually first 
colonised by Sal.sola Icali. 

Static. Dunes. — The greater part of the dune fringe may be described as 
static. Spinifex Jiirsutus frequently extends over the seaward face to the level 
of the strand flora. Associated with Spinifex and in part replacing it are many 
shrubs. Of these Olearia axillaris is the most important, but Scarola rrassifolia, 
Ali/xia buxi folia, &amp;c., also occur, and are all able to grow through sand deposited 
on them. Other plants include Pelargonium, au^trale, Lotu.t australis. 
*(Enotliera biennis and Senecio lautu.9. 

Fixed Dunes. — In addition to the plants mentioned above, and other shrubs, 
various Cyperaceous plants {Scirpns, Lepidosperma) and also Dianella occur. The 
radiating prostrate stems of Mesembryanthemum nquilaterale cover much 
ground and serve to bind the sand. Valleys of varying depth and width occur 
between the dunes. In the deeper ones shrubs are common, as above, with 
Leucopogon Birliei, Myoporum serratuni. The ground flora has many herbaceous 
plants and includes several aliens. The shrubby flora is not so characteristic 
of the more open valleys. These are colonised by Me-iemhrj/antlieminn aqui- 
laterale and * (JJnothera biennis. The dunes remote from the sea are occupied by 
an open community of shrubby plants in which Acacia .salicina^ Dodonea viscosa 
appear; Muelilenbechia adpressa, Clematis microphylla are woody climbers. 
Trees of Eucalyptus odorata and Casuarinn quadriralris occur, and there is 
evidence that they were formerly more abundant. 

Marine Salt-marshes. — These are developed on the landward side of the 
dunes in various estuarine areas. 

Mangrove. — The portions subject to tidal scour are colonised by Avicennia 
officinalis. On the shoreward margin this is mingled with Suada maritima. 

Salieornia Stvanij^s. — Salicornia australe and S. arbu.?cula are the most im- 
portant plants over large ai-eas subject to occasional tidal inundation. Brackish 
swamps beyond the tide-limit are characterised by Melaleuca pustulata with 
Salicornias and Franhenia Iccvis, while Mesembryantliemnm, australe also grows 
on better-drained patches. These swamps may pass abruptly into sand-dunes 
or may show zoning, as (1) Salicornia; (2) Salicornia and Samolvs repcns; (3) 
Samolus repens and Sporoholus virginicus; (4) Sporobolus, Spergularia, &amp;c., 
passing to dune flora.

' association,' which it is thought better to avoid in the present preliminary 
communication.

Scrub Woodland. — The tendency to form scrub on settled dunes has heen 
noticed. A woodland of Callitris propinqua formerly characterised much of the 
level area behind the dunes that is slightly raised above the level of the salt 
swamps, but few trees now remain. Under the influence of settlement the 
vegetation is either passing back to that of dunes or is becoming that of grass- 
land, largely composed of Cynodon dactylon, and Sporobohis, with tussocks of 
Xerotes leiicocephala. 



4. On the Xeropliytic Characters of Bossifea scolopendria (Sm.). 

By A. G. Hamilton. 

Bossicea scolopendria is one of a group of leafless species of the genus, and 
is common on the Hawkesbury Sandstone formation in the neighbourhood of 
Sydney, and on the Blue Mountains. 

It is leafless, but seedling plants have small elliptical leaves at first, and in 
very wet seasons leaves grow out on the mature branches in some instances. The 
leaves are set vertically on the branches, and have stomates on both sides, and 
yet the general appearance is that of a dorsi-ventral leaf, the midrib projecting 
on one side, the two halves being at an angle, and the colour differing, the 
side which should be lower being much lighter in colour. 

The branches are flattened and winged, narrow in the lower part, but widen- 
ing upwards to as much as three-quarters of an inch. Tlie epidermis of the 
branches is covered with a network of ridges and, in the hollows between, the 
stomates occur. They are very numerous. The cuticle is fairly thick. The 
palisade tissue is closely packed round the stomates, and absent under the 
ridges. The individual cells are small in diameter and rather short. There is 
no distinct spongy tissue. The vascular system includes large areas occupied by 
sclerenchymatous fibres with thick vv-alls and very small lumina. The whole of 
the tissues contain a good deal of tannin.

6. Tlte Spores of Basiiliomyretes. By J. Burton CriELAKn, M.T). 

This paper presented a study of the spores of various Basidiomycetes found 
growing in Australia. In the systematic classification of sjiecies, the remark- 
able diversity met with as regards the character of the surface and the shape of 
the spores led to speculations as to the importance of these and as to their 
value in showing specific and generic relationships. Though the results are 
inconclusive, the facts are of interest, and seem worthy of still closer investi- 
gation. 

The spores have been considered from the following aspects : — (1) Size; (2) 
Colour in the mass; (.3) Character of the surface; (4) General shape. 

(1) Slzp. — The size of mature spores seems to be sj'ecific within varying limits. 
The dimensions vary in different species from about ?ii in some to 22/t at the 
other extreme (as seen in Australian specimens). Undoubtedly very closely 
allied species may show considerable differences in the dimensions of their spores 
{e.g., StrojjJiaria semiglohata and S. stercoraria). 

(2) Colour in tJie mass. — This has been taken as a basis for the arbitrary 
classification of the Agarics. Though of practical value, it tends to associate 
widely separated genera and to dissociate closely allied ones {e.g., Lepiota and 
Psalliota). Whilst white-spored species are, apparently, most numerous, various 
shades of brown are common. Brown spores are met with in the Agaricacese, 
Polyporaceae, ThelephoracesR, Clavariacese, and Gasteromycetes. Purplish or 
vinous-tinted spores are seen amongst the Agaricaceffi and Thelephoracese. As 
the loss or inhibition of colour is more likely to have taken place in the various 
sub-orders rather than its assumption in each case independently, the basic 
form from which the order sprang probably had coloured spores.

(c) tuberculose. The majority of spores are smooth. Amongst the Agaricaceic, 
whilst occasional genera are principally characterised by echinately warty spores 
(e.;/., Ifussula), in other genera they are rare [e-'j-, OLxasional in hiocybe). In the 
l?olyporace?e occasional species of Boletus show this form; in the Thelephoracea;, 
sometimes in Thi-h'pliora (usually more tuberculose) ; and in the Gasteromycetes 
they are common. The occurrence of peculiar nodulose or tuberculose spores 
in species of Thelepliora, Inocyhe, anH several genera of pink-spored Agarics is 
surely more than a coincidence, indicating almost certainly a common ancestry. 
The paucity of species showing this character suggests its presence being a 
handicap to the maintenance of the species.

7. Potato Scab and its Causes. By Professor T. Johnson, D.Sc. 

An account was given of 'powdery' scab, due to Spongospora suhterranea; 
of black scab, due to Ghrysophlyctis (Synchytrium) e.ndobiotica ; and of some 
experiments to determine to what extent ordinary scab is caused by mechanical 
irritation.

1. Inheritance in certain Giant Races of Primula sinensis.^ 
By E. P. Gregoby, M.A. 

Experiments have been made with two giant races of Primula sinensis, which 
have been shown to be in the tetraploid condition ; that is to say, the plants 
have 4x (48) chromosomes in the somatic cells and 2x (24) chromosomes in the 
gametic cells, whereas in the ordinary (diploid) races of the species the numbers 
are 2x (24) and x (12) respectively. One of these races originated in the course 
of my own experiments from plants obtained in the F2 from a cross between 
two ordinary diploid races; the other giant race consists of the progeny of a 
plant very kindly given me by Messrs. Sutton &amp; Sons. 

The result of most general interest, which has been obtained from these 
experiments, is the discoverj^ that the reduplication of the chromosomes has been 
accompanied by a reduplication of the series of factors. In the pure-bred diploid 
race each factor is represented twice, AA; in the tetraploid race it is repre- 
sented four times, AAAA, and there are three distinct hybrid types, namely, 
AAAa, AAaa, Aaaa. These three hybrid types may, or may not, be identical in 
appearance, according as the presence of a single ' dose ' of the factor is sufficient 
or insufficient for the perfect development of the character in the zygote ; in either 
case they can be recognised by the progeny to which they give rise as a result 
of self-fertilisation. The hybrid AAAa gives no pure recessive types among its 
immediate progeny, but some of its offspring will give pure recessives in subse- 

' A report of this work has been published in the Proc. Boy. Soc., B, 
vol. Ixxxvii., 1914, under the title ' On the Genetics of Tetraploid Plants in 
Primula si7iensis.'

quent generations ; the hybrid AAaa will give, on an average, one pure recessive 
in every sixteen of its offspring; while the hybrid Aaaa will, like the diploid 
hybrid Aa, give one pure recessive in every four plants. 

Ratios of the form 15D : IR, such as are obtained from the hybrid 
AAaa, recall those obtained in respect of certain characters by Nilsson- 
Ehle " in oats and wheat, and by East '' in maize, but in the tetraploid Primulas 
the reduplication affects not merely the factors for isolated characters, but 
extends simultaneously to all the characters which have been studied. The 
numerical consequences of the reduplication of the factors are most conveniently 
studied in cases in which .a single dose of the factor is sufficient for the develop- 
ment of the character, because one thus avoids difficulties of classification intro- 
duced by the occurrence of intermediate forms; characters wliich fulfil this 
condition in the giant Primulas are those of (a) thrum-eye or short-style, as 
contrasted with pin-eye or long-style, and (b) green-stigma, as contrasted with 
red stigma. Crosses between various plants having thrum-eye green-stigma and 
others having pin-eye red-stigma have given the two kinds of hybrid, TTttGGgg 
and TtttGGgg," Avhich have been identified by their progeny. The former gives 
an F2 ratio of 15D : IR in respect of each character ; the latter gives 3T : It and 
15G : Ig. When the hybrids, instead of being self-fertilised, are crossed with the 
recessive, the type TTttGGgg gives offspring in the ratio 3D : IR in respect of 
each character ; while the hybrid TtttGGgg gives equality of thrum-eye and pin- 
eye and 3G : Ig. If the two cbaracters are considered together, a hybrid of the 
type TtttGGgg would, in the absence of special inter-relations between the 
factors, give the curious F2 ratio 45TG : 3Tg : 15tG : Itg ; in the case under dis- 
cussion, however, the results obtained indicate that a complication may be intro- 
duced by the existence of coupling between the factors for thrum-eye and green- 
stigma and further exi&gt;eriment is needed for their elucidation. 

Other characters have been studied, in respect of which the hybrid is more 
or less intermediate between the two pure types. In the case of one character, 
namely, the palmate-leaf as contrasted with the ' fern-leaf,' dominance is com- 
jilete in the diploid races, the hybrid, Pp, being indistinguishable in appearance 
from the pure palmate type, PP ; but in the tetraploid races a series of curious 
intermediates has been obtained, which are probably of the constitution Pppp. 
In other cases where the diploid hybrid is intermediate, the corresponding form 
occurs among the tetraploid hybrids, but, in addition, there also occur peculiar 
intermediate forms, which are confined to the tetraploid races and are quite dis- 
tinct from the diploid hybrid form. In the case of the factor which, in the 
homozygous condition, inhibits the production of colour in the petals, the tetra- 
ploid hybrid, liii, might, so far as appearances go, very well be classed as a 
coloured form ; yet this ostensible recessive is capable of throwing the ' dominant 
white.' 

The results so far obtained do not throw direct light on the problem of the 
possible relationships between factors and chromosomes. The fact that the 
reduplication of the chromosomes has been accompanied by a reduplication of 
the series of factors may, at first sight, suggest a close relation between the 
chromosomes and the factors; but, on the other hand, the tetraploid number of 
chromosomes may be nothing more than an index of the quadruple nature of the 
cell as a whole. There are, however, grounds for hoping that the further study 
of the genetics of the tetraploid plants, especially with reference to the special 
inter-relations between certain factors of which indications have been observed, 
may yield results having a direct bearing in connection with this problem.

2. A Bolaiiical Survey of North-East Neio South Wales. 
By Frederick Turner, F.L.S., F.R.H.S. 

North-East New South Wales, considered from a botanical point of view, 
is one of the most fertile and interesting sections of country on the Australian 
continent. Reference is made to its area, configuration, soil, climate, and rain- 
fall. Its flora, which is described as semi-tropical, being very dense and luxuri- 
ant in places, has occupied the author's attention since early in the 'eighties. A 
greater number of indigenous species of plants are growing there than on any 
other area of similar size in New South Wales. Much of the arboreal vegetation 
is festooned with immense and in many instances beautiful flowering climbing 
plants, and on the trunks and larger branches of some trees epiphytal orchids 
and ferns are growing plentifully, while the ground is literally carpeted with 
many .species of terrestrial ferns. On one gigantic fig tree, Ficuf! mncropJi;/Ua, 
Deaf., more than two hundred epiphytal orchids and ferns have been observed. 
In different parts of this area there are magnificent forests of various .species 
of trees, consisting of both hard and soft woods. The more important of 
the former are the species of Eiicali/ptu-f, and of the latter Cedreln Toonn, 
Ro.xb. Other trees produce valuable, and in some instances highly orna- 
mental, timber, suitable for many industrial puiposes. The rarest and most 
remarkable tree of New South Wales is Htri/chnos fsilospfiiiia, F.v.M., of 
which botanical specimens are e.xhibited. According to Dr. James ]\[. Petrie, 
F.I.C., it yields ulrychvivi', hriicine, and the newly discovered Australian 
alkaloid .itri/clinlrlne. Reference is made to the medicinal value of Duhoisia 
mi/oporoliIt&gt;x. R.Br., and a number of other plants. Mention is made of the 
edible fruit and nut-bearing trees which once furnished food for the aborigines, 
the trees and shrubs with strongly scented bark and leaves, and also those which 
yielded dyes and fibres for the natives. The most conspicuous flowering tree is 
Sferciilia accrifolia, A. Cunn. In the month of December it usually produces 
numerous panicles of rich red flowers, which have a charming and brilliant effect. 
Lccumino^rn are widely distributed and are a conspicuous feature, consisting of 
trees, shrubs, and climbers, producing a profusion of various coloured flowers, 
mostly strikingly beautiful. Several species of Hibiscus produce very large and 
showy flowers, the most remarkable being H. splendens, Fraser. The palms, 
although they only number a few species, sometimes grow into miniature forests 
producing a decidedly tropical effect. Fern trees gTOw abundantly in many 
places, and some attain a considerable height. In the open country the forage 
plants and grasses form a large percentage of the vegetation, and are of great 
economic value. There are heaths of considerable extent which are covered with 
dwarf shrubs and herbaceous plants which produce a singularly beautiful effect 
when in bloom. 

This is the first botanical survey of the North-East, and has added to the 
indigenous plants not previously recorded for New South Wales, twelve genera, 
sixty-nine species, and many new varieties. The number of Phanerogams and 
vascular Cryptogams in the North-East is 743 genera and 1,797 species. 



3. Extra-tropical Forestry in Portugal. By D. E. Hutchins. 

Extra-tropical forestry in Southern Spain and Portugal has a peculiar interest 
for southern extra-tropical Australia, because the climate, the trees, and the 
forestry of both countries are (or will be) the same. Australia is now paying out 
about 3,000,000/. yearly for imported soft wood ; and to produce this at home in 
the future (judging from the experiences of South Africa) Australia will have 
mainly to copy the forestry of Southern Europe. The writer, after a life-time 
in South African forestry, has recently completed a forest tour in Southern 
Spain and Portugal. The chief points of interest for Englishmen are these : — 

The most important forest-tree, and the only abundant forest species in 
Portugal, is the Cluster Pine {Pivus Pinaster), the same tree which (under the 
name of the Maritime Pine) has transformed the dreary malaria-stricken 
' Landes ' of Southern France. It is the Cluster Pine al.so which, on its own 
merits, has become the most abundant coniferous tree in South Africa. The 



590 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K. 

Cluster Pine and the Stone Pine were introduced into South Africa some three 
hundred years ago; and have now become completely naturalised there, in the 
sense that they have taken the place of the weak natural forest flora of the 
country ; and would remain there if the hand of man were withdrawn. 

In the centre of a large pine forest area in Portugal is the State forest of 
Leiria comprising over thirty thousand acres. It has long been worked for timber 
of large dimensions ; and is perhaps the best example of a highly cultivated pine 
forest in the extra-tropics. The temperature here is between that of Sydney and 
Melbourne ; the rainfall is similar except that it falls almost entirely in winter. 
Timber of the finest description is seen in the Leiria forest, as fine as any timber 
in the best forest of central and northern Europe. I measured trees up to 
35 inches diameter and 158 feet total height, and I saw great baulks of timber 
being taken out of the forest, such as one sees in the Black Forest of Germany. 
One usually associates Cluster Pine with pit-props, sleepers, and small timber ; 
but the State Forest of Leiria produces pine timber which is used for every 
puriiose of house-building and furniture. To protect the forest from fire during 
tlie dry summer weather, there is a complete system of fire-paths, watch-towers, 
and telephones. The area of private Cluster Pine forest in Portugal is very 
large. This is mainly occupied in providing mine-props for England. Not much 
resin is produced in either State or private forest in Portugal. 

Cork Oak (Quercus Suber). — After the Cluster Pine the next most valuable 
forest tree in Portugal is the Cork Oak. The Cluster Pine and the Cork Oak 
together enable Portugal to export about l,250,0lX)/. worth of forest produce 
yearly. 

Busaco Cedar [Cupressus lusitanica) has been naturalised in Portugal about 
the same time as the two pines in Soutli Africa. My friend Dr. Henry has 
shown that it came originally from Mexico ; it now produces the most valuable 
timber in the natural forests of Portugal. It should occupy a prominent place 
in any scheme of extra-tropical forestry. It is a most beautiful and valuable 
tree. 

Stone Pine (Pmiis Pinea). — This useful pine with its valuable nuts has suffered 
badly in South Africa from a fungoid disease ; but in Spain and Portugal it is 
nearly free from it. 

Aleppo Pine {Piniis halepensis). — This has certain advantages over Cluster 
Pine. It stands more drought, it will put up with lime in the soil, it transplants 
more easily ; it is somewhat more shade-bearing. It is the species used for 
reforesting the devastated mountains of Southern Spain. 

Oaks. — Five Oaks occur in Southern Portugal. The common British Oak 
(Quercus pedunndata) occurs as copse and scattered trees on good soil. Portugal 
pays heavily for cooperage wood, and wants a great deal more Oak. 

Quercus lusitanica may almost be regarded as the extra-tropical form of the 
British Oak. It should occupy an important part in the future forestry of 
Australia. It has been nearly exterminated in Portugal pre"cisely on account of 
its valuable qualities. 

Quercus Tozza somewhat resembles the Durmast Oak of England ; it is not 
often seen as a large tree, but makes valuable firewood copse. 

Quercus Ilex. — The forest tree-planter in Australia and South Africa will 
generally prefer its first cousin, the Cork Oak; but the Ilex is somewhat hardier 
than the Cork Oak. It is the last tree left on the mountains in Southern Spain 
and Portugal, when fires and the axes and goats of the peasants have produced 
universal desolation. Its chief value lies in acorns for pig-feeding, and there is 
a variety termed Ballota which produces acorns nearly as sweet as a chestnut. 

Chestnut [Castania vesca) seems steadily dying out in Spain and Portugal, as 
in other Mediterranean countries. The threatened loss of this valuable tree is 
one of the saddest features in modern European forestry. It may take a new lease 
of life in the southern hemisphere, care being of course taken (as with Eucalyptus 
in South Africa) to import the tree without its pests. 

The Portuguese forest service is well organised, and the department generally 
far in advance of Britain and the self-governing British Colonies, except South 
Africa. It used to be customary in the forest text-books to place Spain, Portugal, 



TRAKSACTIOKS OF SECTION K. 591 

and the British Empire at the bottom of the list as regards effective State 
forestry. But forestry in Spain and Portugal is now a quarter of a century 
ahead of that of the British Isles ; and many valuable lessons are to be learnt by 
those who can go to Spain and Portugal for the purpose of studying forestry. 
Portugal imports one-third million pounds' worth (against three millions Australia 
and thirty millions Britain) of forest products which, with good forestry, would 
come from the waste lands of each of these three countries. Portugal exports 
about one and a quarter million pounds' worth of forest products — cork, one 
million; Cluster Pine pit-props, &amp;c., one-third million; against Australia one 
million and Britain nothing (the figures shown being re-exportations). Portugal 
and Australia have each a population of over four millions.

Section L.— EDUCATION. 
Pbesident of the Section. — Peopessob J. Perry, LL.D., F.E.S. 



The President delivered the following Address at Sydney on Friday, 
August 21 : — 

I WISH to make some general remarks upon the Science of Education. As in the 
chapter which was entitled ' The Snakes of Iceland,' and which merely consisted 
of the sentence, ' There are no snakes in Iceland,' I might finish this Address 
at once by saying 'There is no science of education.' There is the art or prac- 
tice of teaching or pedagogy, just as there used to be the art of engineering. It 
was only slowly that the subject of Section G, the Science of Engineering, was 
created ; but the subject of Section L, this Section, has still to be created. In 
the creation of a science we first and for long periods have the observation of 
detached phenomena and disputes about them, because the phenomena seem 
complex, having no obvious connection with one another; then experiments 
simplify things, and gradually the science is created by inductive reasoning and 
research. In education^ observation aud disputes have occui^ied much time, and 
we cannot say that the phenomena have become much simplified by such experi- 
ments as have been made. Every man in the street considers that his opinions 
on education are as good as those of anybody else. I suppose that almost 
nobody would refuse to make an after-dinner speech on any kind of education, 
whereas he would not dream of sijieaking about geometry, or chemistry, or 
physics, or physiology unless he had studied these subjects. Any ordinary 
citizen thinks himself fit to be a member of the governing body of a school or 
college, and the disasters due to this belief are worse than what would occur if 
we gave to such men the command of .ships. The ordinary man, especially the 
Parliamentary man, who thinks that the members of a committee on some 
scientific business ought all to be non-scientific men, will jeer at this statement, 
but it is, nevertheless, fatally true. 

It is possible that, even if we had the science, the pedagogues would pay no 
attention to its principles, just as there are industrial chemists in London whose 
businesses are dwindling because they pay no attention to the science of chemistry. 
Pedagogy is in a worse condition than industrial chemistry, because chemical 
products can be easily tested as good or bad, whereas the pedagogic product is 
exceedingly difficult to test. The customer is the worst of judges. Those soul- 
destroying cheap schools described by Mr. Wells used to be very numerous : 
they are still, many of them, in existence. Every observant person knows of 
these places, to which small shopkeepers still send their sons, because they are 
genteel and cheap, and because Latin is taught, and perhaps French. Did any 
such parent ever object to the result of the schooling ? Even when a boy has 
become a man, neither he nor his father knows whether his defects or merits are 
due to bad or good schooling. Please read Mr. Wells' book about Mr. Polly. 
Again, the reforms in. pedagogy which, with Dr. Armstrong, I have been 
clamouring for during the last thirty years, would cause the best-known peda- 
gogues to scrap all their machinery and so to lose nearly the whole of their 
invested capital. Even when they are not influenced by the idea of losing money, 
these men cannot be made to believe in the necessity for reform any more than 
the Central African worshippers of hideous idols can be converted, for with just 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 593 

as much intensity do they worship the product of our present schools and colleges. 
The pedagogue is not alone in his false worship ; this is the day of small men, 
commonplace men, men manufactured like so many buttons, so that it is almost 
impossible for a great man to appear; everybody is compelled by custom or 
by law to go to school, and the school ideal is just as false and mean and 
material as any false religion ever was. Every clever man who has gone to 
a public school and to Oxford or Cambridge worships the system which has 
taken from him his spiritual birthright, his individuality, his initiative, 
his originality, his common sense, his power to think for himself — yes, and 1 
may say his belief in himself. He has become too much like a sheep, ready 
to follow the bell-wether; he is a man who has greatly lost his soul. Average 
boys leaving a public school all speak in the same way, in the same words, 
about anything. They are nearly as much alike as things manufactured by the 
same machine. An expert easily tells from what school a boy has come, because 
there is nothing left in his mind which is not common to ttie whole school. 

The education given in England to boys till they leave school at twenty and 
till they graduate at a University is almost altogether classical : that is founded 
ou the language and literature of Greece and Rome. On the day on which I wrote 
this there was a report of an address in Tlie Tiinrs -which said that this .study 
was the cause ' of all imaginative aspiration.s, of all intellectual interests ' ; ' it 
enabled men to appreciate, not only Homer and ^'irgil, but equally Dante and 
Milton, Goethe, and Wordsworth, all the great thouights of all ages and all lands, 
and to be awake to the movements of their own day.' It said that this study 
made a man 'a better man of business, a better lawyer, a better merchant, abetter 
stockbroker, a less hidebound politician.' ' Those who would banish Greek or 
would make it the peculiar property of a select few did a grave disservice to the 
whole cause of intellectual and spiritual life.' The writer then described his own 
diligent reading in the train every morning; in the course of a few months he had 
read the ' Iliad,' the ' Odyssey,' the ' Aeneid,' five books of Livy, and the whole of 
' Catullus ' and ' Martial.' It seems almost as if he must have all extant classical 
literature off by heart. He must have enormous satisfaction as he sits in the 
train looking at the quite common travellers who are reading about the affairs of 
the nation in English newspapers. I quote the above statements because they 
are typical. All our classical friends say that sort of thing. But I do not pay 
much attention to them, because I know that the greatest classical scholars only 
devote themselves to editing some Greek text that has been edited over and over 
again. These men rave about the glory of youth and beauty as preached by the 
Greeks, but their enthusiasm is not shown in any practical way. We must 
believe that this enthusiasm exists, because these men tell us themselves that 
they experience it. But what is a fair man to say when he hears his friends talk 
of the beauties of Sophocles and Eiu'ipides if he knows that these friends never 
read Shakespeare, or Jane Austen, or Goldsmith, or Dickens '1 I have not 
referred to the fact that classical scholarship leads to power and wealth in the 
Church and State, to palaces and baronies, to purple and fine linen. Leaving 
such tilings out of account, I have a suspicion that this worship of classics is like 
one's fondness for the rhymes, often rubbishy rhymes, that associate themselves 
with our infancy and boyhood, or like Johnson's belief that his wife was amiable 
and beautiful. It is even possible that the very best scholar is of but little use 
to the world. It would be easy to show that, since the sixteenth century, the 
classical pedant has done little but to spoil the rich English language of our 
Bible. We want now a man like Bishojj Pecock to delatinize our language. 

Let us, however, consider a boy of another class — the boy called clever, say, 
one in twenty of the whole. At the age of twenty or twenty-one, stale and 
tired with the reception of ancient learning, of other men's thoughts, he gains 
a fine scholarship at the University, where he is supposed to be almost a free 
man, and all the use he can make of his freedom is to go on absorbing ancient 
learning, keeping his nose to the grindstone as if he were still a schoolboy. 
Treated as a boy from seventeen to twenty-one, he remains a boy till he is twenty- 
four, and he cannot help becoming a small-minded, though clever and learned, 
man, who fails to see that literature is no longer the possession of a small class. 
Yet if he had left school for the University at sixteen or seventeen we might hope 
that University freedom and association with others and with learned men 
might have made him great, a great poet, a man of cultivated imagination, fit

to become a great writer, a great philosopher, a great politician, a ruler of men. 
One of the curses of intellectual England is due to schoolmasters kee^Ding 
men at school and treating them as boys to the age of twenty or twenty-one. 
They take scholarships as stall-fed cattle take prizes at agricultural shows. 

Our famous writers had, like Burns, no school education, or else only a short 
school education. Boys went to the University too early after the Renaissance, 
and Bacon entered Cambridge at the age of thirteen. Shakespeare, thank God, 
was only at a grammar school, and is supposed not to have completed even that 
short course of school work. Even Ben Jonson, w-ho was so proud of his learning 
and rather scorned Shakespeare for his 'small Latin and less Greek,' had only 
a short school education. Phineas Fletcher went to Cambridge at sixteen. 
Massinger went to Oxford at eighteen. Of the school time of some of our most 
original w'riters we have but little information, but that it must have been short 
we have indirect proof. Beaumont's first play was produced at the age of 
twenty-one. Waller entered Parliament and wrote his first poem at eighteen. 
Dryden went to Oxford at seventeen. Milton went to Cambridge at seventeen. 
Addison went to Oxford at fifteen. The whole of Pope's school education was 
four and a half years. Swift went to Dublin University at fifteen. Goldsmith, 
after a most erratic school time, entered Dublin when he was fifteen. Our present 
school system is to keep a boy with his nose to the classics grindstone from the 
age of eleven to the age of twenty, and copies the German system. The result 
is the same in Germany and England. Genius is very common in both countries, 
but 99 per cent, of it is destroyed by the schools. It is, however, when we come 
to study the average boy — nineteen in twenty of all boys — that the system looks 
most devilish. In Germany it is worse than in England. There even the average 
boy submits, and plods hard all the time, because there is a great reward for him 
— a diminution in his time of military service. Well, the result for the average 
German boy is that he becomes stupefied, dull, and loses all initiative. The 
average English boy gets much less of these evil effects, because he neglects his 
schoolroom work and keeps his mind active and his soul alive by means of football 
and cricket. It is from this great characteristic, that knowledge and wisdom come 
from doing and not from abstract reasoning, that the British race rules the world. 
We learn all that induces common sense from observation and experiment. I often 
used to observe that a boy whose face was attractive because of its brightness and 
intelligence in the cricket field, seemed when he entered my classroom as if an 
isolating veil of unintelligence suddenly covered his face. He had settled for 
life that he could not understand the classroom work, and he refused to make any 
more efforts. Even the clever boy's soul is to some extent protected by his sports, 
so that in every way less harm is done in England than in Germany. Still, the 
system produces, even from clever boys, only clever, dull men, fit to be barnacles 
in the public services. The system may be said to give a good training for 
lawyers — ^the necessary clever kind of lawyer of the Law Courts and Chambers 
who is mute in the House of Commons.' But it destroys the higher qualities of 
men and makes them narrow. It ought to be remembered that Lord Somers was 
the only great lawyer who was also a great man. Poor boys cannot get this 

' The acuteness of a lawyer in finding the meaning of a document is very 
wonderful. Almost any mental power can .be cultivated to such a very high 
degree that it almost seems diabolical. A trained person after passing a shop- 
window rapidly is able to describe every object in the window, although the 
objects may be very numerous and curiously different. Yet this same man may 
not be at all clever in other ways. In patent cases a clever judge takes in the 
most elementary scientific knowledge with very great difficulty. The readers of the 
hundreds of newspaper articles of any morning — as like one another as herrings^ 
are awed with their display of culture, of depth of thought, of knowledge, and 
with, what is more astoimding than anything else, an infinitely perfect Oxford 
polish. W^atching the performances of an Oxford man of letters is like watch- 
ing a good billiard player or a skilled musician. His mind is filled with the 
thoughts of other men, pigeonholed ready for use. It is extraordinary that a 
man can have been so educated as to be a good debater, to be able to make a 
fine speech, that he may have taken a degree at Oxford, that he may have passed 
exammations in classics, philosophy, and mathematics, and yet be exceedingly 
ignorant, illogical, and unscientific.

training unless they are so unlucky as to get scholarships, or are indured to 
attend University extensioii lectures ; and it results that nearly all our best 
writers, writers with imagination and originality and initiative and in- 
dividuality, have been boys of the common people. Although poor boys are 
most frightfully handicapped for the race to distinction, I do not think that the 
poor child is much handicapped by mere heredity, for he is naturally nearly equal 
to a boy of the highest lineage. Natural selection up to the time of the first 
great civilisations, when there were comfortable houses and palaces — say, 100,000 
years ago — together with the effects since then of revolutions and wars of con- 
quest, involving slavery of the conquered, have created a wonderful equality 
among the individuals of mixable races. 

For the average boy at a public school the school work is a terrible uphill grind 
all the time ; a soul-destroying, stupefying business, so stupefying that he make.s 
no complaint, he merely suffers. He feels that he is a failure, learning nothing 
that can be of spiritual or material value to him in his future life. Of course, 
he can pass examinations ; anybody can be crammed to pass an examination, 
but after the examination he forgets what he was supposed to have learnt. 

The present system of education is to be condemned for other reasons. It is 
exasperating that all the most important, the most brilliant, the most expensively 
educated people in England, our poets and novelists, our legislators and lawyers, 
our soldiers and sailors, our great manufacturers and merchants, our clergymen 
and schoolmasters, are quite ignorant of natural science; and it may almost be 
said that in spite of these clever ignorant men, and men like them in other coun- 
tries, through the agency of scientific men, all the conditions of civilisation are 
being transformed. I do not think that a fact of this kind would have been 
neglected by the philosophers of Greece (who scorned to know any other language 
than their own) or the learned men of Rome, but when some of us direct attention 
to it and its neglect by modern philosophers we are sneered at as Philistines. It 
is a curious kind of culture which scorns the lessons of history, the study of man 
in his relation to nature, the study of the enormous new forces which are now 
affecting the relations of nations to one another. How many of our rulers know 
the astounding fact that the cost of the most unskilled work done by man costs 
1,000 times as much as when that work is done by a steam-engine? Hence it is 
that the steam-engine has given means for leisure and high culture, yes, and low 
culture and decadence, to hundreds of people instead of units. And the steam- 
engine enables rulers to spend a hundred times as much money on soldiers and 
sailors and ships and munitions of war as they did two hundred years ago. 

The University man thinks that he can get some knowledge of science by read- 
ing, but without laboratory study he is like the man who said ' barley ' when he 
wanted to escape from the robbers' cave and ought to have said ' sesame.' Do 
you know the ballad about Count Arnaldos, who envied the old helmsman his 
weird and wondrous powers ? 

' Would'st thou,' thus the helmsman answered, 

' Learn the secret of the sea ? 
Only those that brave its dangers 

Comprehend its mystery.' 

I know that the ordinary University man thinks, like the wistful Count, that 
he can get all things easily or by mere reading. But, in truth, to read the 
' Origin of Species,' or treatises on astronomy or physics or chemistry, is a mis- 
leading performance unless the reader brings to the study that kind of mind 
which has been developed already by his own observation and experiment. 

The University man, ignorant of science, becomes a ruler of our great nation, 
his duty during war and peace being that of a scientific administrator, and with- 
out turning a hair he fraudulently accepts this important duty for which he is 
utterly unfit. The gods must surely laugh when they see these rulers of ours 
gibing at scientific things, giving important posts to non-scientific men who scorn 
and obstruct the scientific men who are under their orders. If Oxford scholars 
were merely like so many monks in their monastery, living the lives and following 
the studies which they love, I would say nothing. The revenues so used up are, 
I think, of no great importance to the country, and bu.sy men elsewhere can only 
be benefited in knowing that at Oxford and Cambridge there are these lovely 
lama-series where men are living in serene air apart from the struggles of the

world, living what they think to be the higher kind of life, that of the amateur 
copying the lives of the scholars of Constantinople before they were so mercifully 
scattered in 1453, copying the meditative ways of the divines and hermits of the 
fourth and fifth centuries. Unfortunately the Oxford hermits have by a series 
of accidents become the rulers of the greatest empire that the earth has ever 
seen, and it is very obvious indeed through many other things than the starting 
of South African wars that they are uniit for their job. 

If our rulers were like savage chiefs they might possibly give equal chances to 
candidates for posts ; but unfortunately it is as if our leaders possessed great 
negative knowledge of Natural Science, and as if a man's chances of being 
appointed to a scientific post or of having his advice listened to were in inverse 
proportion to his scientific qualifications. Scientific men look around them and 
see that everything is wrong in the present arrangements, but they also see that 
it is useless to give advice which cannot be understood by our rulers. And, 
indeed, I may say that when by accident a scientific man is appointed on a 
committee there is a negative inducement for him to do anything. 

Many men enter the services by examination, and it is always througli 
cramming that they pass. In some cases the examination is supposed to be in 
science. In truth, the scientific habit of thought, the real study of science, 
the very fitness of a boy for entrance to the service, would unfit him for 
passing these abominable unscientific examinations. For some army posts, 
further scientific food is provided by the Government for the classical or modern 
language or science dummies after they enter the service. If one wishes to hear 
how evil this system of pretended education is, let him ask the opinion of some 
of the professors who are condemned to help in carrying it out. The whole 
system is foolishness from top to bottom, and the men prepared by the system 
cannot see how abominable it is, even when they are afterwards trying to 
improve it; well mannered mediocrity is everywhere successful and reproduces 
itself. 

I have been dwelling upon the consequences of letting aristocratic University 
men who are to be rulers of the country have an education which involves no 
study of natural science. Besides these men we have a larger number of middle- 
class men who will succeed their fathers in the management, not merely of landed 
estates, but of much more valuable estates in the manufacture and distribution of 
things. With them there is the same contempt for books, for learning, and the 
same absence, not merely of knowledge and of natural science, but of those 
scientific habits of thought and methods of approaching problems which experi- 
mental research tends to produce. These men become the owners of factories the 
spirit of which ought to be scientific research ; the competing factories in Ger- 
many, France, and America are run by men of scientific method, but our owners 
discourage reform in every possible way. The rule of thumb of their fathers and 
grandfathers is good enough for them. Their factories are so badly arranged 
that the works cost of any manufacture is twice what it ought to be and the time 
taken is twice as great. They take eagerly to all sorts of quack remedies for bad 
trade; they are the easy victims of fraudulent persons. These are the men who 
discourage all education in the people employed by them, managers, foremen, and 
workmen. They are what I call unskilled workmen— that is, unskilled owners of 
works — and it is the University and the whole system of their education which is 
to blame for their unskilfulness. It is astounding how quickly unskilled owners 
of works are being eliminated, but there is a new crop of them every year. 
The want of education of these men is very harmful to the country. 

But I get too angry when I think of what our Universities might do in the 
great world of natural science and of the futility of almost all their studies. And 
this anger is greater when I think that the Universities rule the schools. The 
general higher education of the community is being altogether neglected, the 
general culture of professional men is being neglected; and in the case of pro- 
fessions involving applications of physical science, useless obligatory subjects 
are insisted upon, so that for these professions the University is a harmful 
institution. Medical students have so much hard work in various kinds of 
grammar subjects required for matriculation that they must be forgiven for their 
utter ignorance of natural science. But an outside Philistine may also be forgiven 
when he suggests that the whole country might benefit if the school training of 
medical students put them more in sympathy with scientific discovery. It is a 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS, 597 

well known fact that there are medical men in lucrative practice, said to have 
the highest University qualifications, who tell you frankly that they do not 
believe in bacteriology ! 

A great many young men from tlie secondary schools are now entering the 
engineering profession. By engineering I mean any kind of applied physical 
science. Every important town in Great Britain has established at least one 
great technical college at large cost in building and apparatus, with stafi's 
of professors and teachers (always badly paid), and it is found that for 
their first two years the students liave to be kept at great cost to the country 
learning those simple principles of science which they ought to have learnt at 
school. It is found that they are not only ignorant, but they have none of the 
habits of thought and scientific method which school laboratory work induces. 
The clever ones, if they leave school at seventeen, recover from the effects of a 
school education which prepared men only for being lawyers or clergymen ; but the 
average man finds that he has been prepared only to be a hewer of wood and a 
drawer of water to the real engineer. It is found in most cases that the success- 
ful students are those who have attended primary schools where no boy is com- 
pelled to learn any language other than English, and where every boy does 
laboratory work in mathematics and natural science. There can be no doubt that 
poor boys have now an enormous advantage over the sons of rich men, for even 
when the fees of the dav classes are large the evening class fees are small, and 
the poor boys attending "the latter are getting to be very fit for higher study in 
natural science. 

The English school system has outlived the mediaeval conditions which pro- 
duced it. In old days the only way to knowledge was through Latin : all 
writing was in Latin. The result then was pretty much what it is now ; lawyers, 
clergymen, and schoolmasters had to know some Latin after school life j the 
average man forgot anything he had learnt. A few very clever men did read, 
but the average monk or priest was a very ignorant person. 

English people know the worthlessness of the public school system in the 
mental training of the average boy. Why, then, do they submit to it? However 
conservative they may be, they would not submit to this worthless system merely 
because it is hallowed by a history of 500 years. 

The fact is, this worthless system continues because in some occult way it 
seems to have a connection with something of real importance, public school form. 
There is really no connection. When, in my youth, I was a master at one of the 
great English public schools, like everybody else I was a frightful prig in 
regard to public school form. Eton form or Harrow form or Eugby form or 
Clifton form was the thing at each of these schools which was thought to be of 
more value than anything else in the world. Dr. Arnold, of Eugby, taught the 
trick of manufacturing it. It is in itself a splendid thing. The public school 
boy is trained in self-possession, modesty, cleanliness, truthfulness, and courage. 
At school his health in body and morals is all important. He learns to lead and 
also to obey. But the average resulting man is exceedingly ignorant ; he neither 
reads nor writes, and he has little reasoning power except what his sports have 
developed. This form is essentially aristocratic. It is based on superiority of 
position or birth or caste. A man's place is fixed, his attitude to people of 
higher or lower rank is fixed. He needs no self-assertion, and he cannot become 
a ' bounder,' that is, a ' cad ' ; but in Thackeray's sense he is usually a ' snob,' 
and in various directions he may be a [irifj. By prig, I mean a man who cannot 
get outside convention and so cannot exercise his own common sense. One 
defect is that public school form when combined with poverty cannot 
make much money by its own ability, and if it does not starve it must 
join the valets or the grooms. Its strength lies in convention and 
habit and the belief that poor people are not men but a lower kind of 
animal who may be pitied as we pity a suffering dog. Such pity can never 
raise the people or reform abuses. In the middle ages young gentlemen of 
England had the same sort of education. It was probably best in Plantagenet 
times, when indeed a well trained young gentleman was not only very healthy and 
courageous, but he had not much chance of becoming lazy. A man was proud of 
his heavy armour, and he was trained to act vigorously when carrying it. They 
were chivalrous to each other, but, alas ! to people outside their own class they 



598 TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION L. 

were cruel. The Black Prince is typical ; think of his courtesy to King John of 
France, and then think of his destruction of the persons and property of all the 
peasantry in those large regions of France which he covered with his marauding 
soldiers. This kind of chivalry, which is never exhibited to a lower class than 
one's own, has its beauty, but it does not suit a democracy; it requires that there 
should be a lower class than its own. The Spartans needed their helots. The 
Southern planter in America had fine manners, but he could not have cultivated 
them if there had been no slaves and mean whites. It is a well-known fact that 
some year.s before the Civil War in America it was seriously proposed by 
prominent Southerners to make slaves of the 'mean,' that is, the poor whites. 
The chivalrous Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun showed but little knowledge of his 
countrymen when he formed his plan for reducing a large part of the workin,g 
classes of Scotland to slavery. Public school form may sit not unhandsomely 
upon country gentlemen or any rich men who have many servants or tenants or 
other dependents, but it does not sit at all well ujoon poorer men, for it puts them 
out of sympathy with people among whom they must work. It is heartbreaking 
when associated with the poverty of a man looking for work in places where he 
has no influential friends, as it is nearly always associated with illiteracy and want 
of wisdom, with helplessness and with disinclination to learn. Nobody doubts 
that a modern country gentleman is much more polished than Squire Western or 
Squire Limipkiu, but he has much the same opinions and forms them in the same 
way. The manners of a young officer are certainly superior to those of Ensign 
Northerton, but he is in much the same state of ignorance.' 

We ask the schools for mental power as of old one asked for bread, and they 
give us a stone. No doubt public school form is a beautiful stone, a diamond ; 
but we want some bread as well, even if it were only in the Falstaffian proportion 
of bread to sack. For my part I do not see why the average boy at school 
should not have reasoning power and a love for reading and knowledge as well as 
good manners, and this is why I ask for a great reform in our schools. We want 
from the school what Nature has not been accustomed to give, and what home 
life cannot give, the development of the intellect, and the school fails to give it 
in ninety-five out of every 100 cases. The great danger in school life is that 
it may hurt individuality, originality, because a boy, however harum-scarum is 
naturally conventional and imitative. Good form comes easily therefore, and the 
master is more than satisfied, he is proud. He often speaks of it as character, 
but he is quite wrong. Character comes from home life, not from school life, 
which indeed is rather antagonistic to character. It comes from contact with 
fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, relations and friends. School life 
tends to induce a contempt for the lower classes and a slavish admiration of 

' The Report of the Commission on the Education and Training of 
Officers of the Army (1902) is well worth study. Dr. Maguire, the most ex- 
perienced coach, said, as a witness : — ' Latin, as taught to the average schoolboy, 
is pure waste of time, and does not develop intelligence or tend to breadth 
of culture in the least or facilitate the acquisition of modern languages.' . . . 
' The prominence of ancient classics in English schools and the large proportion 
of youthful years devoted to failure in regard to them explain the stupidity 
and incapacity of their pupils as compared with the same class of persons in 
other advanced communities.' . . . ' They [classics] are kept in such vogue to 
suit the convenience of languid schoolmasters Avho can teach nothing else, and 
for no other reason whatever.' He spoke of ' the absurd anachronism of lazy 
and costly schools, which rendered so many of us ignorant of the very subjects 
which are generally useful and interesting.' He said : ' but our educational 
system all round is utter folly at best.' Speaking of English Universities, 
'the whole system is a grievous absurdity.' ' " Society " and snobbery are the 
curses of England.' 

This address was delivered in Australia when we had been at war with

much of it unsaid. In this page I have deleted a long paragraph concerning 
young English officers.

the upper classes, which is altogether wrong in a democracy, and can only lead 
to evil. 

It always happens that the real education of the average man begins when he 
falls in love and sees the necessity for writing love letters. He must have spent 
many years of worry at school and passed examinations in Latin and mathematics, 
perhaps in French or German, in geography, and many other subjects, all taught 
in water-tight compartments, yet he is quite illiterate. If he has been slightly 
higher than the average boy he is able occasionally in after life to quote one or two 
tags from the Latin grammar and to say that he thought he remembered some- 
thing of the jiovs asinorum; he is also fond of using the expression 'the unknown 
quantity x,' because it shows that he once worked at algebra. A Premier of Great 
Britain who had sent out a great military expedition to Cape Breton expressed 
great delight afterwards when he suddenly discovered that Cape Breton was an 
island. Chancellors of the Exchequer have shown themselves to be quite ignorant 
of the simplest arithmetic. A very successful Cambridge coach told me that 
it is quite common for the father of a pupil to tell him that he does not wish his 
son to get a good degree. Generalisation is always dangerous, but I think I am 
safe in saying that Englishmen of the higher classes do not believe in education. 
They believe in what they call character, which always to them means public 
school form, and they believe in mental mediocrity, which in most cases means 
mental inferiority. This gives one explanation of the persistence of the public 
school system. The man who remembers his years of dull school classroom 
routine with no intellectual result is not likely to be enthusiastic over the 
education of his son. 

Unfortunately all secondary schools try to copy the public schools. They 
also aim at teaching good form, mainly by magnifying the importance of football 
and cricket. To differentiate themselves from the primary schools, they compel 
every boy to learn through Latin. And all this they do at a rate which suits 
the pockets of the lower middle-class parent. It is a poor imitation of a system 
only one part of which is worthy of imitation. 

I can understand why Tom Sawyer and his friends, when they started their 
gang of robbers, initiated them through passwords and a ritual. That was for 
'side.' The gang did not consist of pirates or robbers; they were innocent 
young boys, and their passwords and ritual were the essence of the romance of 
the thing. Latin for the average youth seems to me to be merely grown-up Tom 
Sawyerism, and is allied in obvious ways to the worship of Mumho-Jumbo. It 
nsed to be that the use of fur on clothes was reserved for the higher classes. At 
another time gentlemen only were allowed to wear swords. In China and Japan 
certain buttons and coloured dresses indicated certain rank. In our own time 
there are fashions of slang which distinguish the smart set of society. The 
survival of Latin and Greek is very much the same sort of thing. It has no 
more to do with education than the two hind buttons of our coats or the wigs of 
our judges have to do with convenience. Tlie classics ride us like Sindbad's old 
man of the sea. All over the British Empire a well-educated man cannot become 
a professional man of almost any kind imless he pretends to know something of 
one or more dead languages, such knowledge being of no essential value to him. 
It is something like what the old Test Act imposed upon lis ; for 130 years a 
British citizen perfectly competent to fill the highest posts could not take upon 
himself the smallest kind of public work unless he could swear to a certain 
formula. Most of the numerous students of a very important School of Mines 
refuse to take their B.Sc. degrees because they are wise enough to refuse to learn 
Latin. The mine-owners are wise enough to engage these men if they possess 
only the college diploma, although they have no degree. There is hardly one 
mining engineer holding a University degree in the country that I speak of. 
Indeed, I may say that only a few mining engineers in Great Britain hold a 
University degree, and this is for the same reason. 

If there is any particularly useless, poor, genteel clerk you will find that hig 
son must be taught Latin. If there is any little township in a new country 
where everybody is ignorant, the schoolmaster must teach Latin. Any cheap 
schoolmaster, knowing nothing, worth nothing, will, you may be sure, say 
that he can teach Latin. If there is a particularly illiterate bar-room loafer in 
the town who never reads books or newspapers you will find that he has a stock- 
in-trade of perhaps three Latin phrases which keep him provided in beer.

Do you know why Portia the Maid of Belmont remained so long unmarried ? 
It was because her suitors assumed that the golden language of conquest was 
Greek and the silver language was Latin. If you read between the lines you 
will see that this is what Shakespeare meant. His leaden casket signified the 
English of Belmont-cum-Stratford-on-Avon. 

The worst of it is that the average boy who has done almost nothing else 
than Latin and Greek at school gets absolutely no love for the classics ; he never 
reads a Greek or Latin author after he leaves school. He might enjoy them in 
translations, but he hates their names, and even if he did not it would never 
enter his head to read a 'crib.' Surely this is the natural effect of the school- 
room routine. 

Following that article in The Times newspaper, referred to above, in a 
discussion, the secretary of the Association for Improving the Teaching of Latin 
said, ' Out of the vast number of boys who learned Latin only a few reached 
the stage when they could read the classics with any pleasure. A still smaller 
minority continued their classics after they had left school or the University. 
The great majority left school with very little, if anything, as the result of years 
spent in the study of the classics.' The next speaker said that the reforms 
suggested ' were based upon the assumption that the present method of classical 
education was wholly bad. He did not agree.' Nor do I agree. I think that 
if there is one subject that the ordinary public schoolmaster can teach it is 
Latin. I take the first statement as right, however. I have always said so, 
loudly, to an unbelieving world that thought me prejudiced, and here we see a 
lover of the classics inadvertently supporting me, and surely every fair-minded 
schoolmaster must agree with him. at all events as concerning the average boy. 
It is not the method of teaching that is wrong: it is merely that Latin as a 
school subject for the average boy must be altogether condemned. It takes from 
him all interest in every kind of literature; it makes him dislike reading. We 
must have some compulsory subjects, and I think that any boy may be taught 
any subject — to some extent; but we ought to have as few of these compulsory 
subjects as possible, because any subject may be found very difficult bj* certain 
classes of intelligent minds. And it is .surely ludicrous when a clever mathema- 
tician, well read in Natural Science and fond of English literature, is plucked 
for his degree because of his poor Latin or Greek. I knew a case where the first 
classic of his year would have failed to pass his 'Little-go' only that speci:il 
arrangements were made to let him through his mathematics easily. ]\Iy own 
career was nearly ruined because I failed in a French examination. 

Before a student enters a University he ban to pass a Matriculation examina- 
tion, so that we may be sure that he is fit to follow any of the courses of study. In 
mediiTeval times the one compulsory subject was Latin, because all the literature 
known to students and teachers was in Latin, all lectures were delivered 
in Latin, all teaching was in Latin. Consequently in some Oxford Colleges a man 
was fined if he spoke in any other tongue. Then came the time when there was 
still no English literature, and not only was the best literature in Greek, but Greek 
was the only approach to natural knowledge, so Greek also was compulsory, and 
so it has remained to this day — to this day when English literature (includin;g 
translations) is of greater worth than any ancient or, indeed, any other modern 
literature ; when all teaching, all lectures are given in English, and when our 
Englisli knowledge of Natural Science is not only infinitely greater than anything 
possessed by the ancients ; but it enables us to say that the ancients were hope- 
lessly wrong; when nobody but the official University orator or some traveller 
ignorant of the language of a foreign country speaks Latin and then speaks 
rather the language of Stratford-atte-Bow than the Latin of the City of the 
Golden Shields" The men of the City of the Violet Crown were not handicapped 
by being compelled to learn any other language than their own, to waste their 
time on mere words; 'they were engaged in pursuits of a higher nature, in 
acquiring a knowledge of things. They did not, like us, spend seven or ten 
years of scholastic labour in making a general acquaintance with two dead 
languages. These years were employed in the study of nature and in gaining 
the elements of philosophical knowledge from her original economy and laws.' 
The above quotation is from the Langhornes' ' Life of Plutarch,' and it is par- 
ticularly valuable as expressing the views of two great classical scholars. 

I would make a knowledge of Latin or of Greek compulsory only on student^

of certain subjects, and the professor ought to impose the condition, not the 
University. Again, students of certain other subjects ought to know one or more 
foreign languages, and, indeed, it seems to me that the professor in each subject 
has a right to insist on his students ha^^ng certain special knowledge 'before 
they enter upon a study with him. But to enter the University, surely the com- 
pulsory subjects ought to be as few as possible. It seems to me that the most 
important thing is to make sure that every student has had an early education 
through his own language— English ; that he should be able to write an account 
in English of anything he has seen; should have some acquaintance with what 
are called English subjects, such as geography and history, and the principles 
of natural science, and the power to make simple computations. All the teach- 
ing is to be in English, all his companions speak English; there are good English 
books on all subjects, there are English translations of all the good books "that 
have been written in foreign languages. So abominable do I think compuhori/ 
Latin or Greek or French or German that I believe a primary school to be a much 
betterschool than any other for a boy if he is fitting himself for any profession 
in which applied science is important. At present English is not tauo-ht pro- 
perly in any British school. The teachers are all classical men, who are very 
careful when they write Greek or Latin and exceedingly careless and slipshod 
when they write English. We might easily write a fairy story about three sisters 
—Greek, Latin, and English— and call it 'Cinderella.' The language of the 
greatest empire known in history, the empire of the English-speaking peoples, 
IS not taught seriously in any part of that great empire. It is shocking to get 
from a great classical scholar a letter with misspelt words on every page, every 
sentence being ungrammatical. When will our good modern writers tell us how 
English composition may be taught to ordinary folk? 

I want you to understand that we have established some fundamental prin- 
ciples in our science : (1) A subject must interest a pupil. (2) A man who trains 
dogs or seals or bears or other animals makes a close study of their minds. In 
the same way we must recognise that one boy differs from another, and study 
the mind of each boy. (3) If a boy is not very receptive of an important subject 
we must do our best with him and try to settle what is the minimum with which 
we ought to be satisfied. Only a few subjects ought to be compulsory on all 
boys. (4) Tliere are two classes of boys unequal as to numbers, (a) those fond 
of, and (h) those not capable of, abstract reasoning. (5) Another two classes are 
{f) those fond of, and {b) those not fond of, language .study. (6) Every boy may 
be made to^ write and read in his own language and he may be made fond of 
reading. (7) The average boy's reasoning faculties are most surely developed 
by letting him do things. That is, for example, through his sports' or through 
wood or metal working, or gardening, or experiments involving weighing and 
measuring._ Through the last of these he learns to compute. A boy of^ight 
learns decimals in an hour if he weighs and measures, whereas by" the u.sual 
method of teaching he is ignorant of decimals at the age of fourteen. A bny 
learns whist very quickly if you seat him with three other people at a table with 
a pack of cards; he would not learn in a month if he had no cards. Would you 
teach a boy to swim by mere talk ? (8) Every boy must get a good deal of 
persona] attention. (9) However good a system may be there can be no good 
results if the teachers are cheap ; cheap teachers are usually stupid and over- 
worked. Men in charge of schools and colleges never seem to learn this. The 
market price must be paid for a capable man. (10) Fairly good results may be 
expected from a good teacher, even when he is compelled to work on a bad 
system, but really good results can be obtainable only from a good teacher with 
a good system. 

I need not go into details about all these principles, but I should like to 
dwell presently upon a few of them. At the beginning of this Address I, spoke 
of the obstruction to great necessary reform— too much antiquated machinery to 
'scrap.' Most schoolmasters will admit the necessity for reform in the case of 
the average boy, but they say that parents are opposed to the reform. Unbelief 
in education for the average man is so general among the higher classes that I 
am afraid we shall have no reform unless some great national disaster causes 
conversion. There is a lesson for England, and, indeed, for all European races, 
in the recent history of Japan. The old structure of Japan was in many ways 
beautiful, but it proved to be without physical strength. Its extreme weakness 



G02 TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION L. 

proved its salvation. Even the teachers of ancient classics saw that for strength 
it Avas necessary to let scientific method permeate the thought of the whole 
population. And now, at the end of the first chapter of Japan's modern history, 
we find a nation which can not only defend itself, but which retains all of its 
spiritual life which was beautiful. Every unit of the population can not only 
read and write, but it is fond of reading, and its education did not cease when 
it left school. It is getting an increased love for Natural Science, so that it can 
reason clearly ; it is not carried away by charlatans ; it retains its individuality. 
One result of this is that in time of war Japan has scientific armies. Not only 
are its admirals and generals scientific, but also every officer, every private is 
scientific. Everything in the whole country is being developed scientifically, 
and we Europeans, hag-ridden by pedantry in our schools and universities, refuse 
to learn an easy lesson. At present we do not even a.sk what is meant by educa- 
tion or what education is necessary if a particular boy is to be fitted for his life's 
work. In 1902, when I was President of Section G, and in opening a discussion 
on the teaching of mechanics at Johannesburg in 1905, I gave my views as to the 
teaching of a young engineer, but they apply also to the teaching of nearly all 
boys. These views have been commended by experienced engineers and teachers. 
To understand me it is first necessary to try to cast away prejudices, and this is 
especially difficult if one has a pecuniary interest in education. The student of 
almost any other science than education cares for nothing but the truth ; even 
when he has committed himself to a theory and his good name or credit is at 
stake the rule of the game is perfectly well known and must be adhered to. The 
student must not neglect fact or pervert fact ; he must be quite fair. The 
student of physical science sees at once whether or not he is playing the game, 
because the co-ordinates are few; there are no complexities, such as we find in 
our own life problems. This also is why the study of physical science is so good 
in causing boys to reason, for reasoning can only be taught by constant practice 
on simple matters which one thoroughly comprehends. Consider a boy's views 
about ordinary affairs. He is downright. A complex thing must be greatly 
simplified to him. His painting is in black-and-white; there is no delicate 
shading in his picture. He never sits on the fence; he is never a trimmer. An 
historical character is awfully good or awfully bad, very clever or very stupid. 
A boy is, in fact, cocksure about everything. He is incapable of reasoning about 
complex things. And when we try to teach him to reason about simple things 
we must be quite sure that they really are simple to him, that he understands 
them. For example, many educationists say that the study of geometry is just 
right for a boy. Well, yes, for five per cent, of all boys, boys who can take in 
abstract ideas. They take to Euclid as a duck takes to water. But for the other 
ninety-five per cent, geometry is very hurtful, because unless they continually 
experiment with rulers and compasses they do not understand what the reason- 
ing is about. In ancient times only very old and exceptionally clever men were 
allowed to study geometry. We now assume that it ought to be an easy study 
for the average Englisli boy. Genei'ation after generation we stupefy the average 
English boy with demonstrative geometry, and we call him a duffer so often that 
he thinks himself a duffer, and even his mother thinks him a duffer, and, indeed, 
we have done our best with geometry and Latin to make him a duffer. Only 
for his football and cricket, which teach him to reason a little, he would hecome 
a duffer. And yet in my opinion if this average boy were properly taught in 
school he would prove to be very superior to the boy who is usually called clever 
The schoolmaster calls a boy clever because he is exactly like what the school- 
master himself was when a boy; but I am afraid that I place little value on the 
schoolmaster's cleverness, whether as a boy or a man. Reasoning can be taught 
through almost anything that a boy does, but more than all things through his 
experiments in Natural Science. Formal lessons on reasoning, on logic, are 
utterly useless, and I may say that set lessons on almost any subject are utterly 
useless for the average boy. 

Milton's poems are greatly praised. Well, I am not .going to say a word 
against the people who talk in public about the most "wonderful epic 
in our language and who never read it ; but how many people have read 
Milton's magnificent prose works? Milton fir.tit taught me the true notion of 
education, that the greatest mistake is in teaching subjects in watertight com- 
partments. It is the idea underlying one of the most instructive books ever 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 603 

written, ' Sandfoid and Merton.' When teaching a subject, teach all sorts of 
other subjects as well. If Mr. Barlow's boys were interested in astronomy he 
showed them stars and planets through a telescope for a night or two, but he 
gave them no stupefying course on astronomy. He gave them stars and the solar 
system just as long as they were interested. He used a globe as well as mere 
maps in teaching them geography and history, but the soul-destroying idea of a 
coui'se of study on ' the use of the globes ' did not commend itself to him. 
They walked over the fields and took an interest in trees and flowers, but he 
gave them no stupefying course on botany. When he gave them a lesson on 
English grammar or literature he taught them at the same time the geography 
and history and the fairy stories of their country. How can a man give a 
course on grammar or geography or history or anything else without diverting 
his talk in an interesting way to other subjects? What is so tremendously 
important about Natural Science laboratory work is that a student must be 
thinking all the time about the same matters, not from one "but from ten interest- 
ing points of view. He is not merely observing, he is measuring, he is comput- 
ing, he is reasoning; he has to write out descriptions of what he sees and does, 
and he thinks then of his spelling and grammar; he has to sketch; he has to 
read books about what other people have done before him on the same subject, 
and also for statistics. He learns the value of a bit of work done in a clean 
honest way, and when he gets some more experience he glows with the feeling 
that he has really added to the knowledge of the world. He is a discoverer, 
and he feels the emotion of Cortez ! It is marvellous the alteration which 
has occurred in the mental attitude of the common average boy. Instead of 
feeling that he is a degraded slave he feels the emotion of his childhood 
returning to him. He once made the great discovery at the age of six that the 
back garden was inhabited by fairies and lions and Indians and pirates. He 
was the Caliph Haroun Alraschid for a while. And now, after a wretched 
life at Latin and Euclid, a new revelation is vouchsafed to him, and as he gathers 
years he finds that Nature is placidly willing to let him steal her secrets little by 
little, one by one, secrets that are gradually changing men from the bewilderment 
and spirit possession of the Middle Ages; so that at length he enters into com- 
plete communion with Nature and rollicks with her, and quarrels with her, and 
loves her more and more until he dies. And his reasoning power has been grow- 
ing all the time, so that more and more he understands complex things, for, 
after an experimental study of story-books, he probably entered the kingdom of 
Shakespeare at the age of fourteen. Things requiring memory can be learnt only 
in early life — weights and measures, the multiplication table, languages. He 
knows games involving spelling. But, over and above all these, he has from 
infancy repeated all sorts of poetry long before he could enjoy much more of it 
than the jingle of its rhyme. 

Education consists in the development of a man from his earliest day, and 
does not cease till he dies. Any thoughtful man mu.st see that there is no science 
so important as that of education, the preparation of children of this generation 
to be the citizens, the rulers of the country, in the next generation. The whole 
future of our Empire depends upon the education of the children. By the study 
of this science we hope to improve teaching so as to make future citizens not only 
to have more knowledge and more skill, but to make them wiser than the people 
of the present or the past. 

Early training determines what later training ought to be. Let us consider 
what the early training of a boy ought to be. In his very early days Nature has 
provided that his education shall proceed very rapidly by observation and experi- 
ment, and the only teaching needed is through careful nursing and affection. He 
teaches himself, and he loves to learn. He ought to get toys not too realistic, 
for he loves to weave romance round his toys, but still things to observe 
and experiment with. He has most complex problems in physical science when 
he is only a few weeks old, the solution of which involves much labour, but it is 
pleasant labour and he is happy. And he will remain sweet-tempered and happy 
and unspoilt if there is real affection from his teachers. If, however, somebody 
teases him by playing practical jokes, or if a selfish mother who was unreasonably 
kind to him yesterday is unreasonably unkind to him to-day, he gets, because of 
his reasoning power, a sense of injustice. Man, woman, or child with a sense of 
injustice may be said to be possessed of a devil. During the first six years of a 



604 TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION L. 

child's life the creation of its power to reason is more wonderful than anything 
else, and this reasoning power comes altogether by observation and experiment. 
An affectionate parent easily finds methods of helpijig Nature in this process. 
The unspoilt boy of six years seems to forget nothing that he hears; he has 
gathered a most wonderful vocabulary; he knows endless nursery rhymes and 
simple poetry ; he is as active and adventurous as a kitten, and everything he does 
is cultivating his senses. This is the time when he fills the smallest playground 
(which to grown-ups seems bare and desolate) with giants and fairies and Indians 
and pirates, with forests and mountains and rivers and oceans. His imagination 
is so extraordinary that the most uncouth creation of his own gives him exquisite 
pleasure. Why do I dwell upon this stage of a boy's development? Because it 
has been so perfect ! Nature has learnt to do' this to children during perhaps 
hundreds of thousands of years, and it has been the most important time of a 
boy's life, the time when, if parents will only give the boy their love and greatly 
let him alone otherwise, he develops mentally more than during all the rest 
of his life. Speaking broadly, he has done nothing in all this time except 
what Nature and affection made pleasant to him. I have studied the science of 
education and practised the art of teaching all my life, and I say that all our 
failures are due to our neglect of Nature's methods, and our schools destroy the 
good effects which Nature has produced. 

As a rule I do not like to be told that certain subjects must be compulsory, 
but surely every child of eleven must have some such qualifications as these : 
(1) The power to speak and read and write in his own language. (2) To be able to 
do easy computation. (3) To have an exact knowledge of the simplest principles of 
Natural Science from his own observation and experiment. I think that every ob- 
server must acknowledge that these powers are possible for almost every boy of 
eleven. Some of us have for many years been endeavouring to show how the child 
of six may acquire these powers by the age of eleven if Nature's methods — that 
is, Kindergarten methods — are followed. For example, he plays at keeping shop, 
selling or buying things by weight and measure, and paying or receiving actual 
money and giving change. He weighs and measures with greater and greater 
accuracy as he makes experiments in mechanics and heat and chemistry. Every 
boy is fond of stories, and if treated reasonably is easily induced to learn to read. 
Reading aloud is easily made a pleasure and a habit, and so the boy learns to 
speak properly. Any boy whatever will become fond of reading if the people 
about him are fond of reading : I state this as a fact which I have investigated. 
A boy who is fond of reading gets later on to know the value of books and the 
use of books, and he will go on educating himself till he dies. Any attempt at 
coercion, unless it is the very gentle coercion of a person whom he loves, is fatal ; 
even coaxing is not always good. He assimilates knowledge from everything 
which he does, and therefore he ought to be induced to do things which not only 
keep him healthy, but which give him knowledge and teach him to reason. Do 
you remember how angry Lanfranc of Bee was at the idea that any pupil could 
be forced to learn; he said ' it turned men into beasts.' I speak to you who love 
children, who love young people, who know that there is hardly one child in a 
hundred, even among rather spoilt children, who does not love to do his duty. 

Under the best and most loving of teachers a lonely child has enormous dis- 
advantages, but these can generally be remedied. The usual mistake is to send it 
to a large school. If it is merely a day school there is no great harm. But no 
child under thirteen ought to be sent to a boarding school unless it is a small 
school and the master and his wife have a love and sympathy for other people's 
children. There are such people in the world, God bless them ! but they are not 
numerous. They are so few that we must return to Nature as the best of 
teachers. The time is coming when a child's own father and mother will have 
much more knowledge and wisdom than they have now, and they will refuse to 
give up to others the doing of their highest duties. It is at present not sufliciently 
recognised that the most important duty of the parents is the education of their 
children. At present, men who are building up fortunes are too busy to think of 
their children, and so we find that the sons of Lord Chancellors and other success- 
ful men have been marrying chorus girls and squandering those very fortunes to 
which their education was sacrificed. Of course, if parents are uneducated, and 
therefore selfish or otherwise foolish, any kind of school may be better than home 
for their doomed children. It is one of the great advantages of poverty that the 



PEESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 605 

children go to day schools and they keep in touch with home life. If the day 
school is really a boarding school as well, it will be found that there is always a 
differentiation in favour of the boarder, which has a very bad caste effect, just as 
the ' modern-side ' boy of any public school suffers in character because he is of a 
lower caste than the classical-side boy. It is usual to remove a stupid classical- 
side boy to the modern side, and every boy on the modern side has a sense of 
injustice. The work of the modern side ought to be much the higher, but it is 
always badly done because the atmosphere is altogether bad. 

It may be said that I am only destructive in my criticism of public schools. I 
think it will be found that I am also constructive, although I acknowledge that 
my sketch needs much filling in. Well, can much more be done in an address 
lasting one hour? I will now try my hand at a little filling in. I have no objec- 
tion to the existence of classical schools something like the present for boys who 
are fond of classics. The average boy will not be asked to attend such a school. 
I feel sure that much greater attention ought to be paid to the teaching of 
English composition, to English poetry and prose, and to English subjects 
generally. I also feel sure that much attention ought to be paid to Natural 
Science. And surely it can do no good for the classical masters to go on sneering 
at Natural Science subjects and calling them ' stinks ' as they do now. 

I want, however, to speak more particularly of a much higher kind of school, 
which will educate the boy usually called clever and also the boy usually called 
stupid. As I have already remarked, I think that these names may sometimes be 
redistributed. 

The school is one for boys from eleven to sixteen years of age. It ought in no 
way to be connected with any classical school. English subjects will predominate, 
but teaching in Latin and. Greek and modern languages and other alternative 
subjects will be provided, although they will not be forced upon any boy. The 
masters who teach English ought to know enough Latin and Greek and Celtic and 
Old English and modern languages to be able to illustrate the derivation of 
English words through their roots. And they must be well read in English sub- 
jects and fond of English literature. They will make the boys fond of reading 
English, and encourage them to find out what they like best. Some boys will 
take to history and philosophy, some to poetry and imaginative literature. Every 
boy ought to get the best chance of developing his faculties. It may be asked — 
if we cannot make the average boy spend or waste twelve hours a week on Latin, 
what are we to do with him ? At all events, now, we keep him dtiing something, 
even if it is only marking time. jNIy answer is, you think only of his putting in 
time ; well, then, let him put in his time at work that interests him ; any work of 
that kind must be educative under an intelligent master who can help him in his 
studies if it induces him to look up information for himself. Thus, when reading 
travels or history, he will use the globe and raised maps and read geography, 
and hunt up plans of battlefields. Think of the things that a boy used to be 
punished for doing, and let him do those things under wise direction. I used to 
be punished for reading Scott and Cooper. Nowadays prizes are given to boys 
for their knowledge of Ivanhoe or Quentin Durward. Expand this into a system. 
A boy who loves to browse over Chambers's English Literature ought to be guided 
in his browsing, and induced to take iip something more than selections, and he 
may easily be induced to get off selections by heart if his teacher does not show 
his contempt by speaking of such exercises as Bep. [repetition]. 

Let the teacher take a leaf out of our methods of teaching chemistry and 
physics. It has been shown that twenty-five boys doing work in the laboratory dur- 
ing a lesson of an hour and a half or two hours can be managed by one teacher. 
Experimental lectures in a lecture room have now been greatly discarded ; such 
lessons as I speak of take place in the laboratory, but reliance is placed par- 
ticularly upon the personal attention of the teacher being given to each gi-oup of 
students in charge of an investigation, the group not being usually greater than 
four in number, and often being less than two. These students are some- 
times merely verifying or testing a statement made by the teacher or found in a 
book, but they are often finding out things for themselves. One idea underlyintr 
the work is that there ought to be more and more illustrations of simple funda° 
mental principles. It is long before these simple things really become part of a 
boy's mental machinery; things like the mere definition of force, for example. 
It is, of course, quite different work for the teacher from anything that he used 



606 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION L. 

to have to do ; for one thing, being much more exhausting. He cannot shirk his 
duties and sit down waiting for students to come to him. When teaching 
degenerates into mere maintenance of discipline, everything being regarded as 
right if the pupils are quiet and seem to be diligent, it is necessary to make a 
radical change, usually a dismissal of the teacher. It used to be that a science 
master gave an experimental lecture, and afterwards he had a very easy time, 
letting the students follow a set routine in the laboratory, but this will no longer 
do; such attendance at lectures and laboratory work means poor mental training. 
Now, I would work out a system for English, English composition, English 
poetry and prose, geography, history, and other Engli.sh subjects, on the lines that 
we have found so successful in Natural Science. An enormous change has been 
effected during the last fifteen years in the teaching of mathematics. The older 
methods always failed with the average boy or man. The new system, which is 
.=;ometimes called Practical Mathematics, is based on the idea that students shall 
work experimentally, just as they do in their Natural Science. It is found that 
their eyes and faces are bright, they work hard, and they evidently enjoy their 
work. We have merely introduced common sense into the teaching; we have 
approached the student's mind from other points of view than the old academic 
one, from the only side on which he has ever been taught anything — the side of 
observation and trial. He weighs and measures. He does experimental 
geometry and mensuration, and is assisted by abstract reasoning just to the 
extent which interests him ; he makes plans of the school buildings and maps 
of the district ; algebra becomes interesting when in co-ordination with experi- 
ments in mechanics and physics; trigonometry becomes interesting in the actual 
measurements of heights and distances. The infinitesimal calculus is bound to 
be a weapon which any boy of fifteen easily gets to understand by actual use 
when he is dealing with dynamic experiments. In fact, the physical and 
mathematical laboratories are in one, and the same teacher takes charge of both 
subjects and teaches them as much as possible together. 

Furthermore, in the preparation of an account of an investigation there are 
practical lessons in English composition ; there is sketching, and also more careful 
drawing with instruments, and the finding of empirical laws, using squared paper. 
In such a school every subject is being taught through all the other subjects ; 
every boy is doing the work in which he is greatly interested, and no boy is 
attending merely and putting in time. Furthermore, out of school-time there 
might be the usual restrictions as to ' bounds,' but otherwise I would let a boy do 
pretty much as he pleased. ' Prep.' at boarding schools and home lessons for boys 
at day schools are to be quite discredited. I would — it may cost a little more 
money — allow a boy to work in the workshops or laboratories or library or in his 
own room or common rooms at anything he pleases in this off-time, and I would 
give him advice only if he asks for it. If I saw a boy reading a penny dreadful 
I would not stop him ; nor if he were reading Paine's ' Age of Reason,' or any 
wretched treatise on psychology or logic. I would in no way discourage a boy 
from acquiring a greater and greater fondness for reading, knowing that this is 
the foundation of future happiness and education, and that no harm which he 
can get from his reading is of the slightest importance in comparison with the 
importance of our main object. As he grows up he will become less and less 
fond of the sixpenny magazine. The school can at its best be merely a prepara- 
tion for the lifelong education of the man. I would not keep the boy at school 
after- sixteen. Let him then go into business, or to a science or technical school, 
or to the University. 

Unfortunately for the present no University will take men without an 
entrance examination involving other languages than English. This is a great 
evil, but it is not going to last much longer. In the meantime a competent coach 
will prepare any student to pass the necessary examinations (say, in Latin and 
Greek) in three months, even if there is much other work to do. This is not a 
matter of learning any classics ; it is rather the manufacture of some contempt 
for the classics, a necessary evil for the present. Indeed, for the present, but 
let us hope not for long, there are many other necessary evils. We have to find 
competent enthusiastic teachers, we have to persuade governing bodies to pay 
salaries two or more times as great as at present, we have to make parents see 
that some mental training and fondness for reading and writing are really of 
value and that Tom Sawyerism about Latin is only childish. 



PRESIPENTIAL ADDRESS. 607 

The importance of primaiT^ education is now well recognised. Rich and 
aristocratic folk know that they are now in the hands of tlie common people in 
a democratic country, and it is important to see that the common people shall 
be made fit to rule and shall have a real sense of fairness and reasonableness. 
Above all, if they are to be good citizens we must cultivate their common sense. 
I think that in the schemes and the administration of primary education by 
the Boards of England and Scotland it is in a good way ; but there is one great 
curse upon it, and the enormous sums of money spent upon it are greatly wasted. 
The local authorities give to every teacher far too much to do, and they give him 
only half his proper wages. In a few years the Government of our democratic 
country will be in the hands of the boys now at school. That they should be good 
citizens full of common sense is more important than any other thing. If they 
are without fondness for books, and if they cannot reason, their votes will be at 
the command of fraudulent or foolish, or perhaps only selfish or self-deceiving 
speakers. Our empire was ruled by George the Third, and by God's grace we 
only lost America and piled up the National Debt ; but think of an empire 
ruled by millions of Georges ! Teaching the young requires great wisdom and 
sympathy, and we entrust it to people paid half wages, the ' otherwise unem- 
ployed.' In the secondary schools also we find this penny wise pound foolish 
policy, and it is particularly evil in the great technical schools. A city is proud 
of its magnificent college of science, first because of its architecture; secondly 
because of its equipment in apparatus, perhaps in steam and gas engines and 
other expensive machinery. And the man in charge of the most important 
department of that college receives perhaps 250?. a year. He ought to get at 
least 600?. That is the market price of a fit man, and without a fit man the 
whole money and the time of students are being wasted ; the thing is really a 
fraud, a whited sepulchre, and of course the Principal is always a classical 
non-scientific man. Photographs of the building and its laboratories are 
very fine to look at in guide-books of the city, and the managers of the college 
get public thanks tor their services. I know nearly all the technical and science 
colleges of Great Britain, and I hardly ever see any of their complacent managers, 
members of their governing bodies, without wishing that I had some of the 
powers of the familiars of the old Spanish Inquisition. What right have they 
to undertake duties which require a knowledge of Natural Science ? 

The latest proposal of our callous copiers of the Germans is to make 
attendance at evening classes compulsory up to the age of seventeen. At present 
working boys attend evening classes voluntarily, although in many cases they 
are too tired to learn much. Yet many of them do learn. These boys are 
almost martyrs. They sacrifice so many of their poor pleasures, and indeed 
duties, that they certainly deserve success in life. But it is not fair to impose 
these sacrifices upon boys who are, as apprentices, learning the principles under- 
lying their trade, and who are paid only small wages on the understandii:ig that 
their masters teach these principles. In 18S9 I introduced a. Bill into the 
Kensington Parliament compelling employers to provide such instruction during 
the working hours. Reforms of all kinds proceed with exasperating slowness, 
but already many employers are carrying out this idea. 

In some things we reformers have made way. It is now recognised almost 
everywhere that examinations ought to be conducted mainly by the teachers of a 
student. I have often put the matter in this way : Huxley used to teach about 
forty students in biology; we cannot imagine better teaching. But if those 
students had only wanted to pass the examination of London University it is 
quite certain that they would have done very much better by attending the 
class of a cheap crammer. A University consisting of two, three, or more 
federated colleges is very little better than a mere outside examining body, and 
this is what London University has always been. I am glad that a change 
towards something better is now about to take place. A number of separate 
Universities would be better, but in two years or less, probably, the colleges of 
London will conduct their own intermediate and degree examinations. One 
result will be that when a man gets his degree he will not shut up his books 
for ever. 

I would, however, point out that old London University, which was a mere 
examining body, served an exceedingly important purpose. This statement may 



60S TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION L. 

seem curious coming from a person who has always railed at London University 
as a mere examining board. I still say that it was never a University at all in 
the past. But a man reading hard by himself, perhaps far away from a college, 
could have a severe test applied to his acquirements which encouraged him in 
his studies when he had no other encouragement, and the test was very rightly 
a severe test. To do away with its outside examinations altogether, as I believe 
is the intention of the authorities, will be exceedingly harmful. It would be 
impertinent in me to make a suggestion as to the distinction which might be 
made between a degree conferred by his own professors upon a man who has 
attended regularly a college of repute, and a degree conferred by a mere examin- 
ing body upon an outside student. For the first, the examination test may be 
easy. The Oxford and Cambridge pass degree examinations are quite easy, and 
rightly so, for the real qualification is that an undergraduate shall have lived for 
three years in the intellectual and cultured life of an Oxford or Cambridge col- 
lege. In the other case the mere examination is the only test, and it is rightly very 
severe. The two kinds of degree differ altogether in quality. In a new country 
of great distances I can imagine many good secondary schools to be established 
having neither sufficient funds nor sufficient pupils to be qualified as Universities. 
Yet it may be of enormous importance that a few of the older jjupils at such 
schools should as e.\ternal students be examined for degrees by distant Universi- 
ties, which, in such a case, are merely outside examining bodies. I can see the 
gradual increase in importance of such secondary schools leading to the estab- 
lishment of something higher — namely, colleges of University rank — and I can 
see such affiliated colleges becoming Universities themselves perhaps after a period 
ill which two or more of them federated themselves as Universities. But I say 
that there ought always to be some examination machinery by which a student 
who is too poor or who through any other circumst-ance is unable to attend a 
TTniversity college may be encouraged to study by himself, by having his 
attainments tested. 

In this Address I have said nothing about the education of women. I have 
always advocated higher education for girls, but it is surely wicked to teach 
girls as if they were boy.s. Men are concentrative, and they specialise ; 
women observe more and more about many things, and they really have more 
capacity for acquiring mental power. Until quite recently girls were saved 
from stupidity, but the high schools are now giving a crammed knowledge of 
facts and of the opinions of the tribe, so that girls and women are ceasing to 
think for themselves. The education of men is in a bad way, but that of women 
is becoming much worse. 

I think that in this Address 1 have put for\v:ird no idea that I have not 
already published time after time in the last thirty-five years. I put these views 
forward again because, after much thought and "much experience, I still think 
them to be correct, and I feel sure that they must prevail. But I must confess 
that it is only a very hopeful man who can peg away at a thankless task as 
Dr. Armstrong and I have been doing so long.

Professor H. E. Ahmstrong, F.E.S., Vice-President, delivered the following 
Address : — 

The Place of Wisdom (Science) in the State and in Education. 

' So soon as men get to discuss the importance of a thing, they do infallibly 
set about arranging it, facilitating it, forwarding it and rest not till in some 
approximate degree they have accomplished it.' — ^Carlyle. 

This, doubtless, is a true statement; the difficulty is, however, to persuade men 
of the importance of a thing. We come to persuade you. As an Association 
we are now eighty- four years old : our main purpose has been to obtain a 



TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION L. 609 

more general attention to the objects uf JScience and a removal of any disadvan- 
tages of a public kind which impede its progress — let me also add, its application 
to culture and to the public service. 

By holding meetings, year after year, in the principal towns of the British 
Isles, the Association has at least brought under notice the fact that Science is a 
reality, in so far as this can be testified to by several hundreds of its votaries 
meeting together each year to consider seriously and discuss the progress of the 
various departments. On the whole, dilettanti have had little share in our 
debates. The Association has already carried tlie flag of Knowledge outside our 
islands, thrice to Canada and once to (~'outh Africa ; now, at last, we make this 
great pilgrimage to your Australian shores : still we are at home. What message 
do we bring w ith us ? 

In 1847, when this city was but an insignificant town, it was visited by an 
Englishman who subsequently became eminent not only in Science but also as a, 
literary man — Thomas Henry Huxley ; he was then surgeon on board the survey- 
ing ship 'Rattlesnake.' In 1848 Huxley visited Sydney and there met the 
gracious lady, only recently deceased, who became his wife. In after years he 
achieved a great reputation on account of his services to education. 

Lecturing in London in 1854, he defined Science as ' trained and organised 
common sense' — a definition often quoted since; none could be more apposite, 
though it must be remembered that 'common sense,' after all, is but an 
uncommon sense. 

A few years later, in a public lecture at South Kensington, Huxley spoke to 
the following effect : — 

' The whole of modern thought is steeped in Science ; it has made its way 
into the works of our best poets and even the mere man of letters, who affects 
to ignore and despise Science, is unconsciously impregnated with her spirit and 
indebted for his best products to her methods. I believe that the greatest intel- 
lectual revolution mankind has yet seen is now slowly taking place by her 
agency. She is teaching the world that the ultimate court of appeal is observa- 
tion and experiment and not authority; she is teaching it the value of evidence; 
she is creating a firm and living faith in the existence of immutable moral and 
physical laws perfect obedience to which is the highest possible aim of an 
intelligent being. 

' But of all this your old stereotyped system of education takes no note. 
Physical Science, its methods, its problems and its difficulties, will meet the 
poorest boy at every turn and yet we educate him in such a manner that he 
shall enter the world as ignorant of the existence of the methods and facts of 
Science as the day he was born. The modern world is full of artillery ; and we 
turn our children out to do battle in it equipped with the shield and sword of 
an ancient gladiator. 

' Postrriti/ will cry shame on us if we do not remedy this deplorable state 
of things. Nay, if we live twenty years longer, our own consciences will cry 
shame on us.' 

These words were uttered in 1861. Now, after more than fifty years, not 
twenty merely, we still go naked and unashamed of our ignorance : seemingly, 
there is no conscience within us to cry shame on us. I have no hesitation in 
saying that, at home, at all events, whatever your state here may be, we have 
done but little through education to remedy the condition of public ignorance 
which Huxley deplored. In point of fact, he altogether imderrated the power 
of the forces of ignorance and indifference ; he failed to foresee that these were 
likely to grow rather than to fall into abeyance. In England, what I will 
venture to term the Oxford spirit still reigns supreme — the spirit of the literary 
class — the medireval spirit of obscurantism, which favours a backward rather 
than a forward outlook. 

Wherein was Huxley out in his forecast ? In 1861 the claim of Science was 
already strong but think what has been done since that time — what we can 
now assert of its conquests ! In the interval, even within my recollection, the 
whole of our ironclad fleet has been created, rifled cannon, smokeless powder 
and dynamite have been introduced, and this last, in combination with the 
discovery of the causes of yellow fever and malaria, has made the Panama

Canal possible, an entirely revolutionary work of man's interfering hands. The 
' Great Eastern,' which could not be launched at first on account of her size — 
as a lad, I saw her sticking in the stocks — was a failure, because she was outside 
the fashion of her time, yet she has given rise to a host of ocean leviathans 
of far larger size; the steam-turbine has entered into rivalry with the recipro- 
cating steam-engine ; cold storage has revolutionised ocean transport, so that 
fresh food can be carried from this continent to remote England and Europe. 
Electricity, then a puling infant, is grown to giant size ; not only have we deep- 
sea telegraphy and mechanical speech in the form of the phonograph and tele- 
phone, but wireless communication, the electric light, electric transmission of 
power, electric traction — even the waterfalls of the world are tamed through the 
turbine and made subservient to our will for motive purposes or in the pro- 
duction of temperatures bordering on those of solar heat, by means of which too 
we can draw food for plants, at will, from our atmosphere by combining its 
constituents into the form of a fertiliser. The use of oil-fuel in the internal- 
combustion engine has been made possible and, in a few short years, the streets 
of London have been cleared of horse conveyances and crowded with motor- 
vehicles ; such engines are coming into use everywhere and enable us successfully 
to perform the feat which Daedalus vainly attempted — we even talk of flying 
from New York to London, across the vast Atlantic, to spend the week-end. 
The cyanide process has been introduced into gold-mining and is enabling us to 
unearth a fabulous wealth ; a vast array of gorgeous colours has been produced 
and Dame Nature so outwitted that we make indigo and madder out of the tar 
which in old days was put only upon fences; Pasteur's work has made Listerism 
possible, so that nothing is now beyond the surgeon's art and bacteriology is 
become the handmaid of preventive medicine and sanitary science; not only 
paper but an artificial silk is made from wood-pulp and the finest of scents 
are conjured out from all but waste materials. A multitude of other discoveries 
of practical value might be referred to. 

But there is a reverse side to the picture. At this very moment we realise 
with horror that whilst we liave destructive forces at our disposal, unknown 
to pre-scientific generations, of a most terrible kind, our human nature is in 
no proportionate way subject to modification — nor is it likely that it ever will 
be — so that the desire to destroy grows less as the means grow greater. It will 
be my argument, indeed, throughout this Address, that Science is something 
apart—a cult which can influence but the few. 

Not so long ago, when scientific research was spoken of, the cry was always 
Cui bono? What's the good of it all? Now, no one has the patience to listen 
to a recital of the benefits accruing to manliind from its operation ; for all the 
achievements I have referred to art not the worh of mere inventors but primarily 
the outcome of scientific discovery : thus our modern command of electricity is 
very largely traceable to the labours of the great philosopher Faraday, who 
worked in an ill-lighted and cramped laboratory in the Royal Institution in 
Albemarle Street, London, with no other object than that of contributing to the 
advancement of knowledge. 

Perhaps the greatest of all the scientific achievements of our time remains to 
be mentioned — the promulgation of the doctrine of Evolution by Charles Darwin. 
Few perhaps can realise what this means for mankind, the intellectual advance 
it constitutes — that through it we have at last acquired full intellectual freedom 
and the belief that it rests with ourselves alone rightly to order our lives ; that 
by it all dogmas have been undermined. 

No one has stated this better than Oliver Wendell Holmes, in saying : ' If, 
for the Fall of Man, Science comes to substitute the Rise of Man, it means the 
utter disintegration of all the spiritual pessimisms which have been like a spasm 
in the heart and a cramp in the intellect of men for so many centuries.' 

Let me say that Huxley did much to give credence to this same doctrine of 
Evolution : on which account Australia may well feel proud that he visited her 
shores and of the use that he made of his oj^portunity ; our visit is but the 
logical sequence of his and we are but come to emphasise his message. 

' During the last three hundred years reason has been slowly but steadily 
destroying Christian mythology and exposing the pretensions of supernatural 
revelation.'

So writes Profpssor Bury, the Professor of Modern History in the University 
of Cambridge, in his recently published ' History of Freedom of Thought,' one 
of the most charming historical essays ever put together. Again, he remarks : — 

' If the history of civilisation has any lesson to teach, it is this : There is 
one supreme condition of mental and moral progress which it is completely 
within the power of man himself to secure and that is perfect liberty of 
thought and discussion. The establishment of this liberty may be considered 
the most valuable achievement of modern civilisation and as a condition of 
social progress it should be deemed fundamental.' 

Science is come into being and has prospered only since freedom of thought 
was secured : on no other terms can it be. It is well that we should bear this 
in mind. The gi'owth of numbers and of democracy may well involve a re- 
striction of freedom in all directions — none are so intolerant as the ignorant. 

If in Science, to-day, we have something unknown to former civilisations, 
what is its influence to be on the future of the world, in particular on the 
future of the white people? If we are not to suffer the rise and fall which all 
previous civilisations have passed through — rather let me say, if the -period of 
our fall is to be retarded beyond the period our forerunners enjoyed, it will be 
solely because we wield and use the powers Science has put into our hands : not 
so much those of abstract science but the broad wisdom which the proper 
cultivation of Science should confer; hence it is that I desire to urge the 
absolute importance of giving, through Science, a place to the cultivation of 
wisdom in the State and therefore in education. 

Clearly, two new forces are at work in the world : not Science alone but also 
a broad and altruistic Socialism, both the outcome of the intellectual freedom 
man has acquired since the deposition of the Churches. The one is gradually 
leading us to base our actions upon knowledge and to be practical through the 
use of theory; the other is leading us gradually, though slowly, to have con- 
sideration for one another, to recognise how helpless are the majority, how 
greatly they stand in need of the guidance of the few who are capable of 
leading. But we shall need to order our Socialism by Science to make it a wise 
Socialism. The signs are only too numerous that a wave of political despotism 
may come over us. Either, as time goes on, Science will be more and more of 
service in guiding the social machine — or that machine will perish, from the very 
complexity of its organisation and the inability of the units to understand their 
place, to understand the need of subordinating their individual inclinations to 
communal interests ; most important of all, to understand their inability to 
recognise and require competent leadership — for Science is aristocratic in its 
tendencies : indeed, I shall claim that real Science — Wisdom — is for the very few. 

The arrogance of ignorance at the present day leads too many to brush all 
such considerations aside. It is only too rarely that thinking men have the 
courage to pronounce judgment as clearly as did recently a distinguished 
dignitary of the Church, Dr. Inge, the Dean of St. Paul's, the cathedral of our 
greatest city, in a strikingly outspoken course of lectures to women. The warning 
he gave is worth pondering over : — 

' Democracy is perhaps the silliest of all fetishes that are seriously wor- 
shipped among us. The method of counting heads, instead of breaking them, 
is no doubt convenient as a rough and ready test of strength : since government 
must rest mainly on force. It is also at least arguable that democracy is, at 
present, a good instrument for procuring social justice and for educating citizens 
in civic duty. But that is really all that anyone has a right to say in its 
favour. . . . There is absolutely no guarantee, in the nature of things, that the 
decision of the majority will be either wise or just ; and what is neither wise 
nor just ought not to be done. This is a somewhat elementary truism to 
enunciate to an intelligent audience; but there stands the ridiculous fetish 
grinning in our faces and the whole nation burns incen.se before it.' 

The message of Science must be to the same effect. If the Christian spirit 
prevail. Science and Socialism must ultimately go hand in hand — but true 
Socialism, not the spurious article advocated by the limited intelligence of the 
political intriguer of the day who leaves altogether out of account human nature

and its imperfections while preying npon the giillibilitj' of the masses. .Science 
is not yet a sufficiently public possession, however, to make a rational and 
considerate Socialism possible. 

That religion will ultimately be placed upon a scientific basis — though perhaps 
only in far-off days — may also be anticipated, for it has been well said that in 
literature we already have homilies innumerable : that God's universe is a 
symbol of the Godlike ; Immensity a Temple; Man's and Men's history a perpetual 
Evangel. In thus quoting Carlyle, I am aware of Mr. Balfour's ill-judged, 
flippant reference to his ' windy prophesyings ' — that for the time being his 
Puritanism is out of fashion. But I prefer Huxley's estimate, who uses 
memorable words in saying ; — 

' " Sartor Eesartus " led me to know that a deep sense of religion was com- 
patible with the entire absence of theology. . . . Science and her methods gave 
me a resting-place independent of authority and traditions. 

' The longer I live the more obvious it is to me that the most sacred act of 
man's life is to say and to feel " I believe such and such to be true." All the 
greatest rewards and all the heaviest penalties of existence cling about that act. 
The universe is one and the same throughout; and if the condition of my success 
in unravelling some little difficulty of anatomy or physiology is that I shall 
rigorously refuse to put faith in that which does not rest on sufficient evidence, 
I cannot believe that the great mysteries of existence will be laid open to me on 
other terms. It is no use to talk to me of analogies and probabilitie's. I know 
what I mean when I say, I believe in the law of the inverse squares and I will 
not rest my life and my hopes upon weaker convictions. I dare not if I would.' 

' Science seems to me to teach in the highest and strongest manner the great 
truth which is embodied in the Christian conception of entire surrender to the 
will of God. Sit down before a fact as a little child, be prepared to give up 
every preconceived notion, follow humbly wherever and to whatever abysses 
Nature leads or you shall learn nothing. I have only begun to learn content and 
peace of mind since I have resolved at all risks to do this.' 

These remarkable passages occur in one of Huxley's letters to the Rev. 
Charles Kingsley; probably they are a fair representation of the faith that is in 
all whose vievs's of life are ordered on a scientific basis. At least, they indicate 
our attitude towards utterances such as Sir Oliver Lodge has given expression to 
even from the Presidential Chair of this Association and to the fancies woven 
by Mr. Balfour in his recent Gifford Lectures. Sir Oliver has asserted that ' the 
methods of Science are not the only way, though they are our way, of arriving 
at the truth.' It is scarcely necessary to controvert so illogical a statement. 
If they are our way, it is because the methods of Science are the only methods 
known to us which we can apply in our search for truth : all methods which 
lead to truth are necessarily methods of science. 

With all the marvellous growth of achievement to which I have referred, 
there has been no proportionate growth of public intelligence. Our Admiralty 
and to a far less extent our War Office have called Science into their service 
but our public Departments generally will have none of it. Even the elements 
of an understanding of the methods of Science are not thought to be essential to 
the education of a Civil Servant ; such knowledge is not required even in the 
highest branches of the Indian Service — no politician is ever supposed to need 
it : we are governed almost entirely by the literary spirit. 

Our newspaper press is in the hands of literary men. Even ' The Times ' 
gives no regular place to Science — now and then chance reference is made to 
some discovery but too often the account is garbled. It publishes Literary and 
Educational Supplements in neither of which Science figures ; and recently, on 
reducing its price in order to increase its popularity, it abandoned the weekly 
publication of its Engineering Supplement and issues this only monthly in an 
emasculated form. The Liberal press is distinguished by the infrequency of its 
references to scientific questions and by the superlative inaccuracy of the state- 
ments that are made. The ' Morning Post,' by reporting the meetings of 
societies and by opening its columns recently to a lengthy correspondence 
on ' Science and the State,' howevei", has shown sympathy with us.

The ' Daily Telegiai-ih ' alone of the Conservative papci's retains the ser- 
vices of an eminent scientific writer but even Science cannot make a 
summer of one swallow. Editors who do not appreciate a subject themselves 
are not likely to suppose that others will care for it. Lastly, I am told 
by friends high up in the publishing trade that there is no demand for readable 
books on Science — only text-books sell and provided always that they are 
written on conventional lines, so that their contents can be memorised. Never- 
theless, I have hopes, since Messrs. Dent have issued Faraday's ' Electro- 
Chemical Researches ' as one of the shilling volumes in their wonderful ' Every- 
man ' series ; this is the one promising speck of white cloud on an otherwise black 
horizon. 

The spirit of the age, in fact, is in no way scientific, though ease and comfort 
are now provided on an unprecedented scale through the agency of Science, the 
engineer acting as chief interpreter. The Churches will have none of it and 
almost glory in their ignorance. 

Why is this ? Why was Huxley so out iu his forecast made in 1861 ? Why 
do we still go naked and unashamed of our ignorance of ' Science ' ? 

One main reason is that the party in power is unscientific; but at bottom, 
I believe, the difficulty is a far greater one and probably innate in our dis- 
position. It cannot well be supposed that man is by nature disposed to be 
scientific. The scientific fraternity, at any time, are and probably always will 
be but a small party — a set of freaks, sports from the multitude. They think 
and talk in a language of their own, as musicians do. The multitude may listen 
to them at times, with more or less of pleasure, as they do to music; but it is 
impossible and probably always will be impossible for the many to appreciate 
the methods and results of the scientific worker. Science, in reality, is a form 
of art and true arti.sts are never numerous; moreover, it is admitted that they 
are born — like Topsy, they must grow, for they are not to be made in numbers. 
Our schools are for the most part in literary hands : and it would almost appear 
that literary and scientific interests are antagonistic, so unsympathetic has been 
the reception accorded to Science by the schools. 

Parenthetically, let me here deny the accusation not unfrequently made by 
literary writers that the scientific fraternity are trying to oust literary studies 
from the schools. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are alwaj's 
craving for better literary training ; our complaint is that the methods and 
subject-matter of literary training are far from being properly developed and, 
especially, that English is neglected in the schools. Huxley stated the real 
situation in saying ' Science and literature are not two things but two sides of 
the same thing.' Our attitude and the difference between the two kinds of 
training could not be better defined than it is in the following passage from one 
of his lectures : — • 

' If I insist unweariedly, nay fanatically, upon the importance of physical 
science as an educational agent, it is because the study of any branch of 
Science, if properly conducted, appears to me to fill up a void left by all other 
means of education. I have the greatest respect and love for literature ; nothing 
would grieve me more than to see literary training other than a very prominent 
branch of education : indeed, I wish that real literary discipline -were far more 
attended to than it is ; but I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that there is a 
vast difference between men who liave had a purely literary and those who have 
had a sound scientific training. 

' Seeking for the cause of this difference, I imagine I can find it in the fact 
that, in the world of letters, learning and knowledge are one and books are the 
source of both ; whereas in Science, as in life, learning and knowledge are 
distinct and the study of things and not of books is the source of the latter. 

' All that literature has to bestow may be obtained by reading and by 
practical exercise in writing and speaking: but I do not exaggerate when I say 
that none of the best gifts of Science are to be won by these means. On the 
contrary, the great benefit which a scientific education bestows, whether as 
training or as knowledge, is dependent upon the extent to which the mind of 
the student is brought into immediate contact with facts — upon the degree to 
which he learns the habit of appealing directly to Nature and of acquiring 
through his senses concrete images of those properties of things which are and 



614 TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION L. 

always will be but approximately expressed in human language. Our way of 
looking at Nature and of speaking about her varies from year to year ; but a 
fact once seen, a relation of cause and effect once demonstratively apprehended, 
are possessions which neither change nor pass away but, on the contrary, form 
fixed centres about which other truths aggregate by natural affinity.' 

The rise of Science is due to the introduction of the experimental method. 
Mr. Balfour, in arguing, as he has done recently, that Science rests upon 
many unprovable postulates and therefore does not differ in method from 
metaphysics, has made assertions which cannot be allowed to pass as correct 
True Science rests wholly upon fact and upon logic : all else is mere provisional 
hypothesis — a garment we are prepared to put aside at any moment if cause be 
.shown. We are well aware that human nature is always intervening to spoil 
our work ; it is human to err, and false doctrine may easily occupy the attention 
for a time, but we are fully conscious of our limitations and prepared to admit 
them, whilst we feel that we are ever advancing towards security of knowledge. 

The method of Science, indeed, is the method of the Chancery Court — it 
involves the collection of all available evidence and the subjection of all such 
evidence to the most searching examination and cross-examination. False evi- 
dence may be tendered and for the time being accepted ; but sooner or later 
the perjury is discovered. Our method, in fact, goes beyond that of the courts : 
we are not only always prej^ared to reconsider our judgments but always search- 
ing for fresh evidence; we dare to be positive only when, time aiter time, the 
facts appear to warrant a definite conclusion. But there are few instances in 
which we have travelled so far. The Newtonian theory of gravitation, the 
Daltonian theory of atoms, are two striking examples of generalisations which 
fit all the facts, to which exceptions are not known; should any exception 
be met with we should at once doubt the sufficiency of such theories. In cases 
such as Mr. Balfour has discussed — the problems of metaphysics and of belief — 
experiment and observation are impossible : we can only resort to speculative 
reasoning ; our belief, if we have one, is necessarily founded upon intangibilities 
and desires. 

' There was a door to which I found no key : 
There was a veil past which I could not see ; 

Some little talk awhile of Me and Thee 
There seemed — and then no more of Thee and Me.' 

The awful problem before us at the present time is to decide which direction 
we will take, to what extent and in what way we have the right to teach things 
which transcend our knowledge; the way in which truth lies may be clear to 
some of us but can never be to the majority. Those who wrap up such matters in 
a tangle of words are not helpful, to say the least. However mellifluous the 
terms of Bergsonian philosophy may be, they do not bear analysis when the 
attempt is made to interpret them ; their effect is merely sensuous, like that of 
cathedral music. 

But in order that she may lead. Science must herself set an unimpeachable 
example — far too much that is now taught under the guise of Science is pure 
dogma; in fact, the philosophy of the schools is mostly dogma. The true legal 
habit of mind is insufficiently cultivated and but rarely developed even among 
scientific workers — our logic is too often an imperfect one. In Science, as in 
ordinary life, party politics run high and scientific workers are usually, for the 
time being, party politicians. We are too often crass specialists, always very 
human : indeed^ whatever the lines along which Evolution has taken place, 
they cannot well have been such as to favour in any considerable degree the 
development of the proclivities which distinguish the scientific inquirer : time 
after time, doubtless, he has been knocked on the head, and the spread of his 
kind prevented; now we too often lame him, if we do not kill him, by faulty 
education. 

The difficulties under which Science labours in our schools are partly internal, 
partly external. Tradition and the type of mind of the average teacher favour 
set lessons and literary study by blocks of learners; the extra cost of the work 
is considerable, when the expense of the special requirements is taken into 
account ; more time and more individual effort are demanded both from teacher 



TRANRAOTTONS OP BRCTION L, 015 

and from taught; freedom is hampered by the need of considering the require- 
ments of external examinations; finally, the Universities have done but little 
to help and though the schools have more or less unwillingly recognised that 
there is some value in scientific studies, in consequence of the persistent demands 
men such as Huxley have made, more especially because it is seen that there 
is money in them, none the less there is still no real demand for them on the 
part of the public. Of this and, in fact, of nearly all the real problems of 
education the public are too ignorant to be judges. 

Having been more than forty years not only a teacher but also a student 
of students and of teachers, of educational methods and of the conditions rmder 
which teaching is carried on, I have been led to form very definite opinions, 
the more so as I have been able to regard the problems not only from the 
pedagogic side but also from that of the chemist and biologist — with some 
knowledge of the mechanism. 

JNIy view — and it is one that I desire to press to a logical conclusion — is that 
we must recognise that human ability is not merelj^ a limited quantity but that 
it varies enormously not only in quantity but also in quality : the human 
orchestra contains a great variety of instruments differing in tone and range, 
but Nature, like man, makes few instruments of superlative excellence, a vast 
number of very poor quality and only a moderate proportion of serviceable 
type. If Science can tell us anything, it is that the democratic and republican 
ideal of equality is the veriest moonshine — a thing that never has been and 
never will be. And education can do very little to alter the state of affairs : 
it cannot change the instrument, at most it can develop its potentialities and 
it may easih', by careless handling, do damage to the working parts. To take 
a special case, of interest at the moment, no contention is less to be justified, 
I believe, than that which has been put forward frequently, of late year?, on 
behalf of women — ^that their disabilities are in no small measure due to the 
fact that we have neglected their education : give them time to educate them- 
selves and they will be as men in all things. Years ago, at our Stockport 
Meeting, I ventured to express the difference by saying that woman is not 
merely female man but in many respects a different animal : the two' sexes have 
necessarily been evolved to fulfil different purposes. Nothing is more instructive 
in the history of modern educational progress than the fact that women have 
asked merely for what men have : at the Universities they have attended the 
men's courses ; not one single course have they demanded on their own account. 
Higher teaching in relation to Domestic Science so-called has only been thought 
of very recently and mainly because men have urged its importance. Most 
serious and, I believe, irreparable injury is being done to women, in London 
especially, by forcing them to undertake the same studies and to pass the same 
University examinations as the men : and the damage is done to- the race, not 
merely to individuals, as the effect of education, whether direct or indirect, is 
clearly to diminish the fei'tility of the intellectual. Some day, perhaps, when 
the present wave of selfishness has passed over us, a rational section of women 
will found a woman's university where women can be taught in ways suitable 
to themselves without injury to themselves. In saying these things, of course 
I am laying myself open to the charge of narrowness — in deprecation I can 
only say, that what we are pleased to call education is, for the most part, so 
futile in substance and in its results that I shall not mind in the least if I am 
accused of decrying it : in my opinion, we should all be better without most of 
it, men and women alike. So far as so-called intellectual education is con- 
cerned, learning to read seems to me to be the one thing worth doing : at 
present it is the thing most neglected in schools. 

The commotion raised in pedagogic circles, during tlie last few months, by 
Madame Montessori is sufficient proof, if one were w-anted, of the hopeless 
crudity of our educational practices. 

To develop a rational system, we need to take into account man's past 
history and to apply evolutionary and biological conceptions. Education, as we 
know it and practise it, after all is a modern superstition — something altogether 
foreign to the nature of the majority of mankind : it is based on the false 
assumnfinn fliat we can all be intellectual; whereas most of us can onlv use

oiu- hands. But the schools neglect hands and attempt the impossible by trying 
to cultivate non-existent wits. Man is doubtless pretty much what he was and 
it is useless trying to make of him what he has never been. The harmless vision 
by which Mr. Wells and other windy idealists are obsessed of a perfect man in 
a perfect future may safely be left out of account for the present. 

We are seeking to educate all. What does this mean ? Practically that 
we are seeking to teach all to read. But when they have learnt, what are the 
majority to read — what will they care to read ? At the schools for young 
gentlemen, the reading taught hitherto has been mostly the reading of Latin 
and Greek. We know the result — the number of persons above school age who 
can and do read either language is negligible. Some of us learn French, 
scarcely any learn German, Spanish is all but neglected : when, therefore, we 
visit the Continent of Europe or South America we can only mumble a few- 
words of the language of the country and usually allow the foreigner we visit 
to speak broken English for us : few of us read his literature. 

The vain attempt is made to put us in touch with the past but no real 
effort is exerted to bring us into contact with the present. W^e have not yet 
taught English in our higher schools but are beginning to think of doing so — 
to this end, we are urging that attention be paid to so-called classical literature, 
forgetting, of course, that for the most part this was written for grown-ups 
and not as food for babes of school age. 

The difficulty is still greater in the case of those who have only passed 
through the elementary schools — the literature that will appeal to most of these 
will be very limited in scope. Our newspapers show pretty clearly what will go 
down : not much — but it represents what is going on in life. In London, when 
the theatres are under discussion, it is often said that people want to be 
amused, not instructed ; to cudgel our dull brains is a dull business to most 
of us. It seems to me that this doctrine should be applied more than it is in 
the schools. At all events, we shall do well to remember the words of the 
holy lama in Rudyard Kipling's ' Kim " : ' Education is greatest blessing if of 
best sorts. Otherwise no ea;thly use.' 

To discover the best sort for each sort of student is our difficulty — who will 
do it? Here comes my point. Not the present race of schoolmaster or of 
educational authority. By placing classical scholars in charge, we seem uncon- 
sciously to have selected men of one particular type of mind for school 
service — men of the literary type ; and this type has been preferred for 
nearly all school posts, mainly because no other type has been available, 
this being the chief product of our Universities, Such men, for the most 
part, have been indifferent to subjects and methods other than literary — 
I verily believe not because they have been positively antagonistic or lacking 
in sympathy but rather because of their negative antagonism : of an innate 
inability to appreciate the aims and methods of any other school of thought 
than their own, especially on account of their entire ignorance of the experi- 
mental method. I believe, moreover, that the difference is fundamental and 
temperamental, not to be overcome by training. Oxford, owing to the bait 
of its classical scholarships, seems to have attracted an entirely peculiar type 
of ability and to stand alone in consequence ; at Cambridge, owing to the hold 
obtained by mathematics, the field has been divided but the mathematician, in 
his way, is often as unpractical by nature as the classic ; fortunately, of late 
years, owing to the rise of the Medical School and that of Natural Science, other 
elements have been introduced and the University has a future of infinite 
promise in consequence, if it will but realise that its primary function is to 
inculcate wisdom rather than to give purely professional training. 

Sympathy is only begotten of understanding : the literary type of mind 
apparently does not and cannot sympathise with the practical side of modern 
scientific inquiry, because it has neither knowledge of the methods of experi- 
mental science nor the faintest desire for such knowledge. 

We need a more practical type of mind for our schools. Pessimist though 
I may appear to be, having watched with close attention, all my life, the great 
struggle that has been going on in and between schools — having had the great 
good fortune also myself to be one of the early workers jn the province of

torliiiiral education and having been associated with tlie development of one 
of tlie greatest of onr boarding schools (Christ's Hospital) — I am, of course, 
aware that very great progress has been made and am, in every way, hopeful 
of the future in store for those who are unaffected by present prejudices. In 
my experience, the men to whom the progress lias been due have, in all cases, 
been trained in a broader school thaji that of Oxford ; the few escapes 
from Oxford who have been successful reformers have been the exceptions 
which prove the rule, as they have shown themselves to be gifted with practical 
instincts : to such men the Oxford literary training has been of extreme value. 
Oxford will not gain its full value until all types of ability are represented in 
fair proportion by its students, not one almost exclusively. When this step is 
taken, the incubus of the Oxford spirit will no longer be upon us :' it will then 
be possible for us to regard education as ' a preparation for life ' — a formula 
often used but usually honoured, hitherto, in the breach, rarely if ever in the 
observance, in our schools. 

You may remember the words addressed to Kim bv that wonderful man the 
Mahbub : 'Son, I am wearied of that viadrissah (school) where they take the 
best years of a man to teach him what he can only learn upon the Road.' This 
is true philosophy — a philosophy that should be noted by the schools, especially 
those here in Australia. 

There must be no misunderstanding. The representatives of literary train- 
ing rely chiefly on a past into which it is well not to look too closely and must 
always work with borrowed capital in the days to come : our side has no distant 
past worth speaking of but is hopeful of a glorious future, in that it will 
always be adding to its knowledge ; we desire to do their party all possible 
justice and shall ever be in need of their assistance and more than grateful 
for the service they render us ; but it must be war to' the knife if they will 
not recognise that, in a progressive age, they cannot lead any longer, that we 
shall decline to put up in future with the conceit and narrowness of outlook of 
the classical scholar. 

The argument I have applied to the teacher is equally applicable to the 
taught — boys and girls, indeed students generally, are of different tyjjes : they 
have different orders of ability and cannot be treated as if all were alike. In 
the beginning, we may tempt them with all sorts of scholastic diet but only, 
in the main, in order to discover their aptitudes; when these are found, they 
should be the main line of attack. In saying this, I am not arguing in favour 
of extreme specialisation but against time being wasted in attempting the 
impossible. Some of us can learn one thing, others another : the schools try to 
force too many into one mould. It is essential that we should try to lay certain 
foundations but useless to proceed when we find that some of them cannot 
be laid. 

This doctrine is applicable especially to the selection of scholars and to the 
training of teachers and of evening-class students. We select our scholars 
almost entirely by literary tests — the result is that we select persons of literary 
aptitude rather than those gifted with practical ability for every kind of service : 
like necessarily breeds like. By insistins: on ' grouped courses ' we too often 
oblige students to take up subjects which they are incapable of paying attention 
to with profit : most of us, probably, have found out that there are many 
subjects which we simply cannot learn, try as we may. 

My own experience has been gained in a wide school. My course of action 
was determined in early days by reading Trench's ' Study of Words,' from 
which I acquired inklings of the art of inquirv and an interest in tracing 
things to their origin. At College, at the end of but a single year's didactic 
study, it was my great good fortune to be honoured with the confidence of mv 
teacher, the discoverer of zinc methyl and the author of the conception of 
valency, who charged me with the solution of a problem : to work out an 
absolute method of determining the organic matter in river and well water. 
Instead of wasting time in merely repeating what others had done, I had to 
help myself in all sorts of ways : the discipline was invaluable. At the end 
of a year and a half, on goiuie to Germanv to study, I again came under the 
influence of a man, an individualist of the first water, who encouraged his

students to think for themselves and do things themselves : he was an arch 
heretic himself and we disputed with himconstantly.' 

When I began to teach, the formal methods in vogue appeared to me unsatis- 
factory. At first I had to instruct medical students. Then, in 1879, Professor 
Ayrton and I became associated with the movement to give technical education, 
in both day and evening classes, started by the City and Guilds Institute. At 
first we were in temporary quarters; then 'the Fins'bury Technical College was 
erected — mainly from our designs. Together with Professor Perry, we there 
developed complete courses of instruction for day engineering students of differ- 
ent types. In 1884 we were transferred to the Central Technical College, 
South Kensington, where again, in conjunction with our colleagues, Professors 
Henriciand Unwin, Professor Ayrton and I devised complete courses for 
engineering students but of a higher grade than at Finsbury.^ Both colleges were 

^ Those were halc.yon times, before the rot had set in which has rendered 
modern German scientific training a discipline so inferior to that imparted 
while the high ideals set by Liebig and Bunsen were alone operative : money- 
making was not yet the object ; in fact, the Alizarin patent was only taken out 
at that time and the Salicylic acid patent a few years afterwards; specialisation 
was unknown : every student was working at a different problem and everyone 
knew what everyone else was doing — we constantly discussed our doings together. 
In later years, each laboratory has had its special subject and the students 
working with this or that member of the staff, as a rule, have been pledged to 
secrecy, in case their results might turn out to be of practical value and 
patentable. The peculiar growth of a new school, that of Physical Chemistry, 
has also contributed in an unfortunate degree to a change in attitude, the 
more as it has been pledged to one particular creed. 

Mainly through the remarkable influence exercised by Ostwald, an escape 
from the artistic-literary party, whose voluminous and eloquent writings have 
had a great vogue, highly speculative doctrine has been put before students not 
tentatively and argumentatively but as absolute truth : religious doctrine ha5 
rarely been professed with greater fervour or with less regard to logic. Workers 
in this field have not only been neglectful of the organic side of chemistry 
and altogether lacking in breadth of appreciation but what is even worse — their 
fingers have not been cultivated. 

The two influences combined have deprived the German chemical school of 
salient features to which formerly it owed its pre-eminence. Fortunately, 
perhaps, we have not been successful on the commercial side but far too many 
of us have fallen victims to ionomania and the disease has had dire effects, 
particularly in biological circles : tlie text-books are so full of it that the 
infection will not easily be rooted out. 

In recent years several admirable books have been written on the ' pay your 
money and take your choice ' principle, in which the views advocated by 
A, B, &amp;c., are set down. In discussing these with friends I have been nearly 
always told : ' Oh, but you must give students some positive belief. ' To me it 
seems that unless the reasons can be stated and their sufficiency considered, we 
are not teaching anything worthy to be termed Science and in no way pro- 
moting the intellectual revolution contemplated by Huxley. 

^ As pieces of original pioneering research work in education, that done at 
the two colleges has been of great importance ; invaluable experience has been 
gained — yet no one has asked to have the work fully recorded and discussed. 
As is our English habit, having made an experiment successfully, we put our 
experience aside and start afresh on a new tack : after being a phenomenal 
success, at the end of twenty-five years, our system has been abolished at 
Kensington and a return made to easy conventional ways. NeAV forces are in 
operation ; the last thing we English can contemplate is collective and continuous 
action. 

To pass from small things to great, we once had a Science and Art Depart- 
ment : it was brought into being, with the assistance of Prince Albert, by the 
late Lord Playfair, who did everything possible, throughout his life, to secure 
its efficiency; Huxley, Sir John Donnelly and Sir William Abney raised it to a 
high level ; now it is all but abandoned. 

Once, in earlv vears, the School Board for London had on its Council a man

distinguished from most others in the country by the completeness of their 
obligatory courses and by holding an entrance examination, which all students 
entering upon such courses were required to pass, as well as by the efforts that 
were made to consider the capabilities of the students and to meet their 
requirements. 

My views were first made public in 1884, when a scheme of instruction was put 
forward which was eventually developed into that known as the heuristic 
method. My experience of the method has been gained both in my own school 
and by watching its application by my pupils and others in a variety 
of schools — by Messrs. Gordon and Heller in schools under the School Board 
for London ; by Mr. W. M. Heller, of late years, on a very large scale in Irish 
elementary schools ; in a number of girls' schools ; in Christ's Hospital school ; 
and during over twenty years in one of the most successful modern secondary 
schools in the country, where my four sons have been educated, which has 
grown up at my doors, under a head-master who has been a warm advocate 
of heuristic teaching. 

The subject is discussed so fully in my book on ' The Teaching of Scientific 
Method' (Macmillan &amp; Co., London, 1903; 2nd ed. 1911) that it is unneces- 
sary to say anything of the method, beyond pointing out that it involves put- 
ting the learner in the position of inquirer and insisting that the purpose with 
which an experiment is made shall be fully appreciated before it is carried 
out and that the bearing of the result on the question asked at the beginning 
shall be fully considered — each successive experiment being devised to promote 
the solution of the problem undertaken and to justify the solution arrived at. 
One feature of the work is the stress laid on an account being written of the 
work in proper literary form, stage by stage, as the inquiry is carried on : the 
art of making experiments is the one before all others to be cultivated by such 
work; therefore it is essential that a statement of the motive with which an 
experiment is made shall be written out before proceeding. 

The results obtained either by myself or through the agency of those whom 
I have trained have been most encouraging ; but it has only been too obvious 
that those who attempt to put it in practice, after they have been under the 
influence of didactic and dogmatic teaching, have the greatest difficulty in ac- 
quiring the right habit of mind, so that, probably, not many teachers have really 
learnt to appreciate the method and its possibilities : it is one that involves too 
much thinking to please the majority ; thinking is always troublesome work. 
But the movement has had an influence in many quarters and has even affected 
literary subjects : an ideal has been introduced into teaching the application of 
which is new, though it is not new in principle. Our conventional method of 
teaching is not one which favours the development of an inquiring habit — we 
give demonstrations and we call upon students to verify statements that are 
made to them ; but we are so occupied in stating results, that we do not explain 
how the results were arrived at and what led up to them. As a rule, 
only those who have done research work know what constitutes an experiment. 

My own experience with students has satisfied me that they not only vary 
in ability but that the different classes are of very different types of mind : 
the engineer tends to be constructive but not analytical ; the analytical intro- 
spective habit of mind is more highly developed in the chemist; the biologist 
rarely has mathematical proclivities. 

It is useless to attempt to teach all in the same way and many can learn 
only very little. 

The explanation of Huxley's failure to forecast the future of Science lies, 
apparently, in the fact that men generally are. not attuned to her ways. I am 

of sterling worth, who was a whole-hearted believer in Science — the late 
Dr. Gladstone : under his influence a most important and successful beginning 
was made to give very elementary lessons in scientific method in the schools ; 
the experiment came to 'an end even before his death : the work done by the 
teacher was so highly appreciated that he was attracted elsewhere and had no 
proper successor. 

We seem, in all things, to depend on some one man : it will rest with Science 
to remedy this disability from which we suffer so much. 



620 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION L. 

inclined to think that the ' mere man of letters ' wiU continue to ignore and 
despise Science — he will lack the peculiar mental capacity to assimilate scientific 
teaching. Only the few will rise to a proper understanding of the mysteries 
and be masters of their subjects, though many may be trained to be skilful 
mechanics. 

The extent to which the multitude can receive instruction is a matter of 
primary importance. If, as Huxley has said, the greatest intellectual revolu- 
tion mankind has yet seen is now slowly taking place by the agency of Science — 
if she be teaching the world that the ultimate court "of appeal is observation 
and experiment, not authority ; teaching it the value of evidence : then must 
we strive to teach all, in some measure, what constitutes evidence, what observa- 
tion and experiment are. 

I believe much can be done in this direction, having made the attempt 
with hundreds of unwilling students in my time, students of Engineering who 
had not only made up their minds that they were not going to learn 
Chemistry as it was not their subject but were incapable of ever entering 
into the spirit of the work— one of my sons was amongst them. At an early 
period, having realised that it was useless to waste my time and theirs in 
the struggle and that it would not help them, in the long run, to give 
them Chemical tips which they lacked the sense to appreciate and to apply, 
1 made up my mind that it was desirable instead, if possible, to develop any 
detective or inventive spirit that might be in them, so advised them to 
read detective stories instead of a text-book and ask themselves what the stories 
taught them : how the detectives set to work. Their attention was secured by 
urging them also to think what would be their position, later in life, when they 
were called upon to act for themselves and to get new knowledge for themselves, 
if they had not learnt to think for themselves. We have then set them to work 
to solve a series of problems in the laboratory. The course, in fact, was a 
combined laboratory-lecture course, the lectures being on and always subsequent 
to the laboratory work. In not a few cases, in after years, when I have met 
old students, they have told me spontaneously that, much as they had objected 
to tlie pressure put upon them, our insistence on tlieir learning to do something 
themselves had proved to be of extreme value. Long experience has con- 
vinced me that anyone who has once learnt to make simple measurements and 
observations and to ask and answer a definite question experimentally is on a 
different mental and moral plane from that occupied by those who have had no 
such training. 

Such teaching is possible even in elementary schools — given competent 
teachers ; but a new race of teachers will be required to carry the work into 
effect, should it be decided to make the attempt at all generally. 

The great mistake that has been made hitherto is that of attempting to teach 
the elements of this or that special branch of Science : what we should seek 
to do is to impart the elements of scientific method and inculcate wisdom, so 
choosing the material studied as to develop an intelligent appreciation of what 
is going on in the world. It must be made clear, in every possible way, that 
Science is not a mere body of doctrine but a method : that its one aim is the 
pursuit of truth. 

If we are to progress in these matters, a system must soon be developed which 
is broader and better than that under which we now muddle along — at present 
the real problems of education are all but neglected ; even if the official mind 
were capable and desirous of promoting progress, the work of administering 
rules and regulations — of keeping the machine going — is so great that no time 
is left for thought. 

To accomplish our purpose we need to introduce higher ideals into our 
University life — the ideals that have long governed the German Universities. 
In place of the worship of mere knowledge, we must put those of understanding 
;ind application and seek to teach all, as far as possible, to appreciate the art 
of discovery — to value and promote inquiry and discussion : to exercise a 
reasonable logic, in fact. 

We have seen the error of our ways sufficiently to give up payment by results 
;ind are all but ashamed that we were ever misled by Robert Lowe to adopt such 
a soul-killing policy. But none the less our entire educational system is still in 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION L. G21 

the grips of commercialism and, in this respect, as a nation, we stand alone, 
[ believe. Scholarships, prizes of one kind or another, examinations are the 
perpetual feast of British education. Examinations, in fact, are a regularised 
and very lucrative branch of industry — mostly in the hands of certain firms 
who diplomatically shelter themselves under the aegis of this or that educa- 
tional body ; but the Universities are the greatest sinners. Valuable as examina- 
tions may be within certain narrow limits and for certain definite purposes, there 
is little doubt that our general ignorance is in no small degi-ee determined by 
our worship of the examination fetish. So long as the system prevails, the 
education of our youth will not be in accordance either with their capacity or 
their requirements but on lines corresponding to those by which prize cattle are 
raised for show — they will be trained to develop some specially catching point. 

The examinations are an inheritance from the literary rule. It is possible to 
test on paper whether a man be ' well read ' but faculty as distinct from capacity 
cannot be so determined. What is worse, by forcing students to commit a large 
body of doctrine to memory, the attention becomes fixed merely upon what 
others have done and little time or inclination is left them to acquire a know- 
ledge of method — the faculty of thinking for themselves and applying their 
knowledge. No class suffer more seriously than medical students under tho 
system — their preliminary training is all but entirely didactic and the time 
spent upon it all but wasted : we need not wonder that medicine has made so 
little advance, the practitioners being in no way trained in the usq of scientific 
method. 

That we should so long have suffered so futile a system to prevail is incom- 
prehensible. German higher education has achieved marvellous results without 
any such provision of rewards and prizes as ours and has given breadth to the 
nation in consequence; in fact, science in Germany is all but a household word, 
as every family in the educated classes has one or more of its members trained 
at the University and the primary function of the Universities is to inculcate 
a knowledge of method : they insist that all who take their degrees shall have 
inklings of the art of inquiry, not mere knowledge. 

To improve our educational system we need to get rid of our blind British 
belief in 'men of affairs,' especially in the 'man of business,' so-called, really 
the man of commerce, as persons capable of ordering everybody's affairs and 
everybody's business. The commercial man, the financier or the lawyer, would 
never think of calling us in to manage his proper business — why should he be 
thought competent to manage ours? Results show that he is not, as my 
argiiment in this address would lead us to expect would be the case. 

No one will seek, for one moment, to minimise the progi-ess made or fail to 
recognise that infinite credit is due to those who have controlled the work of 
education thus far; hitherto, however, progress has been made in providing 
accommodation and getting scholars to school and college : the art of teaching 
has made no corresponding advance — nor will it, I believe, until the onus is 
cast more directly upon the teachers and they are forced to exercise greater 
forethought in the direction of collective action — until they are placed in a 
position to be sole managers of their own affairs and called upon to row together 
as entirely self-chosen crews. At home, excepting at our ancient Universities, 
' Governing Bodies ' are paramount everywhere — not the teachers : and too often 
the sense of responsibility and power of initiative of the teacher are further 
diminished by the interposition of a Principal, who may be a man of all affairs 
except that in hand — the work of teaching. If rumour speak truly, the College 
President is too often the bar to progress in the United States of America. 
It is well known that the exercise of responsibility promotes thought and begets 
the sense and power of accepting responsibility — the opposite is none the less 
true. 

Personally, I have had special experience as to what can be done under a 
system involving collective action and have had foretastes of what might be 
done bj' sympathetic interlocking and correlation of courses : I have no doubt of 
its superiority : nevertheless, I recognise that such co-operative action may be 
' agin Nature.' 

In some way, we must learn to debate our doings more freely and not to 
flinch at fair criticism. Whatever the faults of our English public school

education, one of its many advantages is tliat boys who go through it are 
disciplined to stand the kicks of the world without too much complaining : 
this is one of the marks of the gentleman. Such training is not easily given in 
the day school and no little difficulty is experienced, I am told, by employers 
of labour nowadays, on account of the way in which the least criticism, even the 
suggestion that there may be a better way of doing a thing, is liable to be 
resented and interpreted as fault-finding by those in their employ. 

If the conclusion at which I have arrived be correct — that science is not 
for the multitude and can never be generally appreciated or even fashionable — in 
view of the part which it is clearly destined to play in education and in daily 
life, on account of its infinite and far-reaching influence upon our well-being 
— the responsibility cast upon the few representatives of science is very great : 
in support of our civilisation and in order tliat wisdom may prevail more 
generally, they must organise its forces effectively. 

Whilst individuality is the mainspring of scientific progress, collective action 
is required to provide full and proper opportunity for the workers and to 
promote the success of their inquiries. At present, scientific workers are 
organised merely for the purpose of providing means of publishing the results 
of their studies, in no way either for defence or offence : our Societies are 
not effective even for the purposes of debate and criticism. Thus, our chief 
English scientific Society, consisting of some 500 members representative of all 
the various branches of physical and biological science, is little more than 
a rabble — its Fellows are such individualists that scarce half a dozen of us 
can ever agree to work seriously together for a common purpose, and the 
irresistible influence we might exercise if we could be unanimous as to our 
objective is lost to the community. Most unfortunately the Society has no 
influence whatever either on political or on public opinion : it makes no attempt 
either to guide the public or to give dignity and importance to the cause of 
science in the eyes of the community. Its meetings are dull and its belated 
publications by no means represent the scientific activity of its Fellows. - The 
Presidents of the Society have too often been appointed at an age when the 
propagandist spirit is no longer paramount, when they have no particular 
scientific message left in them to deliver. And they occupy the .Chair too long : 
this arises chiefly from the fact that however clear each one of us may be that 
individually he is fully competent to hold the office, we all agree in finding 
some objection to every name that is suggested : to overcome this difficulty a 
short tenure is desirable, so that the compliment can be paid and encouragement 
given to the various sciences in turn; no one should be appointed to such an 
office who is more than 60-65 years old, as most of us have used up our ideas and 
have lost our virility by that age. The other officers also hold their positions 
too long but members of the Council have far too short a life — consequently all 
the power is centred in the official body ; attempts that have been made to 
organise the whole Society in sections representative of the various sciences have 
always been defeated by the official party. 

Unless our scientific societies can be made more generally effective, if 
scientific workers are incapable of learning lessons from administrative life, it 
stands to reason that the collective interests of Science and of the body scientific 
must remain unrepresented and unvoiced — to the great detriment of progress 
and of the public. 

Science must be organised, in fact, as other professions are organised, if it 
is to be an effective agent in our civilisation : the problems pressing upon us 
are of such magnitude and of such infinite importance that we can no longer 
afford to be without wisdom. 

' That there should one Man die ignorant who had capacity for Knowledge, 
this I call a Tragedy. . . . The miserable fraction of Science which an 
imited mankind, in a wide Universe of Nescience, has acquired, why is not this, 
with all diligence, imparted to all?' This question, asked long ago by our 
Chelsea sage, remains shamefully unanswered. 

Our present system is cunningly devised to keep expert advice at a distance : 
unless a row can be made or action taken which will affect votes, little can be 
done. Persons afflicted with ideas derived from long service and serious study

may obtain a lieaiiug occasionally, at meetings such as this ; a leading article or 
two may be written about their vagaries ; but the State has no use for them. 
jSievertheless, we must coutituie to rattle our drums, hoping that the noise will 
attract in course of time : — 

' The future hides in it 
Gladness and sorrow ; 
We press still thorow, 
Nothing that abides in it 
Daunting us — onward.' 

Tarry long we cannot : — 

' One moment in Annihilation's Waste, 
One moment of the Well of Life to taste— 
The Stars are setting and the Caravan 
Starts for the Dawn of Nothing — Oh, make haste ! ' 

' God, He knows we need mtn more and more in the game ! ' said the 
Mahbab to Kim. The awful war before us must inevitably prove this to be the 
case, is proving it already ; all that I have seen since I came to Australia, to my 
mind, is proof to the same effect. As Prince von liiilow reminds us, ' the varied 
life of a nation, ever changing, ever growing more complicated, cannot be 
stretched or squeezed to fit a programme or a political principle.' The future 
of tbis Continent must depend on training bemg given that will educate and 
provide real men, not softlings and town-dwellers merely. 



The following Papers were then read : — 

1. State Aid for Science: A Retrospect. By C. A. Buckmasteb. 

An attempt was made to show in what ways and to what extent the State 
has provided funds for the promotion of Science during the past sixty years, 
to trace the variations in amount and manner from year to year, and to see 
what general conclusions, if any, can be drawn from the results. 

The sums voted in the Estimates presented to Parliament were taken as a 
basis, and classified under the two heads of Aid given to Science Instruction and 
Aid given for the promotion of Scientific Research. 

The first of these was again divided into the assistance given to Science 
teaching in connection with Elementary, Secondary, University, and Technical 
Education respectively. 

The part played by the various Government Departments in this distribution 
of public funds was indicated, and the effect of this variety on the results of the 
investigation noted. 

Finally the evidence of increase or decrease both in amount and interest was 
examined and the general results of the inquiry summarised. 



2. Mathematics and Science as Part of a Liberal Education. 
By W. D. Eggar. 

The methods of teaching the elements of these subjects have been discussed 
almost ad nauseam during the last thirteen years and perhaps longer, the main 
starting-point being the meeting of the British Association in Glasgow in 19U1. 
It is not the object of the writer of the paper to question the merits of the 
changes of method either in Mathematics or Science. The immediate cause of 
the changes has been the change in the character of examinations. Examina- 
tions, and, in particular, the school-leaving examination, must always determine 
the nature and extent of the school teaching. The accepted view is that a boy 
who has passed this examination has obtained a satisfactory general grounding, 
and is capable of ' specialising,' as it is called, in Mathematics, Science, Classics, 
History, Modern Languages, or, at the University, in Law, or Theology, or 
Metaphysics. 

It is maintained by the writer that the Mathematics required by all these 



624 TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION L. 

qualifying examinations are either too little or too much. From the purely 
utilitarian standpoint, the standpoint which is now almost universal, it is only 
the man in a scientific profession who wants anything more than plain Arithmetic. 
From the aesthetic standpoint every educated man wants something better than 
simultaneous quadratics, which mark the superior limit in Algebra. The modern 
classical Sixth Form boy misses tlie old logical training of Euclid, which after 
all did appeal to and intluence the clever ones, and has now been replaced by a 
hotch potch in which any proof of a theorem is accepted which is good enough 
for an engineer. 

The conditions in science teaching are somewhat similar. Here again, every- 
thing has been sacrificed to the average stupid boy : the average clever boy is 
disregarded. The boy without imagination must have everything presented to 
him with an obvious utilitarian sauce. Hence Science which is not strictly useful 
but only beautiful is liable to be excluded. You will not find Astronomy and 
Sound included in many school curricula. 

Cannot we arrive at some agreement as to the number and position of the 
windows of the mind which should be opened by a liberal education? Does the 
syllabus of any School-leaving or Matriculation or Previous E.xamination open 
any '! Greek opens a window to the mind which gets as far as being able to read 
Homer and Plato without a crib and with only occasional use of the dictionary. 
Physics opens a window when wave-motion in all its forms begins to be realised ; 
the construction of a thermometer or an electroscope leaves the window shut. 
Mathematics must open many windows for those who go far enough ; but the 
tendency of the average non-mathematical boy is to regard it as a dark and dusty 
subway with no windows at all. How far must one go to come to a window ? 
The question may be asked in connection with any study ; and it might be set as 
a problem for the Recorder of each Section of this Association to assess the 
minimum of attainment which will enable the average member to follow with 
intelligent appreciation the work of that Section.

TUESDAY, AUGUST 18. 
The following Papers were read : — 
1. The London Trade Schools. By C. W. Kimmins, M.A., D.Sc. 

lu order to place the subject of trade schools in its appropriate setting it is 
necessary to know something of the London County Council's elaborate scholar- 
ship scheme, consisting of junior, intermediate, and senior scholarships, which 
makes ample provision for the very clever child from the elementary school to the 
secondary school and the University or higher technical school. 

After thus making provision for the clever child the problem of problems 
becomes : How can we prevent the boy and girl of normal intelligence from 
drifting into the ranks of unskilled labour on leaving the elementary school at 
the age of fourteen ? In order to bridge over the serious gap between the ages 
of fourteen and seventeen the trade school has come into existence, and is 
destined in the future to play a very important part in London education. It has 
been found that for the poor type of child it is, under present conditions, quite 
impossible to ensure two or three years' continuous instruction after the age of 
fourteen unless some grant for maintenance is made which will recoup the 
parents for the loss they sustain by not letting their children enter unskilled 
employment. The trade school scholarship for boys generally consists of free 
education and a maintenance grant of 6/. for the first year and 151. for the second 
and third years. 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION L. 625 

The establishment of the trade school is^ moreover, largely due to the changed 
conditions of modern industry and the total disappearance in some, and the gradual 
disappearance in others, of the apprenticeship system in many of the London 
industries. Most of the trade scholarships for boys are awarded in engineering, 
silversmithing and jewellery, book-production, furniture and cabinet-making, 
carriage-building, photo-engraving and photo-process work, professional cookery, 
waiting, and wood-carving, and for the different branches of the building trades. 
In many other trades, such as tailoring and bakery and confectionery, definite 
trade instruction is given, but no scholarships are awarded for these subjects. 
The net cost, apart from loan charges, in a boys' trade school is about 151. to 211. 
per head. 

The sciliolarships awarded to girls are for trade dress-making, laundry work, 
upholstery, ladies' tailoring, waistcoat-making, corset-making, millinery, design- 
ing and making of wholesale costumes, and photography. As a rule, trade 
scholarships for girls are for a period of two years, with a maintenance grant of 
8/. for the first year and 121. for the second year, in addition to free education. 
The net cost in a trade school for girls is about 15?. per girl. 

In order to ensure that trade scholarships are given only to children of 
parents who are unable to maintain their children at school without assistance, 
no candidate is eligible whose parents or guardians are in receipt of an income 
which exceeds 160?. a year from all sources. 

In many ways the trade school has a distinct advantage over the old system of 
apprenticeship : — 

(1) The supervision in a well-equipped trade school is generally of a much 
more efficient kind than even that of a well-ordered workshop. 

(2) Culture subjects are not neglected, and consequently the general education 
of the boys or girls is continued in a manner suitable to the trade for which they 
are preparing. 

(3) In the apprenticeship system there is a natural tendency for the appren- 
tice to become attached to some special department of the work, to the serious 
neglect of others. 

(4) In following out a definite curriculum under a well-arranged time-table 
there is very little waste of time and the balance of theoretical and practical 
work is properly maintained. 

(5) The W'Ork of a trade school is generally governed by a consultative com- 
mittee of experts who are to a large extent responsible for the education of the 
students being carried on under the best trade conditions. 

(6) The pretence of trade experts with experience of teaching, wiho are 
always at hand in the trade school workshop and able to solve any difficulties 
which may arise, means an enormous saving of time as compared with the case of 
the apprentice who has to await the convenience of the foreman for the solution 
of diificulties. 

A most important element in the success of the trade schools is the connec- 
tion of the school with the trade by means of expert consultative committees. 
The most important of these are the consultative committees in (i) bookbinding, 
(ii) book-production, (iii) goldsmithing, silversmithing, and jewellery, (iv) tailor- 
ing, and (v) furnishing trades. These committees are representative of the 
Masters' Associations, of the Workmen's Associations, and of the Council. Local 
consultative committees of experts have also been formed in the case of each 
trade in each of the girls' schools. 

In addition to the full-time trade schools there are many polytechnics and 
technical schools in London working in conjunction with employers of labour in 
connection with the technical education of their employes. Moreover, apart from 
full and part time day work admirable provision is made in all parts of London 
for evening classes in polytechnics and similar institutions in connection with the 
various trades. The enthusiasm with which thousands of young artisans, after a 
long day's work, will attend for theoretical and practical instruction in the 
scientific principles of their trades under skilled craftsmen is one of the mast 
pleasing features in London education.

3. The Compulsory Education of Youth. 
By Professor J. J. Findlay, Ph.D., M.A. 

1. Up to the era of the Industrial Revolution all races, savage and civilised, 
held the youth of both sexes up to eighteen j'ears of age in control and educated 
them (although only a few were kept at school). The introduction of the factory 
and of wholesale traffic has created a youthful proletariat, emancipated by earn- 
ing wages from control either by the family, the Church, or the civic guild. 

2. The consequent evil is accentuated [a) by the artificial conditions under 
which the period of childhood is passed in schools : ahording few experiences 
adequate to prepare for precocious emancipation ; [b) physical conditions of city 
life; (c) opportunities for cheap luxury presenting temptations to idleness and 
waste— the cinema perhaps the last word in this story; [d) the enormously 
increased demand for monotonous labour which youth can undertake even better 
than older people. 

3. Remedies to be .sought by noting how the youth in families of larger 
means are nowadays educated : — ■ 

(a) Youth needs social experience; the family and the Secondary Schools 
together provide opportunities for corporate life appropriate to this period of 
development. The parallel to this among the proletariat is found in Lads' Clubs, 
the Boy Scout movement, and similar organisations by institutional churches in 
the slums of large cities; but these cannot claim control over the youth. With 
a selected few they provide outlet for the imagination and foster ideals. 

(b) Youth needs instruction. The Secondary School for the leisured class, 
the Trade School for the artizan class, need their counterpart in plans for partial 
instruction during a few hours in each week compulsorily imposed on all, and 
taken during the day-time. This is most effective when associated with employ- 
ment in commerce or manufacture, for youth profits by the discipline of hard 
work. The Evening Continuation School has failed to reach the great mass of 
those who need instruction, but has pointed the way to a more comprehensive 
reform. 

(c) Youth needs vocational guidance and the personal interest of older folk. 
The family and the school unite to supply this for the more fortunate classes. 
Labour Bureaus and the like are beginning to supply it for the proletariat. 

4. The organisation needed must make united provision for these three needs. 
It must be set in motion by the State, since the family and the trade have lost the 
compulsory authority which they formerly exercised; and the State alone can 
interfere on behalf of the youth with the vested interests of capital and labour. 
The outcome will be seen in a new type of institution ; and a new type of teacher, 
who will be the guide and friend of youth as well as a ' continuation ' instructor. 
Exam2oles are already to hand in the efforts made by a few large employers of 
adolescent labour in Europe and America : the State as an employer of such 
labour has hitherto done little. Reform will only be effective when the social 
conscience of the community is aroused in large cities so as to support the 
Legislature in accepting the principle of partial control over wage-earning youth.

(A general discussion relating especially to Victorian experience followed, in

6. Moral Education. By W. E. Boyce Gibson. 

1. Moral instruction has this distinctive characteristic, that it touches the 
interest on its practical side where the life of ideas is intimately one with the 
life of sentiment and will. Its appeal is to the personal reason, and the ideas 
which it stimulates into activity become directive forces of the personal life. 
Hence moral instruction stands on a different platform from instruction in the 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION L. 627 

sciences. The ideas we acquire concerning the stars do not modify or otherwise 
affect their movements. They simply affect our knowledge of their movements. 
But the ideas we acquire concerning our own behaviour may affect not only our 
knowledge of that behaviour but the behaviour itself. 

2. The ideas awakened through moral instruction will tend to act themselves 
out, and in thus enacting themselves provide the natural opportunity for moral 
t}-aining. Thus moral instruction and moral training are intimately connected as 
stages in the completed process of moral education. 

3. Since the moral ideas emerge from the depths of the personal life, we shall 
find it hard on any vital definition of religion to sever moral ideas from their 
religious setting or moral from religious instruction. In any case it seems inad- 
visable to sever the two in advance in an artificial way. Teaching that is scrupu- 
lously ethical may if it reach deep enough become profoundly religious in its 
appeal whilst still remaining wholly non-theological and non-sectarian. In our 
view the exclusion of the child's most natural treasiiry of morals, the Bible, 
from courses of moral instruction intended to promote the child's good cannot be 
logically defended, though it may on lesser grounds be judged expedient. 

4. In discussing the conditions of moral instruction it w^ould conduce to 
clearness if interests were considered in the following order : (1) the child's, 
(2) the teacher's, (3) the interests of parents and churches. No solution could, 
of course, be regarded as anything but provisional which did not satisfy all the 
essential interests involved. 

5. Admitting the view of Professor Sadler that ' the question of moral educa- 
tion is the heart of the modern educational problem,' and that ' if this is 
neglected, education is a peril,' the conclusion of the late International Inquiry 
dealing with moral instruction and training in schools, that in all public 
elementary schools at least one lesson a week should be devoted to moral instruc- 
tion can hardly be considered extravagant. 

6. The main part to be played by philosophy in assisting moral education 
seems to lie (1) in the psychological investigation and analysis of the life and 
mentality of childhood, (2') in the discussion of the problems and requirements 
of social ethics, (3) in the organising of a Weltanschatuing in the light of which 
educational ideals in general and those of moral education in particular may be 
brought into helpful relations to each other and to the rest of life.

6. The Teaching of Botany. By Miss L. J. Clabke. 



7. The Teaching of Domestic Subjects in Primary Schools. 
By Mrs. C. M. Meredith. 

The inclusion of any subject in the primary school curriculum needs careful 
justification because of the limited time available. Each subject must either be 
useful in the sense that it is to be of service later on, or educational, or both. 
The domestic subjects are generally regarded as both ; but they would probably 
not be selected on educational gi-ounds alone. Hence it is important to realise 
exactly what useful result is arrived at and to base the teaching upon this. 
This aim may be best described as preparation for the more intelligent manage- 
ment of a home, and the teaching should therefore not occupy too much time to 
the neglect of general education, nor should it be isolated from other subjects 
which, e.r/., provide for amusement and the occupation of leisure. Finally, 
'housecraft' should be the subject, to which cooking, sewing, &amp;c., are sub- 
ordinate. 

The main difficulties in teaching housecraft are : (a) that the conditions in 
school are often too unlike those in the girl's future home. Something is now 
being done to avoid this, but a complete solution is impossible as long as slum 
conditions still prevail in many working-class homes. 

{!)) That the child has no adequate motive for her work. This is more 

s s 2 



628 TRANSACTIOMS OF SECTION L. 

important than (a), and more difficult to meet, but the following motives can be 
appealed to : — • 

(1) The play motive, which is at present only made use of in young children. 

(2) The desire to 'help ' and to do ' real work.' 

(3) The love of simplified or primitive life. 

We want to arouse something of the boy scout attitude, which includes. a 
little of all the above motives.

WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 19. 
The following Papers were read :- — 

1. The Trainhig of the Teacher. By Dr. John Smyth. 

This paper specially emphasised : — 

(1) (n) The value of giving young teachers the right ideal; (/;) The steps 
in the art of teaching; (c) The value of experimental work and especially of 
experimental schools both in the training of the teacher and in the development 
of all teachers. 

(2) It is well that a student before beginning systematic professional training 
should : — (a) have spent six months or a year in the observation and practice of 
teaching so as to become acquainted with its problems and difficulties; (6) have 
completed his course of academic training. 

(3) It is well for all three classes of student-teachers : Kindergarten, Primary, 
Secondary, to be trained at the same institution ; or, if this be not possible, to 
learn something of one anotlier's work. A special course of training should be 
given to intending Rural School teachers. 

(4) The training of the teacher naturally divides into three related parts ; — • 
The Ideal, Culture and Knowledge, Professional Training. The Ideal may be 
shortly defined as the spiritual vision of the part to be played by the school in 
the upbuilding of national life. It is more important than knowledge, and in 
some ways more important than professional skill. It begets enthusiasm, 
awakens sympathy with children, and becomes the parent of many virtues. 
Culture is more valuable than knowledge, as it means at least the kindling of 
love and appreciation and may mean much more. 

(5) The Professional Training of the teacher divides itself into three parts : — 
(a) the lectures on the philosophy, history, administration, principles, and 
methods of education; (b) the observation of and efforts at acquiring skill in 
teaching; (c) the use of experimental work. The first of these may be passed 
over at present. 

(6) With reference to the acquirement of skill the problem for our time is 
to reduce it by scientific investigation into a series of gradations, and to analyse 
the whole process into its elements. It will be found that these steps will vary 
somewhat for each type of student and will be different according as the age 
is. The elements combining in the perfected result will be the same; and 
ultimately have all to be mastered, but they may be gained in different ways. 
Students should be divided into types or classes according to their degree of con- 
fidence, their sympathy with children, and their connectedness of thought and 
speech. Modifications as to the length of time spent on observation and the mode 
of attack will depend on the grade of teaching for which preparation is being 
made and on the academic training completed. 

(7) The Art of Teaching may be analysed into : — Confidence, planning a 
lesson, connectedness of thought and speech, sympathy with children, use of 
illustration, eye and ear power, questioning, disciplinary power. The first 
three are necessary from the beginning, but each of the others need not be con- 
sciously cultivated till the preceding ones have been more or less acquired. The 
development of power in each should continue to grow consciously step by step 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION L. 629 

till ultimately all combine in enabling the teacher at every moment to place him- 
self alongside the conscious effort of each individual child and to be fertile in 
resource to help him. 

(8) Experimental work will be the basis and crown of future training. By 
his laboratory work the student will get a new view of psychology and child- 
study, and from the experimental schools he will see new vistas of productive 
effort and inquiry in method, curricula, correlation, &amp;c. It will compel him 
to be a better teacher, for only the skilful and sympathetic can investigate the 
recesses of the child mind. 

(9) Experimental schools in connection with Teachers' Colleges are as neces- 
sary for Education Departments and for all teachers as for the students. They 
will set new views of the teaching art before teachers and re-awaken zeal and 
enthusiasm in many. They will be able to demonstrate what correlations can 
be made, what curricula may be taught, and what methods should be followed. 
They will substitute scientific certainty for dogmatic opinion or scattered 
observations, and will give the Teaching Art a new status in the community.

Papers were read : — 

1. Training of Teachers in New South Wales. 
By Professor A. Mackie, M.A. 

Prior to 1906 training for teaching was by means of apprenticeship. Boys 
and girls after the completion of the primary course were apprenticed as pupil- 
teachers for a period of four years. On the completion of apprenticeship a 
small number passed into one or other of the two training-colleges. The 
majority, however, were appointed without further training as assistants in 
State schools, and thereafter rose to the higher positions partly by length of 
service, experience, and competency, and partly by sitting for the teachers' 
examination. In the training-colleges the course was short — after one year of 
training the students passed out as trained teachers and took their place as 
assistants. 

Growing dissatisfaction with this method of providing a supply of teachers 
was felt for reasons similar to those operating in England and Scotland about 
the same time. General dissatisfaction with the school organisations led to a 
commission being sent to Europe. The report of this commission was the 
immediate cause of the re-organisation of the educational system which has 
been proceeding ever since. Further, a syllabus of primary instruction prepared 
by Mr. Board when he became Under-Secretary in 1905 made it clear that a 
higher standard of qualification was necessary for teachers. 

Guiding principles determining the reshaping of the course of training for 
teachers were : — 

(n) The abolition of apprenticeship or the pupil-teacher system. 

{h) College training for all teachers to be employed in the State service. 

(r) Longer courses of training than had hitherto been customary. 



630 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION L. 

Since 1906 progress has been steady towards the realisation of these aims : 
in spite of the very great difficulties in staffing schools in a rapidly developing 
and widely scattered community there has been no reversion to the policy of 
employing wholly untrained persons or persons who have picked up their know- 
ledge and skill by means of apprenticeship only. 

The Devdoinnent of Teachers' College. 

In 1905 the two colleges were abolished. A single non-residential college 
for men and women was established in temporary quarters. 

Up till 1913 a special entrance examination was held for admission to tlie 
college, and since 1910 candidates who had passed the University Matriculation 
Examination were admitted without further examination. 

At first the student body was almost wholly comjiosed of those who had 
passed through a period of apprenticeship, and, in consequence, courses had to 
be adopted to suit the needs of ex-pupil-teachers. But gradually the supply of 
jjuijil-teachers became exhausted, and their place was taken by probationary 
students. These were boys and girls passing through a course of secondary 
training at a High School or District School. During the last two years of 
this course these probationary students were in receipt of scholarships given to 
assist them in preparing for the work of teaching. During the last two years 
of their probationary students' course the pupils received some instruction in 
teaching and some practice in giving lessons under the direction of the head 
master and mistress. The Teachers' College also took a part in the supervision 
of their practice teaching during three months prior to entrance to college. 

When the High School courses were reorganised it was decided that the 
supply of teachers should in future be drawn from those who had completed 
a four-year course of secondary work. The entrance qualification is now the 
possession of a Leaving Certificate. In 1914, a transition year, a considerable 
number were admitted on completion of the first three years of High School 
work. 

The above change precludes the possibility of any preliminary training in 
teaching before admission. The High School pupil who contemplates teaching 
as his future occupation is not distracted by having to begin his specific pro- 
fessional training before his secondary course is completed. 

The changes outlined above in the character of the student body have been 
rellected in changes made from time to time in the college course. 

The students to whom reference has been made are not sufficient in number 
to supply the requirements of the teaching service. New South Wales has a 
scattered population, and this makes necessary a large number of one-teacher 
schools. Hence the supply of rural teachers is an urgent problem. The reasons 
which make it impossible to staff such schools with teachers who have had a 
four-year High School course followed by a college course of at least two 
years are partly financial, partly due to the character of rural school teaching, 
and the conditions of life in outlying settlements, and partly the result of the 
inadequacy of college accommodation at jiresent. 

In the past the rural schools were staffed by persons who after a simjale 
examination were placed in larger schools for a period of three months' prac- 
tice, and thereafter were sent to take sole charge of the small rural school. 

This method was abandoned in 1909. In 1910 the college provided a course 
of training, shorter and simpler thaii those already in operation, and intended 
to give a short period of training to the rural school teacher. A short course 
of six months' training was organised, and has since been continued. Each year 
about 250 students are trained in this way for rural schools. 

The college is organised to provide a variety of courses to meet the varied 
requirements of the State Department. The courses at present in operation are 
as follows : — 

A short course of six months prepares teachers for the small rural schools. 

A one-year course devoted solely to professional work prepares graduates 
in Arts or Science for Primary or High School teacliing. A two-year course 
prepares either for Infant or Primary teaching. Third and fourth year courses 
allow of students completing degree courses at the University or taking up some 
special branch of work. 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION h. 631 

The division of time between the two parts of the college training — the 
academic and the professional — varies according to tlie course. The general 
tendency is to increase the amount of professional work as the college entrance 
standard rises. But the shorter courses are more predominantly professional 
than the longer. Further, the practice is adopted of putting the professional 
training towards the end of the longer courses. 

Teacliing Pracdre for all students in attendance is provided for in the 
Sydney schools. A large number of schools arc made use of in order that only 
a few may be attached to each school. While engaged in practice-teaching, each 
group of students is under direction of a member of the college staff who acts as 
supervisor of practice-teaching. 

Some years ago considerable opposition existed to the plan of training 
teachers without preliminary apprenticeship. Experience does not seem to have 
justified the fears entertained. No doubt the young teacher, like the young 
medical man, requires a period of practice to make him a competent practi- 
tioner. This is secured partly by requiring a fairly long period of continuous 
practice immediately antecedent to exit from college, and partly by the pro- 
bationary period prior to issue of the teacher's certificate of competence. The 
evidence available goes to show that High School and college training followed 
by a period of probation produces practitioners of at least good quality as did 
the apprenticeship system. 

The immediate future development will consist in carrying into effect the 
principles already indicated. The short course of training will be increased 
from six to twelve months. A larger proportion of the students will enter 
after completing a sound secondary schooling. The college courses will become 
still more professional in character. 

Under the direction of the college are two Demonstration Schools, the head 
teachers of which hold the position of lecturers in education on the college 
staff. A small amount of experimental work is carried out in these schools, 
some of which has been published. 

From time to time the college publishes monographs of educational interest. 
These are mainly the work of members of the college staff. The stimulus of 
such work is considerable, and efforts are made to allow those members of the 
staff who undertake investigations the leisure necessary for carrying them out.

and Professor J. A. Gheen took part.) 



2. Problems and Methods in Russian Experimental Pedagogics. 
By Professor A. Netschajeff, Ph.D. 

There is no administrative unity in Russian education. The Ministries of 
War, Commerce, Public Instruction, Agriculture, and Benevolent Institutions 
all have educational responsibilities, and the Orthodox Church adds to the 
complicated list of administrative authorities. This want of unity leads to 
difficulties in practice, e.g., the transition from primary to secondary school is 
very difficult. Public opinion moves in the direction of a single type of school 
of general education for all children. 

The autocratic regime of ministers has led to many ups and downs in 
education, but the fact that repression in one JVIinistry might be contem- 
poraneous with advance in another has had compensating effects. In recent 
years the Ministry of Commerce has been particularly active in the encourage- 
ment it has offered to private initiative and experiment in education. 

Public educational movements began in Russia under Catharine II., due 
largely to the influence of Comenius and Locke. The first university in Russia 
(Moscow) was founded in 1755, and at first middle and lower schools were con- 
trolled by university professors. This ended with the establishment of a 
Ministry of Education, and, under a rather barren officialism, the schools 
became simply imitators of their Western neighbours. 

Under Alexander II. new ideals came into being. They were voiced by 
IT.sliiiisky and Pirogoff, who urged the establishment of Chairs of Pedagogy in 



632 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION L. 

the universities and the scientific study of children. Then followed the period 
of reaction under Alexander III. The Ministry of Education reduced all its 
schools to a formal type. Individuality was repressed. The system was 
vigorously attacked, and finally it was officially admitted that reform was 
necessary. Active propaganda continues. It has taken many forms, with only 
one of which it is possible to deal here — experimental pedagogics. 

Contrary to Tolstoi and his claim for absolute freedom for the child, the 
psychological investigator thinks the child needs help in the process of learning 
to understand himself ; and in order to render that help it is the teacher's first 
dutj' to learn to understand the child as a phase in the process of the biological 
development of man. 

In 1901 the first laboratory of experimental psychology was opened in 
Russia at the Pedagogical Museum of the Military Schools. This has become 
the centre of scientific pedagogy in Russia. Out of this institution have developed 
the Pedagogical Academy (1907), and a Society of Experimental Pedagogics 
(1908), which conducts a four-year course of study, and carries on an experi- 
mental school. Professor Bechtereff founded in 1908 the Psycho-Neurological 
Institute in St. Petersburg, and Dr. Rossolimo founded the Institute of 
Children's Psychology and Neurology in Moscow. Numerous congresses have 
been held, and 131 schools and societies have purchased a cabinet of simple 
psychological apparatus for experimental purposes. 

The chief problem under investigation during the last fifteen years has been 
concerned with the changes in the moral life of children as depending upon 
age, sex, and educational environment. Changes in memory and association 
have been carefully studied. The general results offer striking evidence in 
favour of co-education. The study of attention and liability to fatigue con- 
firmed this result. Suggestibility, the relation of amount of sleep to intensitv of 
work and the like, have also been the subject of research. 

Further, the specific quality of fatigue induced by special kinds of work 
have been studied with a view to discovering the best possible balance in the 
sequence of short exercises. We have also been engaged upon the problem 
of individual memory types in relation to economy in methods of teaching, and 
the possibility of improving the naturally weaker sides of individual memory. 
The ' natural ' method of teaching foreign languages has been carefully investi- 
gated with a view to determining the respective place to be given {a) to the 
mother tongue and (6) to pictures in that work. 

Lastly, we have been engaged in comparing the teachers' judgments of 
children as 'attentive,' 'interested,' 'progressing,' with their performances under 
stricter laboratory methods and conditions. 

The work of Dr. Rossolimo and Professor Lazoursky in characterology should 
also be mentioned. 

These researches have all taken their rise in the laboratory, passed thence 
to the school, and finally come back to the laboratory again. This triple 
process seems to us absolutely essential.

3. School Training for Public Life. 
By Ihe Eev. H. B. Gr.\y, D.D. 

Educational methods and practice have been up to the last twenty-five years 
empirical in England. The science of pedagogy has only recently come on to the 
horizon and is still in its infancy. Traditional subjects have occupied the atten- 
tion of schoolmasters even on the highest rungs of the educational ladder, and 
have been accepted as the groundwork of educational faith, notwithstanding the 
conclusions of thinkers like Pestalozzi, Rousseau, and Froebel abroad. 

Education, which in Germany and the United States has long been welcomed 
as a great national asset, has in these islands been regarded as little less than a 
bore. The evolutionary theories of Darwin have, however, gradually penetrated the 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION L. 633 

domain of pcdagogv. It has been discovered anion.:; other things that the body 
and mind are inseparably interconnected, and that tlie evolution of the cliild lias 
as its prototype the evo'lution of the race; secondly, that the higher we go up 
the scale of cre&lt;ation, the more vast is the difference between the infant and the 
adult life, and that hence arises not only the capacity but the necessity of 
education to man as distinguished from the 'lower animals. This necessity begins 
from the cradle onwards, and the training of childhood in the informal education 
of the home becomes infinitely important. These theories, however, can only be 
touched upon in passing, as" the special subject of the Paper is the school or 
formal training for public life. 

Success and value in public life presuppose a well-balanced and ordered educa- 
tion. Such an education can only be gained by a due balance between the study 
of the works of Nature and the works of man, between linguistic and literary 
subjects on the one hand, and mathematical and natural-scientific subjects on the 
other. The adolescent who has been trained in the one to the exclusion of the 
other emerges as a narrow man. This pedagogic principle has been but slowly 
recognised in our ancient universities and historic public schools, which have 
derived their curricula by long tradition from the ecclesiastical seminaries of four 
centuries ago, although the Humani.sts were regarded originally as the foes of 
the Church. The persistence of class interests and class prejudices in England 
has kept this tradition alive, long after a philosophic pedagogy recognised its 
inherent unwisdom. 

A long race of schoolmasters also, trained on the narrow ancient methods, has 
perpetuated the superstition, and has not yet by any means shaken off the 
trammels. Their want of intellectual equipment in other subjects has been a 
collateral drawback — and this notwithstanding calls, more or less intelligent, 
from the industrial classes, and from the more progressive ideals of other 
nations. 

The devotion to literary and linguistic to the exclusion and disparagement of 
scientific studies in the curricula of our universities and schools carries with it, to 
a certain extent, a justification, inasmuch as it is undoubtedly true that concen- 
tration on the struggles and achievements of men in the past confers on the 
aspirant to public life a greater power of e.&gt;:pressing himself more clearly and 
forcibly, of impressing his views and convictions on other men. On the other 
hand, his ignorance of the laws of Nature, and want of practice in tracing from 
the laws and phenomena of the known to the laws and phenomena of the unknown, 
have a tendency to give him a narrow outlook on the social and political problems 
with which he has to deal in governing and regulating the lives and ameliorating 
the condition of his fellow-men. 

This becomes more painfully apparent when he is brought into contact with 
the phenomena of a vast and complicated Empire, and not merely of an insular 
people. It is not surprising, therefore, that the policy of our statesmen and 
public men generally has been lacking in (what may be called) imperial instinct, 
and this lack of a wide horizon may constitute a real danger to the future 
integrity and consolidation of the Empire. 

To descend, then, from the general to the particular, the youthful aspirant to 
public life ought to spend far less time in the study of the two ancient languages 
which (until the past twenty-five years) occupied more than three-quarters of the 
educational periods of the young among the governing classes. He ought to 
devote not more than one-quarter or one-sixth of his student-life to such sub- 
jects. Political and commercial geography, a thorough knowledge of one modern 
language, of English literature and European and English history, ought to be 
part of his intellectual equipment. Civics and political economy ought to be care- 
fully studied; while on the scientific side he should be taught at least the 
elements of physics and chemistry, and electricity, with a certain amount of 
general applied mathematics. The connection between mind and hand in manual 
training should also be a part of each student's equipment. 

With regard to the social side of school-life, the great weakness, both in our 
schools and universities, has been a want of large outlook. Both types of 
institutions are excellent training-grounds for character : in both the 
adolescent learns effectively the knowledge how to command and how to 
obey. But the sympathy and camaraderie engendered have been confined 
to those of the boy's own rank and position in life. The republic in which he 



634 TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION L. 

is trained instils strong local patriotism, which, however, is intensive 
rather than extensive. His angularities are rubbed off, and his power of 
command is well trained. Hence he becomes, as a public man, if he attains 
to responsible positions in his island home, a sensible and just ruler 
within certain limits, but he perpetuates the prejudices of the class system. 
For the same reason, when his functions call him to the outlying parts of the 
Empire, he becomes an excellent governor over uncivilised races and over subject- 
peoples which, while not inferior to himself in civilisation, have been accustomed 
to domination through the centuries. But in countries like Australia, New 
Zealand, and Canada he is often, at first at least, a comparative failure, through 
the causes already enumerated, i.e., class-prejudice, want of wide sympathy, an 
insular distaste for customs and habits with which he is not familiar, and a lack 
of manual training in early life. In fact, the majority of English boys have, 
except in the narrow area of school-sports, very little knowledge of the scientific 
connection between mind and hand. Some improvement, however, in all these 
respects has been observable during the last ten years, but much more wide- 
spread educational reform is required to make our statesmen less insular and fit 
them for the government of their imperial estate. It is indeed these deficiencies 
that our brethren Overseas, and those of us who have divided our lives between 
our Island Home and our wide-flung Dominions, consider should be taken in 
hand and remedied in our schools and colleges if our vast and complex Empire is 
to survive as an organic whole.

of the State.

The following Paper was taken as read :— 

4. Educational P.ioneering (Queensland.) 
By J. D. Story. 

1. The difficulties which have to be overcome by the Queensland Education 
Department, in its efforts to give to each child the rudiments at least of a 
primary education, will be understood when it is realised that the State contains 
670,500 square miles; a total population of 656,224; a primary school population 
between the ages of five and fifteen of 138,551 ; individual holdings of 
2,900 square miles each; and some places a journey of at least two weeks from 
the Departmental base. The success of the Department in its efforts may be 
gauged from the fact that, according to the latest statistical returns of the 
Commonwealth, the percentage of Queensland children between the ages of five 
and fourteen who can read and write is no less than 92-69, while the percentage 
of children of the same age who cannot read is as low as 6-82. These figures 
it may be remarked are the best for any of the Australian States. 

2. As auxiliaries to the ordinary full-time schools, there is a system of travel- 
ling teachers, Saturday schools, week-end schools, part-time schools, house-to- 
house schools, and railway-construction camp schools. The last-named are par- 
ticularly necessary because of the rapid extension of railway facilities. The 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION L. 035 

State liiis already constructed 4,730 miles of railway at a total cost (including 
rolling-stock) of slightly over 34,000,000;., which for the last financial year 
returned 31. 8ti. 8d. per cent, interest; Pai-liament has approved of an addi- 
tional 1,406 miles on which -work has not yet been begun; and there are 301 
miles in course of construction at present. Many of the men employed in the 
construction have their families with them; and provision is made for the 
education of tilieir children by means of tent schools, which can be readily trans- 
ported from one camp to the next as the Avork progresses. 

3. The travelling-teacher system is designed to meet the educational needs of 
districts so sparsely populated, and with families so isolated, that at no one 
centre can a sufficient number of children be collected to warrant the establish- 
ment of a school. The sy.stem, which has proved a great success, was initiated 
in 1901, when one travelling teacher was appointed; there are at present 17, 
and from the beginning of 1915 the number will be increased to 20. This 
teacher must be a man of special qualifications, a knowledge of ' bushcraft ' 
being indispensable; but the Department supplies him with a buggy, horses, 
and camp equipment, as well as allowing him the services of a lad to tend the 
horses and otherwise assist. It is the duty of the travelling teacher to ascertain 
what scattered families with children requiring education are resident in the 
district assigned to him, and to visit every such family at least four times a 
year. He stays as long as possible at each visit, teaches the children, revises 
the work set at the preceding visit, prescribes the new work to be attempted, 
and advises and helps the member of the family — usually an elder sister — on 
whom devolves the duty of instructing the children during his absence. A 
much-appreciated feature in connection with the travelling teacher is that he 
carries with him a stock of school library books for lending to children and 
parents, and of Departmental School Papers for distribution among his pupils, 
thus providing a supi^ly of cheap and wholesome literature in the out-of-the-way 
places to which his duties take liLm. In the discharge of their duties during 
1913 the 17 travelling teachers covered a total distance of 60,438 miles, visited 
900 families, and instructed 1,884 children. 

4. Secondaj-y education in Queensland has always been well provided for, and 
secondary education is free to all who pass the qualifying examination ; there is 
also a liberal system of sustenance allowances for the children of parents of 
modest means. Scholarships to the University are also granted, and in addition 
to free tuition these scholarships carry sustenance allowances. 

5. Compulsory attendance carries with it the obligation to safeguard the 
health of the children who attend; and, accordingly, a scheme of medical and 
dental inspection — aiming at tlie practically useful rather than the scientifically 
exhaustive — has been evolved. The Department has two full-time and four part- 
time medical officers, one full-time ophthalmic inspector, and three full-time 
dental inspectors. In addition, the State at large liberally endows its hospitals, 
contributing two pounds for each pound locally subscribed, with the result that 
there are 90 well-equipped public hospitals; and at 28 of these the Department 
has arranged that, in return for a small annual payment, the hospital doctor 
shall attend to the children in his centre. 

6. Queensland upholds the Commonwealth scheme of defence and is giving 
the movement warm support; male teachers are being trained as cadet instruc- 
tors, and female teachers in charge of small schools are being given an appro- 
priate course of instruction, so that they may train their elder male pupils and 
generally improve the physique of the children in their charge, irrespective of 
sex. 

7. Queensland has many empty spaces t:0 be filled by a yeoman population ; 
the Education Department recognises that parents will not go to places where 
their children cannot be educated, and that the Department must do its part in 
encouraging settlement by making education available in every possible way, so 
that the vision may be realised of a Queensland fully occupied by a contented 
and happy people, a Queensland forming a strong outpost of the Empire, con- 
tributing to her prosperity in times of prosperity and ready to answer her call 
in the hour of her need.

Peesident of the Section. — A. D. Hall, M.A., F.E.S. 



The President delivered the following Address at Adelaide on Wednesday, 
August 12 : — 

The President of a Section of tlie Biitish Association has two very distinct 
precedents before him for his Address ; he can eitlier set about a general review 
of the whole subject to which his Section is devoted or he can give an account 
of one of his own investigations which he judges to be of wider interest and 
apfilication than usual. The special circumstances of this meeting in Australia 
have suggested to me another course. I have tried to find a topic which under 
one or other of its aspects may be equally interesting both to my colleagues 
from England and to my audience who are farming here in this great 
Continent. My subject will be the winning of new land for agriculture, the 
bringing into cultivation of land that has hitherto been left to run to waste 
because it was regarded as unprofitable to farm. To some extent, of course, 
this may be regarded as the normal process by which new countries are 
settled ; the Bush is cleared and the plough follows, or under other con- 
ditions the rough native herbage gives way to pasture under the organised 
grazing of sheep or cattle. I wish, however, to deal exclusively with what are 
commonly termed the bad lands, inasmuch as in many parts of the world, 
though recently settled, agriculture is being forced to attack these bad lands 
because the supply of natural farming land is running short. In a new 
country farming begins on the naturally fertile soils that only require a mini- 
mum of cultivation to yield profitable crops, and the new-comers wander 
further afield in order to find land which will in the light of their former 
experience be good. Before long the supply is exhausted, the second-class land 
is then taken up until the stage is reached of experimentation upon soils that 
require some special treatment or novel form of agriculture before they can be 
utilised at all. Perhaps North America affords the clearest illustration : its 
great agricultural development came with the ojoening up of the prairies of the 
Middle West, where the soil rich in the accumulated fertility of past cycles 
of vegetation was both easy to work and grateful for exploitation. But with 
the growth of population and the continued demand for land no soils of that 
class have been available for the last generation or so, and latterly we find 
the problem has been how to make use X)i the arid lands, either by irrigation 
or by dry-farming where the rainfall can still be made adequate for partial 
cropping, or, further, how to convert the soils that are absolutely poisoned 
by alkali salts into something capable of growing a crop. You yourselves 
will supply better than I can the Australian parallels, at any rate we in 
England read that the wheat-belt is now being extended into districts where 
the low rainfall had hitherto been thought to preclude any systematic cropping. 
Now, the fact that the supply of naturally fertile land is not unlimited 
reacts in its turn upon the old countries. During the 'eighties and 'nineties 
of the last century the opening up of such vast wheat areas in America, 
Argentina, Australia, and the develojiment of the overseas trade reduced 
prices in Europe to such an extent that in Great Britain, where the full extent 
of the competition was experienced, the extension of agriculture came to 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 037 

an end despite the continued increase of population. The area of land under 
cultivation has declined but little despite the growth of the towns, but the 
process of taking in the waste lands stopped and much of the land already 
farmed fell back from arable to cheaper pasture. But as soon as production 
in the newer countries failed to keep pace with the growth of population 
prices began to rise again, and we are now in the old world endeavouring to 
make productive the land that has hitherto been of little service except for 
sport and the roughest of grazing. Even the most densely populated European 
countries contain great areas of uncultivated land ; within fifty miles of 
London blocks of a thousand acres of waste may be found, and Holland and 
Belgium, perhaps the most intensively cultivated of all Western countries, possess 
immense districts that are little more than desert. Of the European countries, 
Germany has taken the lead in endeavouring to bring into use this undeveloped 
capital ; her population is rising rapidly and her fiscal policy has caused her to 
feel severely the I'ecent increase in the prices of foodstuffs, which she has deter- 
mined to relieve as far as possible by extending the productivity of her own 
land. It has been estimated that Germany possesses something approaching 
to ten million acres of uncultivated land and a Government department has 
been created to reclaim and colonise this area. 

Before dealing with the processes by which the rough places of the earth 
are to be made straight there is one general question that deserves considera- 
tion—Is it more feasible to increase the production of a given country by 
enlarging the area under cultivation or by improving the methods of the 
existing cultivators ? There is without doubt plenty of room for the latter 
process even in the most highly farmed countries : in England the average 
yield of wheat is about 32 bushels per acre — a good farmer expects 40 ; the 
average yield of mangolds, a crop more dependent upon cultivation, is as low 
as 20 tons per acre when twice as much will not be out of the way with good 
farming. A large proportion of the moderate land in England is kept in the 
state of poor grass — even as grass its production might be doubled by suitable 
manuring and careful management, while under the plough its production of 
cattle-food might easily be trebled or quadrupled. Why, then, trouble about 
adding to the area of indifferent land when so much of what has already been 
reclaimed, upon which the first capital outlay of clearing, fencing, roadmaking, 
&amp;c., has been accomplished, is not doing its duty? We are at once confronted 
by the human factor in the problem. The existing educational agencies which 
will have to bring about better farming will only slowly become effective, 
and however imperfect they still may be in England, they are mainly so because 
of the lack of response upon the part of the farmers. The present occupiers of 
the land do obtain in many cases a very inadequate return from it, but they 
make some sort of a living and they hold it up against others who, though 
they want land, cannot be guaranteed to use it any better. Improved 
farming means more enterprise, more knowledge, often more capital, and the 
man who can bring these to the business is far rarer than the man who, given 
a piece of land even of the poorest quality, will knock a living out of it by 
sheer hard work and doggedness. While, then, there should be no slackening 
in our efforts to improve the quality of the management of existing land, there 
is a case for also using every effort to increase the cultivable area; indeed, it 
is probable that for some time to come the second process will add most to 
both the agricultural production and the agricultural population. 

Let us now consider what are the factors which determine the fertility of 
the land that is first brought into cultivation and remains the backbone of 
farming in the old settled countries. Foremost comes rainfall, and the distri- 
bution is almost as important as the amount. Winter rain is more valuable 
than summer, and though cereal-growing is none the worse and may even 
obtain better results with a rainless summer, stock-raising and the production 
of fodder crops are the better for a rainfall that is distributed fairly evenly 
throughout the year. Eainfall, again, must bear some relation to temperature; 
some of the best farming in the Eastern Counties of England is done on an 
average rainfall of 20 inches; there are great areas in South Africa with the 
same average rainfall that are little better than desert. In temperate regions 
we may say that the naturally fertile laud requires a rainfall of from 20 to 



638 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION M, 

50 inches per annum, not too much segregated into seasons and some at least 
falling in the winter. 

If the rainfall is excessive or the drainage inadequate to carry it off, the 
formation of peat is induced, resulting in such uncultivated areas as the 
bogs of Ireland and the moors of Eastern England, Holland, and Germany. 

Given suitable rainfall and temperature the texture of the soil becomes a 
factor of importance ; if too coarse and sandy, so little of the rainfall is retained 
that we get all the effects of drought secondarily produced. In itself the 
open texture of a coarse sandy soil is favourable to plant development ; under 
irrigation, or where the situation is .such as to result in permanent water a 
short distance below the surface, fine crops will be produced on sandy soils that 
would remain almost barren if they only depended upon the rainfall for their 
water. In Western Europe large areas of heaths and waste land owe their 
character to the coarse and open texture of the soil. At the opposite extreme 
we find clays so heavy that their cultivation is unprofitable; such soils, how- 
ever, will carry grass and are rarely left unoccupied. For example, in the 
South-East of England there are a few commons, i.e., land which has never 
been regarded as worth enclosing and bringing into particular ownership, 
situated on heavy clay land ; most of such land is pasture, often of the poorest, 
or, if at any elevation, has been covered with forest from time immemorial. 

One last factor in the soil is of the utmost importance to fertility and that 
is the presence of lime — oi calcium carbonate, to be more accurate — in quantities 
suificient to maintain the soil in a neutral condition. Old as is the knowledge 
that lime is of value to the soil, we are only now beginning to realise, as 
investigation into the minute organisms of the soil proceeds, how fundamental 
is the presence of lime to fertility. A survey of the farming of England or 
Western Europe will show that all the naturally rich soils are either definitely 
calcareous or contain sufficient calcium carbonate to maintain them in a neutral 
condition even after many centuries of cultivation. Examples are not lacking 
where the supply of calcium carbonate by human agency has been the factor 
in bringing and keeping land in cultivation. I have discussed one such case 
on the Rothamsted estate and several others have come under my notice. 
The amelioration of non-calcareous soils by treatment with chalk or marl from 
some adjacent source has been a traditional usage in England and the North 
of France : Pliny reports it as prevailing in Gaul and Britain in his day, and 
the farmer of to-day often owes the value of his land to his unknown prede- 
cessors who continuously chalked or marled the land. Upon the presence of 
carbonate of lime depends the type of biological reaction that will go on in 
the soil, the beneficial bacterial processes that prepare the food for plants 
only take place in a medium with a neutral reaction. The Rothamsted soils 
have provided two leading cases. I have shown that the accumulation of 
fertility in grass-land left to itself and neither grazed nor mown, so that 
virgin conditions were being re-established, was due to the action of the 
organism called Azotobacter, which fixes free nitrogen from the atmosphere, 
and was indirectly determined by the presence of calcium carbonate in the 
soil, without which the Azotobacter cannot function. Examination of typical 
examples of black soils from all parts of the world, the prairies of North 
America, the steppes of Russia and the Argentine, New Zealand and Indian 
soils, showed in all of them the Azotobacter organism and a working pro- 
portion of carbonate of lime. Now, as we know, all virgin soils are not rich, 
and only in a few parts of the world are to be found those wonderful black 
soils that are often several feet in depth and contain 10 to 20 per cent, of 
organic matter and 3 to 5 parts per thousand of nitrogen. These soils are all 
calcareous, they occur in regions of a moderate rainfall inducing grass-steppe 
or bush conditions, and the annual fall of vegetation provides the organic 
matter which the Azotobacter requires as a source of energy in order to fix 
nitrogen. Non-calcareous soils under similar climatic conditions do not ac- 
cumulate nitrogen and become rich; in the absence of carbonate of lime 
the nitrogen-fixing organisms are not active, and the soil only receives from the 
annual fall of vegetation the nitrogen that was originally taken from it. There 
is but a cyclic movement of nitrogen from the soil to the plant and back 
again, whereas in the calcareous soils there is also continuous addition of fresh 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 639 

nitrogen derived from the atmosphere, in which process the carbonaceous part 
of the annual crojj supplies the motive power. 

The other leading case to be found at Rothamsted is that of certain grass- ' 
plots which have artificially been brought into an acid condition by the 
continued application of sulf)hate of ammonia. In these soils nitrification is 
suspended, the nitrification organisms have even disappeared, though the 
herbage still obtains nitrogen because most plants are able to utilise ammoniacal 
nitrogen as well as nitrates. The interesting feature, however, is that the 
decaying grass on these acid soils jiasses into the form of peat, a layer of 
which is forming upon the surface of the soil, though nothing of the kind is 
found on adjacent idiots where the use of lime or of alkaline manures has 
prevented the development of acidity. From this we may learn that the 
develoi^ment of a surface layer of peat, independent of waterlogging (when 
another kind of peat forms even under alkaline conditions), is determined by 
the acidity of the soil, when certain of the bacterial processes of decay are 
replaced by changes due to micro-fungi which do not carry the breaking-down 
of organic matter to the destructive stage. This affords us a clue 
to the origin of many areas of upland peat in the British Isles, where the 
remains of ancient forest roots and stumps of trees are found on the 
true soil surface below the layer of peat, but where there is no water- 
logging to bring about the death of the trees and the formation of peat. We 
may suppose that when the land-surface became fit for vegetation at the 
close of the glacial epoch it covered itself with a normal vegetation, chiefly 
dwarf foriist, because of the rainfall and temperature. The soil, however, 
being without carbonate of lime, would in time become acid with the pro- 
ducts of decay of the vegetable matter falling to the ground, and as soon 
as this acid condition was set up peat would begin to form from the grassy 
surface vegetation. The process would continue until the acid conditions 
and the depth of the accumulating layer of peat would kill the trees, the 
stumps of which would remain sealed up below the peat. I am far from 
thinking that this explanation is complete, but at least we have facts in 
sight which could lead one to suppose that a non-calcareous soil originally 
neutral and carrying a normal vegetation can naturally become acid, alter 
the character of its vegetation and clothe itself with a layer of peat. The 
point of economic importance is that these peaty acid soils are of very little 
value as long as they are acid, though they take on a quite different aspect if 
they are limed and made neutral. 

Of all the soil factors making for fertility I should put lime the first ; upon 
its in-eseuce depend both the processes which produce available plant food in 
quantities adequate for crop-production at a high level and those which naturally 
regenerate and maintain the resources of the soil ; it is, moreover, the factor 
which is most easily under the control of the agriculturist. 

I need say little about those cases in which infertility is due to the 
presence in the soil of some substance which is actually injurious to plant- 
growth, because such substances are nearly always due to the physical environ- 
ment of the soil, to too much or too little water. In waterlogged situations 
we may find in the soil peaty acids, iron salts, sulphides, &amp;c., inhibiting the 
growth of plants; in arid regions the soil may still be charged with an excess 
of soluble compounds of the alkalis and alkaline earths, resulting from the 
decomposition of the rocks that have been broken down to form the soil, but 
which through the inadequate rainfall have never been washed out. The 
establishment of normal conditions of growth, irrigation in the one case, 
drainage in the other, will speedily result in the removal of the deleterious 
substances. Practically, only bodies that are soluble can get into a plant to 
injure it, hence such bodies can be removed from the soil by water, provided 
that the water can find its way through the soil and escape. 

Let us now consider the various methods by which land suffering from 
one or other of the disabilities we have just discussed is nowadays being brought 
into cultivation. The most important, if we consider the area affected, is the 
extension of cropping into regions of deficient rainfall by means of what has 
been termed dry-farming. As far as its immediate methods go, dry-farming 
consists in nothing more than the application of the principles of husbandry 



640 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION M. 

worked out by English farmers in the East and South-East of England, jjrin- 
ciples first expounded by Jethro Tull, though a complete explanation was not 
then possible, even if it is now. In the first place, the tilth must be made both 
deep and fine, thus whatever rain falls will be absorbed and the conditions 
favouring a deep and full root range will have been established. Next, the 
soil below the surface, though finely worked^ must be compact, because only 
thus can the water present travel to the roots of the plant. Lastly, a loose 
layer must be maintained on the surface, which, though dry itself, acts as a 
screen and a barrier to prevent loss of water from the effective soil below by 
any other channel than that of the plant. Granted these methods of cultiva- 
tion, the new feature about ' dry-farming,' which has been introduced by 
settlers in the arid districts of Australia and North America, is the use oi 
a year of bare fallow in which to accumulate a supply of water for the next 
year's or two years' crop. This raises the fundamental question of how much 
water is necessary for the growth of an ordinary crop. The first investigation 
that Lawes and Gilbert carried out at Rothamsted dealt with this very point; 
they grew the usual field crops in pots, protected the surface of the soil from 
evaporation so that all the loss of water proceeded through the plant, weighed 
the water that was supplied from time to time, and finally weighed the pro- 
duce, expressing their results as a ratio between the dry matter produced 
and the water transpired by the plant. These experiments have been repeated 
under different climatic conditions by Hellriegel in Heidelberg, by Wollny in 
Vienna, by King and others in America. Now the two processes in the 
plant, carbon assimilation and transpiration, are not causally connected, though 
as both are carried out in the leaf and have some factors in common they are 
found to show some constancy in their relative magnitudes. Lawes and 
Gilbert obtained a ratio of about 300 lbs. of water transj)ired for each pound 
of dry matter harvested, but the other investigators under more arid conditions 
found much higher figures, up to 500 and even 700 to 1. Now, a crop yielding 
20 bushels of wheat per acre will contain about a ton of dry matter per acre, 
so that, taking the high ratio of 500 to 1, no more than 500 tons of water per 
acre or 5 inches of rain will have been consumed in the production of this 
crop. It is, of course, impossible to ensure that all the rain falling within a 
year shall be saved for the crop ; much must evaporate before it reaches the 
subsoil where it can be stored, and only when the crop is in full possession of 
the land can we expect that all the water leaving the soil shall go through 
the crop. What proportion the waste bears to that which is utilised will depend 
not only on the degree of cultivation but ui^on the season at which the fall 
occurs ; summer showers, for example, that do not penetrate more than a few 
inches below the surface will be dissipated without any useful effect. When 
the climatic conditions result in precipitation during the winter, the water will 
be in the main available for crop-production; and it has been found by experi- 
ence that cereals can be profitably grown with as small a rainfall as 12 inches. 
The necessary cultural operations consist in producing such a rough surface as 
will ensure the water getting into the subsoil, hence autumn ploughing is 
desirable. Where the precipitation is largely in the form of snow, a broken 
surface also helps both to absorb the thawing snow and to prevent it being 
swept into the gullies and hollow places by the wind. On some of the Russian 
steppes it has become customary to leave a long stubble in order to entangle 
as much snow as possible, but probably a rough ploughing before the snowfall 
would be even more effective. When the rainfall drops to the region of 12 to 
16 inches and occurs during the summer months, then dry-farming methods 
and the summer fallow become of the first importance. The deep cultivation 
ensures that the water gets quickly down to the subsoil away from danger 
of evaporation, and the immediate renewal of a loose surface tilth is essential 
in order to conserve what has thus been gained. 

In connection with this dry-farming there are several matters that 
still require investigation before we can decide what is the minimum rainfall 
on which cultivation can be profitable. In the first place, we are only imper- 
fectly informed as to the relation between rainfall and evaporation. At 
Rothamsted there are three drain-gauges side by side, the soil layers being 
20, 40, and GO inches deep respectively. The surface is kept rough and free 



PBESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 641 

from growth, though hardly in the condition of looseness that could be 
described as a soil mulch. Yet the evaporation, even under a moist English 
atmosiihere, amounts to one-half of the annual rainfall, and the significant 
thing is that the evaporation is approximately the same from all of the 
gauges and is independent of the depth of subsoil within which water is 
stored. Evaporation, then, would seem to be determined by surface alone, but 
we are without systematic experiments to show how variations in the surface 
induced by cultivation will alter the rate of evaporation. A knowledge 
of the evajjoration factor would then inform us of what proportion of the 
rainfall reaches the subsoil ; we then want to know to what extent it can 
be recovered and how far it may sink beyond the reach oi the crop. It is 
commonly supposed that the subsoil below the actual range of the roots of 
the crop may still return water by capillarity to the higher levels that are 
being depleted, the deeper subsoil thus acting as a kind of regulating reservoir 
absorbing rain in times of excess and returning it when the need arises. But 
some work of Leather's in India and Always on the great plains of North 
America throw doubt on this view, and would suggest that only the layer 
traversed by roots, say, down to a depth of 6 feet, can supply water to the 
crop ; the water movements from the deeper layers due to capillarity being too 
slow to be of much effect in the maintenance of the plant. The evidence on 
either side is far from being conclusive and more experiment is very desirable. 

It would also be valuable to know how far evaporation from the bare 
.soil can be checked by suitable screens or hedges that will break the swee]) 
of the wind across the land. In England hedges have always been looked 
at from the point of view of shelter for stock; we find them most developed 
in the grazing districts of the west, while bare open fields prevail in the east 
and south. Yet the enormous value of a wind-screen to vegetation can be 
readily observed, and the market-gardeners both in England and the still 
dryer districts of the south of France make great use of them. Lastly, we 
must have more knowledge about the relation between transpiration-water and 
growth : we do not know if the high ratios we have spoken of hold for all 
plants. Xerophytic plants are supposed to be possessed of protective devices 
to reduce loss of water. Are they merely effective in preserving the plant from 
destruction during the fierce insolation and drying it receives? and do they 
enable a plant to make more growth on a given amount of water? Wheat, for 
example, puts on its glaucous waxy bloom under dry conditions. Is this really 
accompanied by a lower rate of transpiration per unit surface of leaf ? and is it 
more than defensive, connoting a better utilisation of the water the plant 
evaporates ? 

The cultivation of these soils with a minimum rainfall necessitates varieties 
of plants making a large ratio of dry matter to water transpired and also with 
a high ratio between the useful and non-useful parts of the plant. Mr. 
Beayen has shown that the difference in the yields of various barleys under 
similar conditions in England are due to differences in their migration factors : 
the same amount of dry matter is produced by all, but some "will convert 50 
per cent, and others only 45 per cent, into grain. This migration ratio, as 
may be seen by the relation between corn and straw on the plots at Rothamsted, 
is greatly affected by season; nevertheless Mr. Beaven's work indicates that 
under parallel conditions it is a congenital characteristic of the variety and 
therefore one that can be raised by the efforts of the plant-breeder. The needs 
of dry-land-farming call for special attention on the part of the breeder to these 
two ratios of transpiration and migration. 

Closely linked up with the problems of dry-land-farming are those which 
arise in arid climates from the use of irrigation-water on land which 
is either impregnated with alkaline salts to begin with or develops such a con- 
dition after irrigation has been practised for some time. The history of 
irrigation-farming is full of disappointments due to the rise of salts from the 
subsoil and the subsequent sterility of the land, but the conditions are fully 
understood and there is no longer any excuse for the disasters which have 
overtaken the pioneers of irrigation in almost every country. Sterility may 
arise from two causes — overmuch water which brings the water-table so close 
to the surface that the plants' roots may be asphyxiated, or the accumulation

642 TBANS ACTIONS OF SECTION M. 

by evaporation of the soluble salts in the surface layer until plants refuse to 
grow. The annual cutting off of the cotton crop in Egypt as the water-table 
rises with the advance of the Nile flood affords a good example oi asphyxiation, 
but in the neighbourhood of irrigation canals we also find many examples of 
sterility due both to the high water-table and an accompanying rise of salts. 
The governing principle is that drainage must accompany irrigation. Even 
if free from salts at the outset the land must accumulate them by the mere 
evaporation of natural waters, and they will rise to the surface where they 
exert their worst effect upon vegetation, unless from time to time there is 
actual washing through the soil and removal of the water charged with salt. 
Without drainage the greater the quantity of water used the greater the 
eventual damage to the soil, for thereby the subsoil water-table cari-ying the 
salts is lifted nearer to the surface. With a properly designed irrigation system 
the danger of salting ought not to occur ; there are, however, many tracts of 
land where the supply of water is too limited to justify an expensive scheme 
of iri-igation channels with corresponding drainage ditches at a lower level. 
Take the case of a single farmer with some water from an artesian well at 
his disposal, with perhaps little rainfall, with land subject to alkali, and no 
considerable natural fall for drainage. If he merely grades the land and waters 
it, sterility rapidly sets in ; the only possibility appears to be to take a com- 
paratively limited area and to cut out drainage ditches or tile drains 4 or 
5 feet below the surface, even if they have to be led into a merely local 
hollow that can be abandoned to salt. The bed thus established must then 
be watered at any cost until there is a flow in the drains, after which the 
surface is immediately cultivated and the crop sown. There should be no 
further application of water until the crop covers the land^ the use of water 
must be kept to a minimum, and by the ordinary methods of dry cultivation 
evaporation must be allowed only through the crop, not merely to save water 
but to prevent any rise of salt. With a loose surface and wind-breaks to 
minimise evaporation it has thus proved possible to grow valuable crops even 
on dangerously alkaline land. Superphosphate and sulphate of ammonia have 
proved to be useful fertilisers under these conditions; both tend to prevent 
the reaction of the soil becoming alkaline, and the calcium salts of the super- 
phosphate minimise the injurious effects of the sodium salts that naturally 
accumulate in the land. On the other hand, nitrate of soda is a dangerous 
fertiliser. Attempts have been made to reduce the salts in the land by the 
growth of certain crops which take up a large proportion of mineral matter, 
but I have not been able to ascertain that much good can be thus effected. 
Sugar-beet and mangolds do appreciably reduce the salt content, but are hardly 
valuable enough to pay jtor such special cultivation and the limited irrigation- 
water; the best thing appears to be to grow salt- bush on the non-irrigated 
margin of such areas, if only to prevent the efflorescent salts from blowing on 
to the cultivated portion. 

Let us now turn to the problem of land reclamation as it occurs in North- 
western Europe. There are two main types of land that have hitherto been left 
waste, the peaty and the sandy areas. Of the peaty areas we can distinguish 
again between the low-lying moors bordering the lower courses of the great 
rivers ; for example, in England near the mouth of the Trent, and the upland peat- 
bogs of which Ii'eland furnishes so many examples. They have these features 
in common — an excess of water, a deficiency of mineral salts, and, particularly 
in the upland bogs, a strongly acid reaction; but they possess great potential 
wealth in their richness in nitrogenous organic matter. It is in Germany and 
Holland that the methods of bringing into cultivation these moors have been 
most completely worked out ; in Germany, for example, it is estimated that 
there are about five million acres of moorland, of which about 10 per cent, is 
now under cultivation. The reclamation process must begin by drainage, which 
may be carried out by open ditches, but is most satisfactorily effected by pipes, 
despite the greater cost. The water-table must be kept some 3 feet below the 
surface. In districts which afford a market for peat, as, for example, on the 
Teufelsmoor near Bremen, the reclamation often begins by cutting out the 
peat, the lower layer of firm peat being won, dried, and sold for fuel. The 
upper spongy peat can be used for litter, but some part at least must be thrown 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 643 

back. Where the burning peat is thus extracted the excavation is in places 
pushed further until the underlying sand is reached, and enough of this is 
dug to spread over the reclaimed area to a depth of 4 or 5 inches and 
mixed by cultivation with the spongy peat. Even when the peat is not 
removed, pits are often made in order to sand the land, so great an improve- 
ment does it effect in the character of the crops. However, sanding is not 
possible everywhere, and there are great areas under cultivation where the 
reclamation begins with drainage, followed by the cultivation of the immediate 
surface without either sanding or the removal of the burning peat, which indeed 
are impossible over large areas, but are carried out by the owners of small 
farms little by little. Special tools are required : certain forms of disc-ploughs 
and harrows give the best results ; heavy tools for large-scale cultivation by 
steam or electricity are furnished with broad roller -like wheels ; even the horses 
must wear broad wooden shoes. 

The next stage is the manuring, and it has only been the development of 
the artificial-fertiliser industry during the last half-century that has rendered 
the cultivation of this type of land possible. On the alluvial moors where the 
ground water has always been alkaline, the peat is rich in calcium and no treat- 
ment with lime and marl is necessary (the English fens afford an example of 
this type of soil), but on the true peat-bogs (Hochmoor of Germany) the manur- 
ing must begin with a good dressing of burnt lime, or, better, of marl or ground 
chalk. For meadows and pastures two tons per acre of lime, or twice as much 
of carbonate of lime, should be applied ; the amounts may be halved for arable 
land. This must be followed by about 5 to 8 cwt. per acre of basic slag and an 
equal amount of kainit, which applications should be renewed in the second 
year, but then diminished in accord with the cropping. However, some phos- 
phoric acid and potash salts must be continuously supplied, with occasional 
dressings of lime or chalk on the acid peaty areas. These latter also require 
in their earlier years nitrogenous manures, for the peat is slow to yield up the 
nitrogen it contains. The fertilisers should bo nitrate of soda or lime, never 
sulphate of ammonia. The whole success of the reclamation depends on the 
use of these manures, as the peat in a state of nature is almost devoid of both 
phosphoric acid and potash ; on the acid peats, again, normal growth is only 
possible after a neutral reaction has been attained by the use of lime or marl 
With this manuring it is found to be easy to establish a good meadow herbage 
in a very short space of time; it is not even necessary to get rid of the 
surface vegetation of Erica and other heath and bog plants. The manure 
is put on and the surface is worked continuously with disc-harrows and rollers, 
but never deeply ; a seed-mixture containing chiefly red, white, and Alsike 
clovers, Lotus uUginosus, rye-grass, Timothy, and cocksfoot, is sown in the 
spring and soon succeeds in choking the native vegetation. 

It is impossible to say what is the cost of the reclamation of moorland in 
this fashion ; the big expense is the drainage and the construction of roads, 
both of which are entirely determined by local conditions. But of the value of 
the process when accomplished there can be no doubt. I have seen a case quoted 
from the ' Ostfriesische Zeitung,' where a piece of moor bought for 75?. was 
reclaimed and sold for 900?. ; and, best test of all, one may see in places like the 
Teufelsmoor near Bremen, families living in comfort on thirty to forty acres 
of what was once merely wild moor with no productive value. 

Of even greater interest in England is the reclamation of heath-land, which 
has of late years been proceeding apace in Germany. In this category we may 
include all land which owes its infertility to the coarse grade and low water- 
retaining power of the particles of which the soil is composed, the soil being 
at the same time as a rule devoid of carbonate of lime, and covered in conse- 
quence with heather and similar calcifuge plants. In England there exist 
extensive tracts of uncultivated land of this character in close proximity to the 
considerable populations, but the process of reclaiming such land for agriculture 
seems to have come to an abrupt conclusion somewhere about 1850, when the 
developing industries of the country began to offer so much greater returns for 
capital than agriculture. That land of the kind can be cultivated with success 
is evident from the mere fact tliat everywhere prosperous farms may be seen 
bordering the wastes, possessing soils that are essentially identical with those of 

T T 2 



644 TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION M. 

the wastes. These were brought under cultivation when labour was cheaper, 
often without calculation of the cost because the work was done piecemeal at 
times when the men would otherwise have been idle. Were any strict account 
to be framed, the reclamation probably did not pay its way for many years, and 
it has only become possible again because of modern advances in science and 
machinery. As examples of the type of land, I may instance the Bagshot 
Sands on which, in north Surrey, in Berkshire and Hampshire, and again in its 
southern development in the New Forest, lie so many thousands of acres of 
uncultivated heath. No systematic reclamation has taken place, but every- 
where farms have been carved out on this formation, often by the industry of 
squatters, and within reach of London the vast supplies of town manure which 
used to be available have converted some of it into fertile land. The crystalli- 
sation of common rights into charters for public playgrounds, its growing 
appreciation for residential purposes, will now always stand in the way of the 
utilisation of most of the Bagshot Sands for agriculture, but further afield there 
are many areas of similar character. The Lower Greensand is perhaps equally 
discounted by its residential value, but on the Tertiaries of Dorset, the Crag 
and Glacial Sands of Suffolk and Norfolk— the brak, the Bunter Beds of the 
Midlands, lie many expanses of waste that are convertible into farming land, 
just as Lincoln Heath and much of the beautifully farmed land of Cheshire have 
been gained for agriculture within the past century. Equally possible is an 
attack upon the sandy areas, warrens or links, behind the sand-dunes on many 
parts of the English and especially the Welsh coasts ; not all of them are 
wanted for golf, and many can be fitted for market-gardening. Of old the only 
way of dealing with such land was merely to clear it, burn the rubbish, and 
start upon the ordinary routine of cultivation, but for a long time on such a 
system the crops will hardly pay their way from year to year, and the permanent 
deficiencies of the soil in lime and mineral salts remain unrepaired. In Cheshire 
the enormous value of marl and bones in such a connection was early recognised ; 
it has been the later discovery of the potash salts that renders reclamation a 
commercial proposition to-day. The method that is now followed is to begin by 
clearing the land of shrubs, burning off the roughest of the vegetation, and 
turning over a shallow layer in the summer, leaving the heathery sod to the 
killing and disintegrating action of sun and frost until the following spring. 
The manure is then put on — lime or ground chalk or marl as before, basic slag 
and kainit, and the sod is worked down to a rough seed-bed on which lupins 
are sown, to be ploughed in when they reach their flowering stage. The growth 
of the lupins makes the land, they supply humus to bind the sand together and 
retain moisture, they draw nitrogen from the atmosphere and with the 
phosphoric acid and potash form a complete manure for succeeding crops. 
Sometimes a second crop of lupins is ploughed in, but usually the land is put 
immediately to an ordinary rotation of rye, oats, potatoes, and clover. When 
the heath-land is divided among small tenants in an unreclaimed state, cropping 
often begins without the lupins, the necessary nitrogen being imported by nitrate 
of soda, but for years the land shows inferior results. Only the tenant can 
rarely afford to lose the year the lupin crop involves, and so great is the demand 
for land in Germany that the State finds it preferable to let the tenant reclaim 
than to reclaim for him, and charge him as rent the cost of the more thorough 
process. And now as to the finance of the operation ; the reclaiming down to the 
ploughing in of the lupin crop costs from 51. to 61. an acre, the bare heath costs 
from 51. to 71. an acre, the reclaimed land after a few years' cultivation would 
sell at 20Z. to 30Z. an acre. Meantime the State has probably made a free grant 
for drainage, looking to get some interest back in increased taxation ; the local 
authority has also made roads for which the increased rating due to a new 
agricultural community must be the only return. It is a long-sighted policy 
which will only find its full justification after many years, when the loans have 
all been paid off and the State has gained a well-established addition to its 
agricultural land and its productive population. In comparing English with 
German conditions there are certain differences to be taken into account — in the 
first place the work of reclamation will be dearer in England because of the 
higher price of labour, then the land will not be so valuable when won because 
the higher scale of prices for agricultural products enhances the price of land 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 645 

in Germany. Next, I doubt, in view of the great industrial demand for men 
in England, if we have the men available who will bring to the land the skill 
and power of drudgery that I saw being put into these German holdings of thirty 
to forty acres in their earlier years of low productivity. Moreover, in 
Germany these heaths are generally bordered by forests, in which the small 
holder gets occupation for part of the year while his wife and children keep 
the farm going. For this, if for no other reason, afforestation and land 
reclamation and settlement should go on together. But, despite these draw- 
backs, I am still of opinion that the reclamation of such heath-lands is a sound 
commercial venture in England, either for a landowner who is thinking of a 
future rather than of a present return on his capital, or for the State or other 
public body, wherever the waste land can be acquired for less than 5Z. an acre. 
The capitalised value of its present rental rarely approaches that figure, but the 
barrenest heath is apt to develop the potentialities of a gold-mine when purchase 
by the State comes in question. The map of En,gland is so written over in detail 
with boundaries and rights and prescriptions that the path of the would-be 
reclaimer, who must work on a large scale if he is to work cheaply, can only 
be slow and devious. There are other possibilities of winning agricultural land 
even in England, from the slob land and estuaries, from the clays nowadays too 
heavy for cultivation; but the problems they present are rather those of 
engineering than of agricultural science. What I should like in conclusion once 
more to emphasise is, that the reclamation of heath and peat-land of which 1 
have been speaking— reclamation that in the past could only be iinperfectly 
effected at a great and possibly unremunerative expense of human labour-— has 
now become feasible through the applications of science, the knowledge of the 
functions of fertilisers, the industrial developments which have given us basic 
slag and potash salts, the knowledge of the fertility that can be gained by the 
o-rowth of leguminous plants. From beginning to end the process of reclamation 
oi moor and heath, as we see it in progress in North-Western Europe, is stamped 
as the product of science and investigation.

Discussion on Dry Farming. 

(1.) Dry Farming Investigations in the Unilccl States. 
By Dr. Lyman J. Briggs.— See Eeports, p. 263. 

(ii.) The Ten-inch Line of Rainfall. 
By Professor Thomas Cherry, M.D., M.S. 

The relative importance of Australia in regard to the future food-supply of 
the world is influenced to a very marked degree by its average winter tempera- 
ture and the peculiar incidence of the rainfall throughout the southern third of 
the Continent. In these regions the term ' dry farming ' has a different mean- 
ing from that accepted in the Northern Hemisphere, on account of the fact that 
our rainfall is almost exclusively of the winter type, and that the winter tem- 
peratures are high enough to keep the ordinary cereals growing steadily during 
these months. Consequently, /before the dry summer sets in the crops have 
reached a sufficient degree of maturity to complete their ripening before the soil 
has become too dry to arrest all further growth. 

Graphs were shown illustrating typical rainfall records in the region of the 
winter rains in all the States of the Commonwealth except Queensland and the 
Northern Territory. A brief comparison was made with the limited areas in 
other parts of the world which are similarly situated. 

As a result of these conditions it may be said that in the southern parts of 



646 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION M. 

the whole of Australia ' dry farming ' does not begin until the 15-inch line of 
rainfall is passed, because the winter and the total rainfalls are nearly identical. 
The experience of the last fifteen years has shown : — 

(1) That with the assistance of small amounts of soluble phosphates profitable 
crops may be grown on less than 10 inches of winter rainfall. 

(2) Provided the land is fairly fertile rapid growth takes place in July and 
August, so that a considerable margin is available in autumn for early and late 
planting. 

(3) The dry weather towards harvest-time materially reduces the risk from 
all fungus diseases in cereals. 

(4) Wherever wheat can be grown peas may also be grown if necessary as 
an alternate crop. 

(5) Evaporation in winter is comparatively small, and consequently by fallow- 
ing and other modern methods a payable crop is obtained on a lower rainfall 
than is the case in any other part of the world. 

(6) The slight ground-frosts which often occur in the winter nights appear to 
stimulate the growth of the cereals when followed by ten hours of bright sun- 
shine. 

(7) The chief problem which has now to be solved is to devise methods by 
which large numbers of sheep and cattle can be profitably kept on the wheat 
farms in the 10-inch rainfall regions. 

(8) Lands originally covered with scrub and producing very little grass have 
been proved to be very suitable for wheat. With the gradual advances in the 
numbers of stock kept on these farms permanent agricultural settlement is 
likely to extend well beyond the 10-inch line of rainfall. 

(iii.) The Soil-Moisture Problem in Western Australia. 
By Professor John W. Patebson, B.Sc, Ph.D. 

The author said that a sufficient supf)ly of soil-moisture was, practically 
speaking, the paramount factor in crop-production. This was true in the rela- 
tively moist climate of Great Britain ; the fact was illustrated in an extreme 
degree in Australian agriculture. Seasonal variations were less marked in 
Western Australia than in the Eastern States, and a graph was exhibited show- 
ing the variations in wheat yields per acre of the various States since 1901. 
The effects of drought were not simply connected with the annual rainfall of 
a locality. This was a popular fallacy ; but when a crop suffered from drought 
the result was contributed to by quite a number of factors. Among those he 
would mention — (1) the total annual rainfall, (2) its monthly distribution, 
(3) the rate of evaporation as from a free surface of water, (4) the effect of 
climate upon the transpiration ratio of the crop, (5) the amount of soluble salts 
in the soil, (6) the physical character of the soil, (7) the skill in cultivation 
of the farmer, (8) the selection of drought-resistant species and varieties of 
crop-plant. In regard to annual rainfall, the South- Western corner of the 
State averaged well over 30 inches, but on the Eastern fringe of the wheat- 
belt wheat could be successfully grown with a 10-inch rainfall, but the greater 
part of the wheat area had an average of 14 to 20 inches. To visitors these 
amounts would seem low. The monthly distribution, however, was highly 
advantageous, as from 70 to 80 per cent, fell between an autumn seed-time 
and harvest. The third factor, viz., rate of evaporation, tended, however, 
against success, and data were quoted from the Commonwealth Weather Bureau 
showing that the annual loss by evaporation in the wheat-belt ranges from 60 to 80 
inches of water, as against about 20 inches in the South of England. In England 
therefore the annual evaporation would amount to about two-thirds of the 
annual rainfall, while in the chief farming districts of Western Australia it 
was from four to six times greater than the rainfall. Closely connected with 
this in some, but not all, of its contributing causes was the lower eflBciency 
of water to the growing crop, as indicated by the amount required to produce 
a given weight of dry plant substance. The transpiration ratio was indeed 
less a function of the kind of crop (speaking of the common crops) than a 
function of the climate, and the author quoted from experiments he had carried 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION M. 647 

out showing that on land of moderate fertility a ratio of 600 to TOO would be 
required for the wheat areas. This was roughly double the English ratio. 
Again, as regards soluble salts, the drier areas commonly held a slightly higher 
percentage than British soils, and while in Western Australia ' alkali ' rarely of 
itself caused infertility, his experience of alkali lands, which he had inve.stigated 
for the Victorian Government, indicated that such salts increased the liability 
of crops wilting. On consideration they would expect this. Again, the physical 
character of the soil had an important effect, and the sandy character of much 
of the western lands gave it an advantage over the heavier soils in a d"ry season. 
This was contradictory to his experience in the English Midlands with a 32-inch 
rainfall. Fifteen inches of rain absorbed by the surface five feet of soil would 
add something less than 20 per cent, of water calculated on the dry soil if it 
were absorbed without loss. But the annual rainfall was spread over several 
months, and the fact seemed to be that with a 15-inch rainfall the sandy soil 
could hold all the rain which fell, and the greater absorbent power of the 
clay soil was then of no advantage. It was indeed a disadvantage, as the finer- 
grained soil could not yield up so much of its absorbed water before wilting set 
in, and in the drier seasons and districts the ' sand plain ' gave superior results 
to the forest land. In regard to cultivation methods, the author quoted figures 
from his experiments showing the large saving of soil-moisture by early cultiva- 
tion and maintaining a soil mulch. The water saved would usually equal from 
5 to 7 inches of rain in the surface five feet of soil. In Western Australia good 
results from fallowing were more easily obtained than in Victoria, where the 
more frequent summer rains tended to cake the surface, rendering fresh working 
of the land necessai-;^'. The water saved showed itself in the crop yields, and 
the results of a Kellerberrin farmer last season, showing 17 bushels on sand plain 
fallowed, and 5 bushels on similar land ploughed from stubble, could be regarded 
as typical under a 12-inch rainfall. The British farmer did not sufficiently 
realise the use of the soil mulch in protecting his winter-ploughed lands from 
the drying winds of spring. Lastly, as to the selection of drought-resistant 
plants, much had been done through acclimatisation, selection, and cross-breed- 
ing, but a careful analysis of the various factors which in wheat constituted 
drought-resistance remained to be carried out before they could claim that plant- 
breeding for this object was placed on a scientific basis. Under the dry con- 
ditions of Australian wheat-growing a safe yield rather than a lieavy yield was 
the primary consideration. This necessitated the selection of early or middle- 
early varieties, thin seeding, and in the great majority of cases the non-iise of 
nitrogenous manures. 

(iv.) The Capillary Power of Soils. By Heber Green, D.Sc. 

The conventional mechanical analysis supplies data about the sizes of the particles 
of the soil ; the information actually required concerns the behaviour of the soil 
with respect to the movements of air and water therein. These latter are dependent 
on the sizes and distribution of the free spaces between the particles and only 
indirectly on the sizes of the particles. 

This suggests a direct measurement, if possible, of the factors determining these 
physical characters and conditions of the soil, and the magnitudes to be considered 
are : — 

S, the pore space, expressed as a fraction of the total volume of the soil ; and 
6, the water-content, similarly expressed. 6/S is then the fractional saturation 
of the soil. 

Po and Poi, the permeabilities to air and water. Incidentally the ratio of these 
two gives us an indication of the amount of colloidal matter present in the soil and 
of its tendency to swell when wet. 

K, the capillary power. This taken with the previous factors gives a measure 
of the rate at which water will percolate from a wet to a dry region in the soil. 

These factors (S, 6, P, and K) have been previously defined and_methods for 
their measurement described.' 

Of these S, 6, and P are simple properties with obvious physical meanings, but 
K (the capillary power) is of a more complex character and may be defined as the

pull per unit area which the soil can exert on a layer of water in contact with it. This 
capillary power will obviously depend on the water-content of the soil ; when 9/S—l, 
then K=0 ; the maximum value of K being reached when fl/iS=0, i.e., when the 
soil is dry. 

The value of K between any given limits of fl/S becomes of practical importance, 
for under field-conditions soils are rarely absolutely dry or completely saturated

and the water-movements with which we are most concerned are from relatively 
moist to relatively dry sections. 

This capillary power is due to the surface-tension effects produced by the attrac- 
tion between the walls of these capillary pores and the water in the soil, and may 
be most conveniently studied by considering a vertical column of soil with its lower 
end placed just in contact with a free surface of water. It has previously^ been

shown that such *a eohimn of soil will behave (statistically speaking^ as a bundle of 
napillary tubes, varying from a maximum radius depending on the size of the largest 
soil-grains down to others extremely minute. The water will rise in each capillary 
to a height inversely proportional to its radius, equilibrium being rapidly attained 
ill the larger tubes ; but, as the frictional resistance varies inversely as the fourth 
power of the radius, the rate of rise in the smallest tubes will steadily slacken but 
will not absolutely cease within any finite time. 

This rise without limit is in conflict with the generally accepted opinion, and 
Hilgard"* quotes a series of experiments by Loughridge, in which the final heights 
recorded (after several months) are regarded as maxima for the soils concerned. 
The rate of rise in his experiments may bo shown to be inversely proportional to the 
time ; i.e., dh/dt=k/t or h=A+li log. t. From the examples illustrated in the graph 
in the accompanying diagram it is clear that any apparent limit to h within a reasonable 
time or variation from a linear function can only be due to initial disturbances or 
other accidental errors. 

With a view to a further and more accurate investigation the author has arranged 
a laboratory draught-cupboard so that it can be maintained at a constant temperature 
for several months at a time. 

Experiments have been carried out on the rate of rise of water in soils of different 
types ; and the dependence of K (the capillary power) on S and 9/S and on the sizes 
of the soil grains has been investigated. 

(v.) Flax as a Paying Crop. By C. P. Ogilvie. 

Flax destined for fibre has to be cultivated on different lines from that of 
flax-seed or linseed (as it is usually called). Should seed be required, flax is 
sown thinly, about a bushel and a half per acre— by planting thinly the stem has 
a chance to branch out and flower. 

If fibre is the chief object the seed is planted closer — about two or two 
and a half bushels per imperial acre — the result being the drawing up of the 
stalks with little tendency to branch. 

The total of the last available figures shows that the world's flax crop (includ- 
ing Russia for 1911) was grown on over four and a half million acres, which 
produced over 800,000 tons. 

In 1912 Russia alone had .3,832,056 acres under cultivation, which produced 
817,871 tons, and out of this she exported 345,216 tons, realising 11,432,954?. To 
the United Kingdom she sent 68,500 tons, valued at 3,474,187?. 

In Ireland there are nearly 1,000,000 spindles at work, over 7,000,000?. are 
sunk in mills, machinery, etc., and 5,300,000?. are constantly locked up in 
manufactured goods ; 3, .300,000?. are annually paid to Irish fibre-workers. 

It would seem, therefore, that the agricultural part of the business is assured, 
but it is not so. 

In England and Scotland flax has almost ceased to be grown, and the acreage 
in Ireland has been reduced from 301,693 in 1864 to 46,921 in 1912. The acreage 
cultivated in 1913 was, however, increased. 

Within the last two or three years great strides have been made in our know- 
ledge, and Governments are assisting colleges and others in studying the history 
and habits of flax. 

By constant attention and selection longer straw which will not branch until 
full height will be secured. A steady growth produces best fibre, and small 
clean stems will produce the finest filaments. The root itself has no fibrous 
tissues. 

The fibres are surrounded by pectose, and lie in bundles containing varying 
numbers of filaments. 

Tlie process of separating fibre from the boon and rind has engaged many 
minds. Artificial means and chemistry have been employed without end. 
Recently a new method has been tried upon the principle of solvency under 
pressure, and has proved highly successful. 

The old process of retting and scutching was explained.

Interest in the flax-fibre industrj' has entered into a new phase of existence, 
with a brighter liorizon. 

Given suitable land, good seed, careful supervision, scientific degumming, and 
improved scutching, there is no reason why farmers should not devote part of 
their land to flax for production of fibre. It should return a better result 
financially and give greater employment than any other crop usually grown.

1. Methods of Milk Recording. By Alexander Laudee, D.Sc. 

In this paper a short account was given of the methods of obtaining the milk 
records of dairy cattle as carried out in Scotland and Ireland. In Scotland the 
work has been practically confined to the Ayrshire breed. A scheme has been in 
operation since 1903, but in the earlier years the number of herds under inspection 
was comparatively small. The work is now under the direction of the Scottish 
Milk Records Committee, a representative body in receipt of an annual grant 
from the Development Fund. In 1914 this grant amounted to 2,000?. The 
number of cows under inspection has increased rapidly from year to year, and 
during the present year has reached 25,000. 

The work is carried on through local societies consisting of twelve to twenty- 
four members, so that the work of each society is sufficient to take up the whole 
time of a recorder. The weighing and testing may be done every fourteen, 
twenty-one, or twenty-eight days, according to circumstances, an interval of 
twenty-one days being the most common in Scotland. The recorder arrives at 
the farm in the afternoon, weighs, and determines the percentage of fat in the 
evening milk and the morning milk next day. All the testing and weighing is 
done by the recorder, the farmer being only asked to supply details as to feed- 
ing, times of calving, &amp;c. A copy of the record is left with the farmer, and a 
copy forwarded to the offices of the Central Committee. 

Finance. — The expense of carrying on a local society may be put at about 
80/. per annum. Part of this expenditure is met by a grant from the Central 
Committee, and the remainder is apportioned between the members. In some 
societies the members are charged so much per cow. The cost per cow is from 
l-'. 9rf. to Is. lOd. per annum, and each member is charged on a minimum of 
forty cows. 

Fesulfs. — The systematic keeping of records of the yield of milk and the per- 
centage of fat has led to the gradual elimination of the less productive cows from 
the herds. In this way the average yield of the herds has been greatly increased, 
and also their value, especially for export purposes. In some herds the average 
annual yield per cow has been increased by 100 to 200 gallons in six to eight 
years. 

The increase in the value, since the beginning of the scheme, of Pedigree 
(Milk Record) Ayrshires for export purposes is estimated at about 50 per cent. 

In this connection the importance of the sire being descended from a dam of 
good milking qualities has been proved by experiment, and cannot be too strongly 
emphasised. 

Classification of Cows. — For purposes of comparison the j-ield of milk is 
calculated to the equivalent amount containing one per cent. fat. 

In judging cows at cattle shows the more rational method of taking into 
account the milk-yielding capacity of the cow is gradually superseding the 
former method of depending solely on appearance. Three classes are now com- 
monly adopted : — i.. For cows giving over 1,200 gallons; ii., for those over 1,000 
gallons; iii., for tliose over 800 gallons. 

Irish Method. — The milk recording and testing in Ireland are carried out 
under a scheme of the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction. 
Under this scheme the cows have first to be inspected and approved. The farmer 
weighs the milk on one definite day per week, and his herd and records are open 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION M. 651 

to inspection at any time without notice. The Department's inspector checks 
the farmer's weighings, and takes samples of the milk at intervals for analysis. 
Approved cows, of proved milk-yielding capacity, are then eligible for entry in 
the Department's herd book. 

A short account was given of Gavin's statistical inquiry into the accuracy of 
estimating a cow's milking capability by her first lactation yield [Gavin, ' The 
Interpretation of Milk Records ' (Journal Boyal Agricultural Society, 1912, 
p. 153); 'Studies in Milk Records' [Journal Agricultural Science, 1913, vol. v., 
parts 3 and 4)]. 



2. Milking Machines in Victoria. By E. T. Aecher. 

There are about fourteen different makes of milking machine in this State, 
and as far as can be ascertained 2,000 farmers have been supplied with 
machines equal to 6,000 single machines or pulsators. Some of these have been 
put out of use for various reasons considered below. One of the principal advan- 
tages in connection with machine milking is that it makes a farmer practically 
independent of labour, which is a difficult problem in this country. 

When the machines are handled properly by those who take an interest in 
them they give thoroughly satisfactory results; especially is this the case with 
heifers first broken in to the machine. It is found also that the milk keeps satis- 
factorily. That this should be the result with proper handling is proved by 
the experience at the Lady Talbot Institute. On the other hand, it is difficult, 
almost impossible, to persuade the average dairy-farmer to exercise the neces- 
sary care in cleansing the machines, and when this is neglected the quality of 
the product suffers. 

Types of Machines. 

All the machines but one in nse in Victoria are worked on the vacuum 
principle, which is produced either by pump or by a steam-ejector. The 
system.s in use are the bucket and the conduit or tank. In the conduit system 
the milk is conveyed from the teats through pfpes to a tank in any convenient 
place, but the pipes become an additional menace in careless hands. They are 
of brass or gun-metal with polished surface inside. Experiments are being 
made with strong clear glass tubes to replace the metal. If these prove satis- 
factory it will be easy to see if they are clean. In this system various valve 
devices are used to provide automatic release of the milk so that the vacuum 
may be sustained. 

Another type of apparatus used for milking, which on account of its apparent 
cheapness and simplicity is likely to find favour with the uninitiated, consists of 
four ordinary milk-tubes or teat-syphons with rubber tubes attached to convey 
the milk to the buckets. 

Many reliable users of the milking machine claim that with the machines the 
cows never have sore teats, and if used on a cow with sore teats they rapidly 
heal and do not bleed as they do when milked by hand. Some claim that con- 
tagious mammitis is more likely to spread with machines, but this only applies 
to the careless man. 

Cost of Upkeep. 

This varies according to care bestowed, but under proper treatment it may 
be put down at about \l. per machine per annum. Aluminium is largely used 
now in the teat-cups, and many of these appear to corrode rapidly at the top 
and bottom. Some attribute this to milk, but it is more probably due to the 
soda used in cleansing. It is questionable if aluminium is suitable for this 
purpose. Light gun-metal or brass cups nickel-plated appear to stand better. 

The Sanitary Aspect. 

The greatest problem in connection with the milking machine as it presents 
itself in this country is with regard to sanitation. The difficulty is to impress 
users with the necessity of properly cleansing the machines as soon as possible 
after using. The experience gained through the Lady Talbot Institute goes to 
prove that with proper care milk can be produced giving an exceptionally low 
loacterial count.

3. Trials of Milking Machines. By Dr. E. Stenhouse Williams, 
J. GoLDiNG, and James Mackintosh. 

At the trials of milking machines arranged by the Royal Agricultural (society 
of England in 1913, the chemical and bacteriological tests were conducted by 
the authors. Eleven machines competed, and the paper discussed the various 
lines of development along which future progress may take place. 

At the outset it may be stated that the Committee excluded syphon machines 
on the ground ' that they were rightly considered by the Society to be injurious 
to the cows.' 

There remained then two types of machine : — 

A. Pressure machines, those in which an attempt was made to simulate the 
process of hand milking, and 

B. Suction machines, those in which suction in one form or another was 
employed. 

Of the former three competed. The bacteriological results were as follows : —

P. Squeezing of teats by rubber plates associated with adjustable shields

particles. Open bucket underneath the udder. 

Q. The milk was expressed by pressure only and conveyed by short channels 
to an open tray, thence by a tube to the receiver which is suspended underneath 
the cow. As it enters the receiver the milk is strained. 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION M. 653 

Remarlts on Suction Machines. 

The results obtained with these machines depend, firstly, on the defects in 
the machines themselves, and, secondly, on the care and skill of the operator. It 
was not always possible to differentiate between these, but the following instance 
may be given as indicating the effect of want of care in this direction. 

A (average bacteriological count 3,103 per c.c.) compared with D (average 
bacteriological count 1,579 per c.c). 

A was a better machine but not so well cleansed. 

Again, if we consider four of the suction machines in all of which reasonable 
care was taken in the cleansing, we find that the average count varied from about 
2,000 to about 4,000 organisms per c.c. On the other hand, the two machines in 
which the cleansing was undoubtedly indifferent had average counts of 41,419 
and 12,384. The bacterial content in the machine giving 12,384 was mainly due 
to inefficient cleansing of the machine. In the machine giving 41,419, insufficient 
cleansing, excessive length of rubber tubing, and leakages contributed to the 
high count. 

It appears, therefore, that suction machines, as exhibited in this trial, 
depended to an unreasonable extent on the personal equation, and demanded an 
amount of intelligence that cannot be expected from the average cow-man. 

The results seem to indicate that some type of pressure machine milking 
directly into a covered can might give the most effective bacteriological results 
in the hands of an ordinary worker. 

The suction machines with their tubing and fittings require a cleansing 
between each milking, which almost amounts to bacteriological sterilisation, if 
really good results are to be obtained. The absence of the means to effect this 
on many farms, and the lack of training in those who have to perform the work, 
render a plea for the simplification of the machine specially cogent.

5. Milh and Butter Records of Pure-hred Cows in Australia, with 
Special Reference to the Australia^i Breed of Milking Shorthorns. 
By M. A. O'Oallaghax. 

This paper showed what the Government of New South Wales and the 
breeders of pure-bred dairy cattle are doing towards obtaining the records of all 
pure-bred cows in the State. 

Records were given for Australian dairy shorthorns, and also a brief history 
of the formation of this breed. 

Records were also given for Jerseys and Guernseys. 

Climate and Food Conditions in relation to Composition of Milk. 

The question of the effect of extreme periods of drought during which time 
cows receive no green foo J was referred to as affecting the solids not fat in milk. 

The question was also raised as to the effect on the percentage of fat in milk of 
almost continual sunshine and absence of rainy weather coupled with good food 
conditions, such as prevail on the irrigated lands of Yanco district, New South 
Wales.

6. Preliminary Note on Wool Inheritance. By P. G. Bailey, M.A. 

This paper dealt with the methods employed in the experiments made at 
Cambridge on the question of the ' Inheritance of Wool Characters,' and the 
results so far obtained from these experiments. 

A cross was made between two Merino rams sent us by the late Mr. Charles 
Harper, of Western Australia, and twenty Shrop.shire ewes. Thirty-one F^ rams 
and forty-one F, ewes were obtained from this cross. An F, ram was mated to 
the F, ewes, and from these we have now got thirty-three F, rams and forty- 
seven Fj ewes, but of these Fj sheep only six rams and eight ewes have been 
shorn. 

The methods employed in this investigation were the following : — 

(1) Each sheep was given an earmark number in order that a complete pedi- 
gree should be kept. 

(2) At shearing, small samples were taken from the two shoulders, neck, belly, 
and britch. The fleeces were then given the number of the sheep from which 
they came, were weighed and sent to Professor Barker at the Technical College, 
Bradford. They were there sorted into the commercial qualities. 

(3) The commercial qualities apparently depend upon a large number of 
factors, each of which is possibly independent in its inheritance. These factors 
have been stated to be lustre, uniformity in length, waviness, and, most imjDor- 
tant of all, average diameter of fibre. Consequently it became necessary to 
analyse these factors separately. With Mr. F. L. Engledow's help, a micro- 
scopical investigation has therefore been made into these characters, especially 
as regards average diameter of fibre. 

Results so far obtained : — 

(1) Range of qualities shown by Bradford sorting : — 

Merino rams Quality 64s 



Shropshire ewes 
Fi rams 
F, ewes 
Fj rams 
F2 ewes 



54S-50S 
6OS-44S 
60S-50S 
60S-54S 
603-54S 



There is, in fact, a high range of variation in the Fj generation, but the great 
bulk of the F^ sheep are of a quality intermediate between those of its Merino 
and Shropshire parents. 

(2) No accurate investigation has yet been made into the amount of grease in 
fleeces, but it was seen that the Fj generation were intermediate in this respect 
between the two parents. 

(3) The microscopical investigation of the average diameter of the fibres 
points to the fact that the great bulk of the Fj sheep are intermediate as regards 
this character. 



TRAJSSACTIONS OF SECTION M. 655 

It has incidentally been shown that in order to obtain a probable error of less 
than 3 per cent, of the average of any sample it is necessary to take 160 measure- 
ments of that sample. 

(4) There is ;i laige variation in the range of the weights of the Fj fleeces. 

(5) The F, generation are also intermediate as regards the number of waves 
per inch.

WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 19. 
Joint Discussion with Section G on Irrigation. 

(i.) Irrigation Works in Italy. ^ By Professor Luigi Luiggi, D.Sc, 
M.Inst.C.E., President, Italian Society of Civil Engineers. 

The average tourist who visits Italy and admires the splendid orange- 
groves round Sicily and Calabria, the industrial flower-gardens of the Ligurian 
Riviera, the luxurious vegetable-gardens and orchards of Tuscany and Campania, 
or the extensive green meadows of exuberant trefoil and lucerne of Lombardy 
and Lower Piedmont — if he has any tinge of poetry in his veins — ^will be apt to 
raise a hymn of praise to Providence for bestowing upon Italy such great 
blessings, and forget the industry of its inhabitants accused of the sins of ' dolce 
far niente.' 

And truly Italy has been greatly favoured by a mild climate with plenty 
of sunshine — although even in excess in some parts ; but beyond this, Providence 
has not done much more than for any other nation of Southern Europe, if it 
were not that it has also given to Italy a very hardy race of people, full of 
resources, very thrifty, content with little, and ready to till the land cheerfully 
from dawn to dusk in the hope of getting good crops, notwithstanding the 
numerous drawbacks of a rather poor soil, of a very irregular rainfall — ^in excess 
during the winter months, when it causes inundations, and nearly absent for 
five to seven months of the warm season, during which a fierce sun would scorch 
the land and dry up all vegetation if the industry of the Italian farmer did not 
overcome these natural drawbacks by means of a rational system of irrigation. 

And, in fact, the prosperity of agriculture in the regions just mentioned — 
which are the most prosperous in Italy — is due exclusively to the incessant 
work of men who, far from enjoying much ' dolce far niente,' have applied, 
and are extending continually, the art of irrigation, which in Italy dates back 
from the time of the Etruscans, and has reached great perfection in our days. 

Without irrigation, the rich orange-groves, the bountiful orchards and 
vegetable-gardens, which give such valuable products for exportation to Central 
Europe and North America, could not exist, and the land would give but a 
scanty revenue to its owners ; but especially the luxurious and extensive meadows 
of the valley of the Po — which are intensely green all the year round, and give 
even seven or eight crops of fodder per year — could not exist, and barely one or 
two cuttings of grass could be raised without the help of irrigation. 

It is the art of the hydraulic engineer and the intelligence and perseverance 
of the agriculturist that, by regulating the natural water-courses, impounding 
the water in reservoirs, or raising it from the subsoil or from the natural 
streams, and then distributing this water intelligently over the land at the 
proper time — that is, by scientific irrigation — have transformed the waste sandy 
plains of Piedmont and Lombardy into the most prosperous meadows of Europe, 
and made the orange-groves around the Tyrrhenian coasts so plentiful and beauti- 
ful as to cause Goethe to give to Italy the name of ' the land where the orange

As the climatic conditions of Australia are very similar to those of Italy, 
it may be interesting — and it is hoped useful — to the citizens of the Common- 
wealth to know how Italians manage to get the best out of the natural con- 
ditions of their native land, which, owing to the prosperous state of agriculture 
from time immemorial — which leaves a good surplus for improvements and 
comfort — has made Italy the land of music, of poetry, and of arts. 

After this introduction, showing that irrigation is the principal factor 
of the advanced state of agriculture, and the princijDal source of revenue for the 
Italian nation, the author described the different ways of getting water for 
irrigation, and how it is distributed over the cultivated fields. 

The Cost of Water. — When only small quantities are required, as for the 
orange-groves and flower-gardens, the water is generally raised from the sub- 
soil — at the foot of the hills or round the coasts — either by very primitive means 
such as water-buckets [cicognc)' moved by men, or norias, or rosary-pumps 
moved by animals, as in Southern Italy, or by small but very modern centrifugal 
pumps moved by oil or electric motors, used especially along the Ligurian 
Riviera and in many parts of the valley of the Po, where hydro-electric plants 
are very common. 

The cost of the water raised electrically — especially during the daytime, when 
the electric current is distributed at lower rates than at night — varies from O'lO 
to 025 franc per cubic metre (from 4:^d. to llf/. per 1,000 gallons), and it i.s 
considered not dear, for if raised by animals or, worse still, by men, its cost 
would be respectively eight to seventeen times higher. 

Nevertheless the products grown with irrigation realise such high prices that 
this expenditure is justified, and also a very fair profit is left to the growers of 
oranges, early vegetables, and flowers, which find a ready market in Central and 
Northern Europe, especially during the winter months. The revenue of a good 
orange-grove varies from 2,000 to 3,000 francs per hectare (36/. to 54/. per 
acre) per year. 

Huge li'cservoirs. — For irrigation on a large scale — that is, for fairly large 
farms of some 50 to 100 acres in extent, where ordinary vegetables, fruit trees, 
vines, olives, &amp;c., are cultivated — this price of water would be prohibitive, and, 
besides, the quantity would be insufficient. Then recourse is had to collecting 
the rainfall-— which on the average varies from 36 inches in North Italy to 
15 inches in the South — by storing it up in reservoirs. These vary from the 
modest cisteri\ of some few hundred cubic metres capacity, sufficient for the 
horticulturist, to large artificial lakes of many million cubic metres formed in 
some valley of the Alps or of the Apennines by high dams, built either of earth, 
rock-fill, or masonry, the last being generally preferred. 

There are already many large reservoirs, especially in Northern Italy, such 
as the Lagastrello, Brasimone, Gorzente, Devero, Adamello, and others, but the 
largest of all is now in construction in Sardinia, across the River Tirso. The 
dam, of masonry, is 55 metres high (179 feet), and is of gravity section. It 
will impound 350 million cubic metres (12,250 million cubic feet) of water 
^so that it will be the largest in Europe — suflicient to irrigate from 20,000 to 
30,000 hectares (about 50,000 to 80,000 acres) of land capable of being cultivated 
for early vegetables, fruit, oranges, olives, vines, and such good-priced products. 

Several other dams are soon to be built in Southern Italy, the most important 
being on the rivers Bradano, Sila, Simeto, and Fortore. The latter will be 
75 metres high (243 feet), and will impound 410 million cubic metres (14,350 
million cubic feet) of water and irrigate about 100,000 acres in the fertile plains 
of Apulia. 

The water from all these artificial lakes is generally used first for motive 
power, in some hydro-electric installations — ^which in Northern Italy are very 
plentiful, and this helps much in lowering the price of the irrigating water — 
and afterwards it is distributed by means of canals to the different farms, at 
prices varying from about 0-005 to 0-01 franc per cubic metre (from ^d. to ^d. 
per 1,000 gallons), or at the 'lump sum' or 'annual rate' of from 80 to 120 
francs per hectare (1/. 10s. to 21. 10s. per acre per annum). 

These prices, however — although quite reasonable in semi-arid regions, where 
a timely irrigation may save the crops from total failure in a year of drought — 
are still too high for ordinary irrigations, especially of meadows, and besides. 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION M. 657 

for very large extensions of land, the quantity of water that can be impounded 
in an artificial lake is always comparatively small. 

CatKih. — iSo, when large quantities are required, the water is obtained from 
rivers, fed, generally, by some natural lake, like the rivers Ticino, Adda, 
Oglio, Mincio, or by some glacier which, melting in the summer season, acta 
practically like a lake of frozen water ; in this condition are the rivers Tanaro, 
fo, Dora, Oreo, Adige, and many others. 

The engineering works consist of a submergible dam of very substantial 
masonry, built across the river, and capable of raising the level of the water to 
that of the country to be irrigated ; of some controlling sluices at the canal head ; 
and of a main canal, with lateral distributing ditches, provided at their intake 
with some apparatus for measuring the water to be delivered. Generally, the 
' Cipeletti Weir ' or some such over-tall weir is used. No mechanical meters 
are adopted, except for very small deliveries. 

The pi'ice of this canal water varies from 20 to 45 francs per hectare per year 
(8s. to 11. per acre). 

Many of these irrigation canals date back from the Middle Ages. For 
instance, the ' Naviglio Grande ' was built in the twelfth century, and is used 
also for inland navigation — in fact, it is a feature of these canals called 
' Navigli ' to serve both for irrigation and navigation purposes. The 
' Naviglio Grande ' is about 50 miles long, and has a capacity of 55 cubic metres 
(2,275 cubic feet) per second ; and in order of date come the ' Muzza ' with 
eO cubic metres, the ' Cremona ' with 30 cubic metres, and scores of smaller ones. 

Of the canals of modern times — that is, built during the last fifty years — the 
most interesting, also from the point of view of the engineering features, are 
the ' Cavour ' canal with 110 cubic metres discharge (3,850 cubic feet) per 
second, -the ' Villoresi ' with 44 cubic metres (1,500 cubic feet), the ' Marzano ' 
with 30 cubic metres (1,050 cubic feet), the ' Veronese ' with 15 cubic metres 
(510 cubic feet), and the ' Tagliamento ' with 17-5 cubic metres (600 cubic feet) 
per second. They are really models, both from the engineering point of view and 
the perfection of their administration; so much so, that many engineers come 
from all parts of the world to study them. 

The largest and longest of all is the ' Cavour ' canal, with a discharge 
capacity of 110 cubic metres (3,850 cubic feet) per second, and a development of 
fully 1,000 miles, including its branches. It was built in 1855-65 by a private 
company that failed, and was taken over by the State. 

This canal, the most important in Europe, was the means of transforming an 
almost barren region of 250,000 acres of sand and gravel — useful only for growing 
timber and bushes — into the most fertile rice-fields and meadow-land of Italy, 
where the best Parmesan and Gorgonzola cheeses are produced. A still larger 
canal is about to be undertaken, the ' Emiliano ' canal, with a capacity of 300 
cubic metres (10,500 cubic feet) per second, 120 miles long, and estimated to cost 
12,000,000^. 

Results of Irri(jation. — The author described, with the help of lantern slides, 
the most salient engineering features of some of these canals, i.e., their head- 
works— one of them at the ' Ombrone ' inlet is capable of receiving 600 cubic 
metres (21,000 cubic feet) per second — and the numerous aqueducts and syphons 
over and under existing canals or rivers ; pointing out that the irrigation canals 
of Italy carry the life-blood of the national agriculture. He described also how 
the water is applied to the crops, the ' rotations ' or periods of irrigation used 
according to the nature of the land, its permeability, and the crops to be raised ; 
concluding with the results obtained by irrigation, which are most satisfactory 
from the agricultural point of view, as the rent of the fields is more than 
doubled or trebled by irrigation. From the financial point of view of the 
Canal Administration, however, with very rare exceptions, the results are not 
so satisfactory, and in fact are generally disappointing. It is not suflicient ta 
build a canal carrying a large vokrnie of water, it is necessary to sell this water — 
that is, find the farmers ready to use it — and provide to pay for the original cost 
of the canal and its ordinary expenses. But in order to use the water, it is 
necessary for the farmers first to prepare their own distributing ditches, then 
to level their fields properly, and learn how to apply the water to the land at 
the moment, and in the proportion most convenient ; to decide which crops are 

19M. u u 



658 TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION M. 

the most profitable in regard to the different markets, and — where the land is 
not very permeable — it is also necessary to prepare drainage ditches in order to 
get rid of the surplus water that otherwise might damage the vegetation or pro- 
duce an excess of parasitic plants. All this requires experience, time, and 
capital, and thus the Administration of the irrigating canal is not in a con- 
dition to sell all its water for many years. 

In the best conditions it takes from twenty to thirty years — and sometimes 
even more — to dispose of all the water of a large canal. 

For instance, the ' Marzano ' canal, which crosses the province of Cremona, 
where irrigation has been adopted since the Middle Ages, and all the distribut- 
ing ditches were already made when the main canal was built — in fact, its 
function is that of increasing the flow of the older irrigation canals — needed 
fully thirty years before all its cubic metres per second of water were dis- 
posed of, although the conditions were most favourable. The ' Villoresi,' also 
in a region where irrigation is pretty well developed, after forty years has not 
yet disposed of all its water, and the financial conditions of its administration 
are far from being prosperous. 

The State's Help. — ^This is the reason why the State considers it is its duty to 
help all these undertakings. Irrigation puts under cultivation large tracts of 
land of very little value, and in places almost sterile, and part of the population 
that now emigrates abroad can thus find useful employment in the cultivation of 
this land, otherwise nearly useless, and thus increase the national wealth. 

Italy has an increase of population of almost one million souls per year, and 
some 500,000 to 600,000 people are obliged to emigrate, especially to North 
America, or Central Europe, while some 100,000 go to Argentina, and 50,000 to 
other countries round the Mediterranean. 

To moderate this exodus, which is not beneficial to the country, the State 
encourages irrigation by granting a subsidy of three per cent, per year for 
a period of ten years on the capital spent in the construction of the main 
canal and its principal branches, two per cent, per year for the following ten 
years, and one per cent, for another period of ten years. Then the subsidy 
ceases, but in the meantime these subsidies, capitalised at five per cent., repre- 
sent already about thirty-five per cent, of the initial expenditure. But if the canal 
is arranged in such a way as to help to control the tiood-water of rivers — as when 
impounding reservoirs are also built — then some subsidy is also granted on the 
capital in the proportion of ten per cent, to thirty per cent, of the expenditure. 
For instance, for the Tirso reservoir and canal, estimated at about 20 million 
francs (800,000L), the State, besides the usual grants, pays three million francs 
(120,000^.) for the beneficial effect on the regime of the river, and grants a 
yearly subsidy of 150,000 francs (6,0001.) for fifty years for the canal, provided 
that the price of the water for irrigation is not more than 32 francs per hectare 
per year (lis. per acre). After sixty years all the works become the property of 
the State. 

The conclusion, based on Italian experience, is that irrigation is very bene- 
ficial to the individual farmer, when he can get the water by paying 30 to 
50 francs per hectai'e per year (lis. to 17s. per acre), but not to the Adminis- 
tration of the canal during at least the first thirty years; so the undertaking 
requires a great help from the State during this trying period. But in the 
meantime the State, in the form of taxation, and in the increased welfare of its 
citizens, reaps a large benefit from these works, which is more than sufficient 
to repay amply all the sacrifices made for this purpose. Without irrigation 
Italy would not be able to feed a large portion of its present population; as it 
is, with its wonderful network of irrigating canals, it has become the ' garden 
of Europe,' and is now preparing to extend irrigation in order to be able in 
thirty years' time to feed a population of fifty to sixty million inhabitants. 
This gives an idea of the satisfactory results accomplished by scientific irriga- 
tion, and explains also the reason why the Italian State encourages and helps 
financially all such undertakings.

(ii.) Some Factors controlling the Growth of Cotton^ 
By H. T. Ferbar, M.A., F.G.S. 

Among the main factors which control the cultivation of cotton on a com- 
mercial basis are : — (1) Temperature, (2) water-supply, (3) soil, (4) labour. 

(1) The cotton-plant is commonly found in those parts of the world which lie 
within thirty degrees of the Equator, but finds its best development in what may 
be described as sub-tropical climatological regions. In Egypt the air-tempera- 
tures which rule at sowing-time are in the neighbourhood of 65° F. ; as the plants 
attain maturity the temperatures gradually rise to values of 82° F. and 83° F. 
and fall some 9° or 10° during harvest. 

(2) The water requirements of the crop are equivalent to about 46 inches of 
rainfall, which in Egypt is met by irrigation from perennial canals. The water- 
factor naturally depends upon environment. The methods adopted by the 
Egyptian cultivators were described. 

(3) The volume (depth) of .soil available to the roots of the cotton-plant is of 
more importance than its texture or its chemical composition, provided always 
that the soil contains sutficient available plant-foods. In Egypt cotton is grown 
profitably on a soil which in one extreme case is an almost pure sand, and in 
the other extreme an unctuous clay. Diagrams were exhibited showing how a 
high water-table, by reducing the volume of available soil, limits the yield of the 
plant. 

(4) The profits derived from the cultivation of cotton naturally depend upon 
the cost of agriculture. Where the price of labour is high better returns are 
obtained by cultivating the more valuable types of cotton. The higher-grade 
Egyptian cottons grow best in the Delta, while warmer Middle Egypt supplies a 
cotton {Ashmuni) whose fibre is of medium value only. 

The East Coast of Australia would seem to provide the requisite temperatures 
and rainfall necessary for cotton-cultivation, but widespread experiment is 
necessary if it is desired to prove what areas provide suitable soil conditions and 
what is the margin of profit of the husbandman. 

(iii.) Two Maps illustrating the Fertilitxj of Lower Egypt.^ 
By H. T. Ferr.\r, M.A., F.O.S. 

In an arid country water-supply is the most important factor governing the 
fertility of the soil, and, given a sufficiency of water, the origin or the chemical 
composition of the soil is usually of secondary importance. Evaporation being 
active under arid conditions there is a tendency for salt to accumulate in the soil 
to the detriment of agriculture. In the United States of America much arable 
land has deteriorated owing to the accumulation of salts caused by injudicious 
irrigation, and the next step in Egypt's agricultural progress is the provision 
of a widespread and efficient network of drains. 

The programme of this work is now in hand, and, in order to be in a position 
to assess the improvement effected after the improved drainage facilities begin 
to operate, the Egyptian Survey Department was asked to make a survey which 
would record the present condition of the land. A Fertility Map of part of the 
Northern Delta was shown. The map on a scale of 1 : 50,0U0 is reduced from the 
1 : 10,000 field-sheets of Mr. F. E. Frith and myself, which are coloured accord- 
ing to an eye-estimate of the value of the land. The agricultural value has been 
proved to depend upon the salt-content of the soil, and in order to control the 
arbitrary scale adopted frequent soil-samples have been analysed by Mr. F. 
Hughes of the Agricultural Department. The mean salt-content of what we 
have called good land (coloured yellow on the map) is about 0-3 per cent., 
medium land (burnt sienna) about 0-5 per cent., poor land (sepia) 0-8 per cent., 
and barren or uncultivated land (purple) 1 per cent, to 20 per cent. 

On comparing this map with another on the same scale showing the contours 
it is noticeable hovv the fertility depends upon both absolute and relptivf) levels 
i.e., upon natural drainage. The good land occurs in the south, aiid tiecomes

gradually inferior, and finally barren as sea-level is approached, except for 
narrow strips along the high-lying arterial waterways. 

Canals such as these, though sometimes following a tortuous course, are 
always the most satisfactory, firstly because they easily command the country 
they serve with irrigation water, and, secondly, because the evils of salt- 
accumulation consequent on active infiltration are reduced to the lowest possible 
minimum. Conversely, drainage channels are not fully efficient unless they 
follow closely the lowest parts of depressions between opposing elevations. 
In Egypt differences of level are usually comparatively small ; nevertheless, re- 
modelling of water-channels, which in the old days were not excavated according 
to the contours, has formed part of the irrigation programme since the British 
occupation of that country. 

It is understood that some Australian irrigation projects have not been 
entirely successful owing to difficulties such as are indicated, and it is urged 
that it is an economy to spend money on detailed mapping of new country before 
launching on projects of canalisation, which if lacking in finality may entail a 
greater outlay on remodelling than would have been needed for the initial survey.

We first survey the plot, then draw the model.'

The following Papers were read : — 

1. Migration of Reserve Material to ike Seed in Barley conmlcred r/.s n 
Factor of Productivity. By E. S. Beaven. 

With barley the ratio of the dry matter accumulated in the seed to the total 
dry matter of the plant when fully ripe frequently influences the produce of 
grain to a greater extent than any other factor; also it is more important in 
barley than in either wheat or oats, because the value of the dry matter of the 
haulm {i.e., the stem and leaves) is less with barley; also this ratio is higher 
in some races of barley than in any variety of the other cereals, and probably 
higher than in any other cultivated plant." The paper dealt with some of the 
bearings of these facts. 

This ratio varies considerably as between different varieties of barley and 
as between different races of the same variety of any cereal species. It has a 
high value for purposes of selection, especially in the early stages of selection 
from amongst a limited number of individual plants which are the progeny 
obtained by the artificial cross-fertilisation of any two individuals. 

As between two races, each the progeny of a single plant of the F4 generation 
of the same cross, and with the same weight of dry matter in the entire plants 
on unit area, the inherited and persistent difference in the ratio referred to has 
been found in a series of experiments to be as much as 5 per cent. In conse- 
quence of this factor alone with the same total weight of grain and straw on unit 
area the yield of grain was more than 10 per cent, greater in some such races 
than in others. 

In the case of hybrid races generally the number of individuals possessing 
different combinations of characters is very large, especially if minor characters 
affecting either productivity or quality are taken into account. The experi- 
mental error involved in selecting either individual plants, or aggregates which 
are the progeny of single self-fertilised plants, for the purpose of starting new 
races of cereals is so great in consequence of environmental conditions that no 
conclusions of practical value can be drawn, except from a very large number of 
observations, as to relative productivity when only the dry weight of the grain 
is taken into account, and then only if special methods of cultivation are 
adopted. 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION M. 661 

In the initiatory stages of new races it becomes, therefore, impracticable with 
any certainty to extract the most productive races from those originated by 
artificial crossing by the merely empirical methods hitherto adopted. 

The paper described the methods adopted in collaboration with Professor 
Biffen, and, in respect of the biometrical data obtained, with Mr. W. E. Gosset, 
and gave a summary of the conclusions arrived at from the experiments of the 
last five years ; more particularly as to the value for selection purposes of accu- 
rate determination of the relative seed-forming energy as shown by the ' co- 
efficient of migration ' of different races of barley. 

2. Wheat Improvement in Australia. By F. B. Guthbie, F.I.C. 

Part I. 

Early inter-State action with regard to the study of wheat and its diseases 
was reviewed, and it was shown how the original scheme developed. 

The work of private individuals, working before State action was 
inaugurated, was discussed, and in particular the present position of the Farrer 
wheats was dealt with. 

The special qualities looked for in wheats to be grown under Australian con- 
ditions were grouped under the following heads : — 

(1) Resistance to rust and other diseases. 

(2) Prolificness. 

(3) Drought resistance. 

(4) Milling quality. 

(5) Wheats for hay. 

(6) Wheats for different districts and climates. 

It was shown how the interpretation placed on the above terms in Australia 
differs from that which obtains in other countries on account of the differing 
conditions ; for example, wheats which resist rust locally succumb to this disease 
when grown in other parts of the world; some of the most prolific European 
varieties are very poor yielders when grown locally, &amp;c. 

The characteristics enumerated above were next considered more in detail. 

(1) Resistance to Rust, ct-c— The principal workers on this subject were 
referred to. The point was noted that the nature and life-history of rust were 
different in Australia. The question of rust-escaping by quick maturing was 
dealt -with, and the damage done by rust in Australia, especially in the coastal 
districts, was discussed. 

Remarks followed on some rust-resistant wheats. 

(2) Prolificness.— The importance of this quality from a farmer's point of 
view. In the older wheats prolificness was very frequently associated with 
inferiority in other respects. The smalliiess of local yields was considered in 
comparison with other countries. The characteristics required in a prolific 
wheat were reviewed and some successful new varieties described. 

(3) Drought Resistance. — It was shown that this property is of the greatest 
local importance in view of the extension of wheat-growing into drier areas. 
The characteristics to be looked for in dry country wheats were discussed, and 
some successful new varieties described. 

(4) Milling Qualities. — The different requirements of English and Australian 
millers were referred to, and the characteristics of a good milling wheat for 
Australian conditions discussed. The export and internal trade were reviewed, 
and it was shown that there is a steady improvement in the quality of our 
locally grown wheat. Notes followed on some of our best-milling wheats. 

Part II. 
The work done in the individual States in the improvement of wheat was 
reviewed under the following headings :— 

(1) Work done by individual investigators. 

(2) Work carried out at institutions under departmental control. 

(3) Action taken by the different States in furtherance of the object of 
improving wheats.

3. William Farrer's Work, Methods, and Success : a Short Sketch. 

By J. T. Peidham. 

Farrer, the famous wheat-breeder, was born in England in 1845 and had 
a distinguished career at Cambridge. He emigrated to Australia for health 
reasons, and after practising as a surveyor he started his wheat-breeding experi- 
ments on his own property at Lambrigg, New South Wales, in 188C. In 1898 
he became wheat-breeder to the State Department of Agriculture and was 
actively engaged in this great work till the day of his death in 1906. 

What first attracted his attention to wheat improvement was the damage 
done for a number of years by rust {Puccinia graminis), and he set 
himself the problem of producing a rust-resisting variety. Other features which 
he aimed at securing were greater flour-strength, drought-resistance, early 
maturity, freedom from shelling, suitability for hay-making, and immunity to 
bunt {Tilletia tritici). Prolificness he regarded as of secondary importance, 
although this is the leading characteristic of his most popular variety, ' Federa- 
tion.' He seems to have thought that proper attention to cultivation, manur- 
ing, &amp;c., were of more importance in securing high yields than the actual 
prolificness of a particular variety. 

Cross-breeding followed by selection from the varying progeny formed the 
basis of all Farrer's work, and he usually made between 200 and 400 crosses in 
each year after joining the Department. The varieties used in addition to the 
best local ones were chiefly of the Fife type from Canada and the United 
States to impart strength, and Indian varieties to give early maturity and 
capacity for holding the grain after rii^ening. The selection of the best cross- 
breds and the elimination of the unsuitable ones presented the greatest diffi- 
culties he had to encounter. He was greatly helped in this by the setting-up 
of a miniature flour-mill under the superintendence of Mr. F. B. Guthrie, the 
departmental chemist ; for this made it possible to determine accurately the 
milling and baking qualities of very small samples of grain, any varieties not 
coming up to a certain standard Iseing immediately rejected. He kept well 
abreast of the current literature on the subject, and although during his later 
years he was in correspondence with Professors Biffen and Spillman on the 
subject of Mendelism he did not see his way to alter his methods materially, 
except, perhaps, in reducing the number of crosses made. 

II is work proved successful beyond his wildest dreams, though it was only 
partially appreciated at the time of his death. His greatest popular success is 
' Federation ' — a variety first introduced to the farming public about 1901 and 
now the most extensively grown and prolific of any in Australia. It is a cross 
between ' Purple Straw,' one of the best all-round local varieties up till Farrer's 
time, and a Fife-Indian cross-bred called 'Yondilla.' In addition, he has pro- 
duced varieties (' Comeback,' ' Bobs,' and ' Cedar ') of much greater flour- 
strength than any previously grown; varieties relatively immune to rust 
('Warren ' and ' Thew '), suitable to the moister districts near the coast; varieties 
not subject to bunt (' Florence,' ' Genoa,' and ' Cediar '), early-maturing varieties 
—some of them suitable for hay-making, like ' Firbank ' and ' Bunyip,' and most 
of them hold their grain better and are more suitable to Australian harvesting 
methods than the majority of the older varieties. Since his varieties have come 
into general use the growth of wheat has extended into drier and drier districts 
and a new province has been added to the ' wheat-belt ' in New South Wales, 
•while the average milling and baking qualities of Australian wheat have 
improved year by year. 

In the opinion of the author the main factors which contributed to Farrer's 
success were his keen enthusiasm, perseverance, thoroughness, and singleness 
of aim, coupled with the assistance of the Government, which caused the new 
varieties to be thoroughly tested and finally introduced to the farmers.

5. Wheat-Breeding in Australia. By A. E. V. Eichardson, M.A., B.Sc. 

Wheat is the staple crop of Australia. Steady increase in production has 
taken place during the past three decades, and the annual production is now 
approximately 100 million bushels. The greatest increase has taken place during 
the past decade, the area of land under wheat for grain rising from 5^ million 
to 7^ million acres, and the production from 50 million to 100 million bushels. 
The factors mainly responsible for this increase are the opening up of lands 
hitherto regarded as unsuitable for wheat-culture, the adoption of labour- 
saving machinery and improved methods of culture, and the introduction of 
improved varieties of wheat. 

Hitherto, attention has been mainly directed to the improvement in the 
plant's environment, as contrasted with the improvement in the plant itself. 

The future magnitude of the wheat industry of Australia depends on the 
extent to which lands lying outside the existing margin of cultivation can be 
profitably farmed. These are the semi-arid areas, and, to make them fully 
productive, drought-resistant prolific types are urgently required. 

In the three principal wheat States, New South Wales, Victoria, and South 
Australia, wheat-breeding is an important activity of the local Department of 
Agriculture. Each St&lt;at6 has a central station at which wheat-breeding is con- 
ducted, and subsidiary farms at which new selected cross-bred varieties are 
tested. At these centres considerable progress has been made in the production 
of more prolific types by — 

(1) The isolation of pure strains and mutants of high yielding capacity from 
the locally grown types ; 

(2) The deliberate improvement of existing types by individual and mass 
selection ; 

(3) The introduction and acclimatisation of foreign wheats; 

(4) The improvement of selected local types by intercrossing and by crossing 
them with acclimatised foreign types. 

A summary of this work was submitted. 

Farrer has conclusively demonstrated by cross-breeding that the production 
of varieties of high prolificacy, of high milling and baking quality, and of a 
high immunity from disease, is a practical certainty. The varieties 'Federation.' 
'Bobs,' 'Cedar,' and ''Comeback,' 'Florence' and 'Genoa,' may be taken as 
illustrations in point. 

There is reason for believing that the drought-resisting qualities of proved 
Australian varieties could be greatly increased by using as foundation stocks 
wheats grown for generations under extremely arid conditions. Certain crosses 
of Durum and Indian wheats with prolific local types have resulted in the 
production of early-maturing, spare-stooling, drought-resistant types bearing a 
high proportion of grain to straw. 

Modern genetic research has thrown considerable light on the mode of 
inheritance of certain unit characters in wheat, but most of the characters 
hitherto studied are of little practical importance. The practical objectives 
from an Australian standpoint are the raising of prolific, drought-resistant, 
early-maturing types, immune from fungoid diseases. To these may be added 
strength of flour and high milling quality. We require to determine what are 
the various factors on which these important qualities depend, their mode of 
inheritance, and how they can be brought under control and associated together 
at the breeder's will.

Joint Discussion with Section B {Chemistry) on Metabolism, opened by 
Professor H. E. ARMSTRONa, F.R.S. 

Professor Armstrong : In the time at disposal only broad issues could 
be considered. Many attempts had been made of late years to prove that 
formaldehyde is the initial product of assimilation. Apart from the unsatis- 



664 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION M. 

factory character of the evidence adduced, proof that it is present in the livinp; 
plant can never be proof that it has been formed in the up-grade process of 
assimilation, as there is reason to believe that it is a constant product of down- 
grade metabolism. However formed, its properties are such that it can never be 
present in more than minimal quantities; moreover, the fact that proof cannot 
be given that it is formed initially is of little consequence, as it is scarcely 
required, there being no other way apparently of accounting for the assimilation 
of carbon dioxide except the assumption that it is initially reduced to formic 
acid and then to formaldehyde. As to the manner in which carbonic acid under- 
goes reduction in plants, it is probable that water is ' electrolysed ' under the 
influence of light and chlorophyll, the one product being oxygen, which is 
evolved, perhaps, under the influence of a catalase, the other hydrogen, which 
is gripped temporarily by the chlorophyll and then used in reducing the carbonic 
acid. To assign a secondary part to chlorophyll and to regard iron salts as 
the primary agents, as Moore has done, is to overlook all that is known of the 
former substance and of the function of iron salts. 

To account for the formation of optically active dextroglucose in the plant, 
to take only one example, it is necessary to suppose that the polymerisation of 
formaldehyde is a directed process : probably it is formed against a sugar 
template, maybe under the influence of an enzyme. The enzymes, in fact, are 
to be regarded not only as hydrolysts but also as the primary formative agents 
of all directed metabolism. The manner in which they act reversibly may be well 
illustrated by reference to the behaviour of lipase. (Curves were exhibited 
showing the manner in which the synthetic and hydrolytic activities of lipase 
come to an equilibrium in presence of various amounts of water; it is most 
effective as a synthetic agent in the absence of water, a small proportion of 
water having a great effect in reducing the synthetic activity of the enzyme.') 

The enzymes are rigidly selective agents. They appear all to be colloid 
materials, and therefore cannot be regarded from the same point of view as 
ordinary hydrolytic agents such as the acids; much confusion has been caused 
by the introduction of complex mathematical considerations in explanation of 
their action. Apparently they act at approximately linear rates, but as one or 
more of the products of change exert a retarding influence, the ajiparent rate of 
change is more nearly of a logarithmic order. 

Though starch is the first obvious product of assimilation, there is no reason 
to suppose that it is a necessary stage in the formation of the other carbohydrates 
met with in plants, as in monocotyledons and not a few other plants it only 
occurs in the guard cells and then only in minute amounts. Brown and Morris 
have, in fact, argued that cane sugar is the primary product of carbohydrate 
metabolism. A very thorough study of the problem is now being made at 
Rothamsted by Mr. Davis and others which promises to be of importance, 
especially as particular care is being taken to devise accurate methods of 
analysis. In no case has starch been found in mangold leaves except at a very 
early period, though cane sugar is always present together with invert sugar"; 
apparently cane sugar wanders directly from the leaf into the bulb ; maltose has 
never been detected, though specially looked for, so that it is probable that cane 
sugar is formed directly, not from maltose. 

Reference was made to the great importance to the agriculturist of exact 
methods of analysis and of knowledge based thereon of the composition of 
fodder crops : it was to be supposed that much could be done to improve the 
quality of the various crops if once the general character of their metabolism 
were established. Improvements in the methods recently effected at Rothamsted 
were then briefly described — particularly the method which Mr. Davis had 
introduced of estimating starch with the aid of Taka-diastase, whereby a mix- 
ture of maltose with glucose is produced instead of a mixture of maltose 
with dextrins of uncertain properties. To determine maltose with accuracy, 
Mr. Davis uses yeasts which were known to act selectively on this sugar 
(Saccharomyces exiguus, S. Lvdwigii, &amp;c.). Incidentally, in the course of this 
work, the important fact has been established that yeasts which do not hydro- 
lyse maltose also cannot assimilate ; the contrary results of previous workers 

1 Cf. Armstrong and Gosney, Proc. Roy Soc. Series B, 1914. 



TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION M. 665 

are to be explained by tbe presence of a protein impurity in the maltose used. 
With the aid of such yeasts it has been possible to show that even in plants 
such as the Potato, the Turnip, and the Nasturtium, which contain much starch 
in their leaves, maltose is never formed as a down-grade product of metabolism. 
Professor Armstrong took exception to Dr. Petrie's conclusion that certain 
plants contained hydrogen cyanide in the free state : he regarded its presence 
as an impossibility and thought that probably in such cases the glucoside and 
enzyme were not separated so effectively as they are in most plants, so that 
tliey came together very readily on the cessation of metabolism. 

(i.) Feeding Statistics and Starch Equivalents. 
By Professor T. B. Wood, M.A., and G. Udny Yule, M.A. 

The authors have made a statistical study of the results of about 400 feeding 
trials collected and tabulated for the Highland and Agricultural Society by 
H. Ingle. 1 The trials were all carried out with oxen or sheep in Great Britain 
before the year 1907. Some of them go back to the year 1839. Examination 
of the results has yielded the following conclusions : — 

1. When the diet of oxen or sheep is increased above maintenance require- 
ments the law of diminishing return asserts itself, and successive increases in 
the diet do not produce proportional increases in live weight. 

2. As the diet is increased above maintenance requirements a smaller propor- 
tion of each successive increase is converted into live weight, and consequently a 
larger proportion is lo.st as heat. 

3. When oxen or sheep in store condition are given a diet which supplies 
considerably more food than is required for maintenance the proportion of tbe 
excess of food above maintenance requirements which is converted into live 
weight continuously falls as fattening proceeds. 

4. From the above conclusions it follows that there is not a direct proportion- 
ality between the amount of food above maintenance requirements calculated as 
starch equivalent and the live-weight increase produced. 

5. The figures from which Kellner's starch equivalents were calculated show a 
direct proportionality between the amount of starch equivalent above mainten- 
ance requirements and the live-weight increase produced. 

6. The discrepancy is explained by the fact that Kellner's results were 
obtained by feeding animals in store condition for short periods during which 
they never approached what the butcher calls ripeness, whilst in the British 
trials the animals were fed for several months until they were ripe for the 
butcher. 

7. It is by no means rare to find individual oxen which on an average fatten- 
ing ration of 8-5 lb. of .starch equivalent above maintenance requirements make 
daily live-weight increases as large as 3 lb. or as small as 1 lb. The former 
should give out 17,000 cal. per day, the latter 22,000 cal. per day, a difference of 
about 25 per cent. It should be possible to detect differences of this order by 
measurements of skin temperature. 

(ii.) Fattening Capacity and Shin Temperature. 
By Professor T. i3. Wood, M.A., and A. V. Hill, M.A. 

Tlie authors have measured the skin temperatures of eighteen oxen which had 
been on a fattening diet for ten weeks at the Norfolk Agricultural Station. 
The measurements were made by means of a thermopile connected to a sensitive 
galvanometer. The following results were obtained : The average skin tem- 
perature of eight animals which had during the last three weeks made average 
daily increases in live weight of 2-7 per head was 69 scale divisions above air 
temperature. The average skin temperature of five animals which had during 
the same period increased less than '8 lb. per head per day was 78 scale divisions 
.'ibove air temperature. The good doers had cooler skins than the had doers by 
nine scale divisions, which corresponds to approximately 3° C.

Fnrfcher discussion : — 

Prof. W. A. Osborne : Investigation of skin temperatures has a quite 
different significance when the shade temperature of the air is equal to the 
normal temperature of the animal. In this case, even in the driest-skinned 
animals the skin temperature is generally below that of the air. When the 
shade temperature of the air is higher than that of the animal the skin tempera- 
ture may be higher than that of the internal organs. 

Thickness and texture of coat and thickness of skin are factors of some 
importance. 

Prof. B. Moore : In the photosynthetic processes by which aldehyde is first 
formed the association of colloidal iron salts with the colourless organic portion 
of the chloroplast plays a distinct part. The metabolic conversions occurring in 
plants and animals from one type of carbohydrate to another are not diflBcult to 
account for by simple enzyme action because the energy charges are so slight, 
but the synthesis in the metabolic processes of protein and fat from carbo- 
hydrates requires a linkage and co-ordination of an endothermic with an 
exothermic reaction, such as has never been observed with a simple enzyme. For 
such synthesis an adsorption of enzymes into the cell protoplasm is required so 
as to furnish a colloidal regulating mechanism able to alter its activities from 
one time to another, and to build up or break down according to the demands 
of metabolism. 

In certain invertebrates and fishes there is an excessively low rate of 
metabolism, and a relatively enormous portion of food energy is thrown into the 
metabolism of the sex organs in such animals, as compared with the somatic 
metabolism. 

Mr. G. P. Darnell- Smith : The first visible product of assimilation in 
plants is starch, and the absence of visible starch in a plant does not show 
that it is incapable of forming it, but that its metabolic processes and its rate 
of translocation are so rapid that there is no need for starch to be deposited. 
For starch is to be regarded, not as a first product of assimilation, but as a 
substance that is thrown down temporarily by rapidly assimilating plants until 
such time as the plant is able to deal with its translocation. Brown and Morris 
regarded cane sugar as the first product of assimilation, but a critical examina- 
tion of their experimental results fails to carry conviction. 

As regards enzyme action confusion is introduced by comparing it with, for 
example, the rate of hydrolysis produced by acid. It has to be remembered 
that an enzyme is a colloid, and that the action of a colloid is determined by its 
previous history. Unless the previous history of a colloid is known, its 
action cannot be predicted ; hence a portion of any particular colloid under 
particular conditions will act in a different manner from another portion of the 
same colloid (but with a different previous history) under the same particular 
conditions. 

Mr. D. McAlpine : The question whether chlorophyll has any action in the 
green plant in the absence of sunlight is uncertain. Its photosynthetic activity 
is probably slight, yet it is found where sunlight could not possibly penetrate, 
as, for example, in the so-called fruit of the yew, the seeds of the lemon, and in 
the conducting parenchyma throughout the tissue of the apple. 

(iii.) The Distribution of Nitrogen in the Seedx of Acacia Pycnantha. 
By Dr. J. M. Petrie and Dr. H. G. Chapman. 

The seeds of a pycnantha which have been dried in the air contain 4'5 per 
cent, of nitrogen. If the testa be removed the seed contains 5-5 per cent, of 
nitrogen. The nitrogen is present partly as protein and partly as various organic 
compounds. 

The nitrogen present as protein forms 55 per cent, of the total nitrogen. The 
protein soluble in water contains 26 per cent, of the total nitrogen ; that soluble 
in 10 per cent. NaCl 13 per cent, of the total nitrogen, and the remainder 
could not be extracted. Protein soluble in alcohol is absent. Protein coagu- 
lable by heat contains 10 per cent, of the total nitrogen. 

The nitrogen present after precipitation with 80 per cent, alcohol amounts to 
45 per cent, of the total nitrogen. 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION M. 667 

Of the non-protein nitrogen, 10 per cent, is driven off by distillation with 
magnesia and 18 per cent, is precipitated by phosphotungstic acid. 

After hydrolysis of the solution of non-protein nitrogen with dilute acid for 
two hours, the amount of nitrogen distilled over with magnesia is 10 per cent, of 
the non-protein nitrogen, but if now the hydrolysis be repeated another 10 per 
cent, of the non-protein nitrogen distils over. If hydrolysis be long continued, 
the amount of nitrogen that can be distilled over with magnesia rises to over 
30 per cent, of the non-protein nitrogen. 

If the non-protein solution be hydrolysed for two hours with dilute acid, then 
nitrous acid liberates nitrogen corresponding to 66 per cent, non-protein nitrogen. 
If, however, the hydrolysis be repeated long enough the liberation of nitrogen by 
nitrous acid diminishes to zero. 

With Sorensen's method of titration no fixation of formaldehyde by amino- 
groups occurs. 

The attempts to isolate amino- acids invariably resulted in the discovery of 
traces. 

The amount of purin nitrogen present is small, less than one per cent.

1. Bacterial Toxins in Soils. By E. Gkeig-Smith, D.Sc. 

If the soil-water is considered as a medium for the growth of bacteria, it 
should contain not only the nutrients that favour bacterial growth but also the 
waste products of their vital activity. And if we reason from what we know 
about the growth of bacteria in other media, we should expect that some of 
these waste products are injurious to the bacteria producing them. Further- 
more, in a mixed flora, certain groups should produce injurious substances in 
greater amount, and these should differ in degree in their action upon bacteria 
of their own group or of other groups. For convenience, these injurious sub- 
stances are called toxins. Certain investigators deny the presence of toxins 
in soils, although they admit the presence of inhibiting substances, It is 
difiBcult to account for the discrimination. 

The multiplication of bacteria in the soil will among other conditions depend 
upon the relative preponderance of the nutrients over the toxins ; and, with 
the other conditions remaining constant, an ultimate equilibrium should be 
established between the nutritive and the toxic effects. An alteration of the 
other conditions will disturb the equilibrium, and the bacteria will increase or 
decrease until another balance is established. 

In demonstrating the presence of bacterial toxins in soils, I have made use 
of aqueous extracts of soils which after filtering through porous porcelain have 
been seeded with known quantities of bacteria. Generally, Bac. prodigiosus has 
been employed as a test organism. It is more sensitive than mixtures of soil 
bacteria, and is easily grown, detected, and counted. Tests have shown that 
extracts which destroy Bac. prodiqiosus retard the growth of mixed soil-bact«ria. 
We are justified in considering that an extract which destroys Bac. prodigiosus 
is also capable of destroying some of the soil-bacteria. 

The bacterial toxins are not always easily demonstrated, as they are fre- 
quently overshadowed by the soil-nutrients, but investigation has pointed out 
some of the conditions under which they may not be expected to show a direct 
action in soil-extracts. For example, they are destroyed by exposing the 
soil to the sun, by heating the soil, by storing the soil in the air-dry condition ; 
they decay rapidly in aqueous solution, and are destroyed upon boiling. They 
are soluble in water and are washed out of the soil by rain. Direct evidence 
of their presence should not, therefore, be expected in arid soils, in soils during 
a drought or in soils after rain. Much of the so-called fertilising effect of the 
sun may be due to the destruction of the soil-toxins. Indirect evidence of their 
presence is easily obtained by boiling the soil-extract, seeding it with bacteria, 
and comparing the growth with that obtained in the unboiled extract. A 
greatly increased growth of bacteria is usually obtained in the boiled extract. 
A direct diminution is only obtained under certain conditions. These have 
not been fully investigated, but enough has been done to show that one of 



668 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION M. 

these depends upon the ratio of the soil to the water used for extraction. 
Equal parts of soil and water — that is, 100 grams of soil and 100 c.c. of water — 
generally give the maximum toxic effect. 

The toxic effect is not evident after rain, but becomes pronounced after a few 
days of dry weather. Similarly, a soil which has been extracted with water, 
and found to be toxic, will, upon further extraction, give a nutritive extract. 
If the same soil, after extraction, be incubated at 22° for some time and then 
extracted with water, the extract will be found to be toxic. Thus toxins are 
developed upon incubating a nutritive soil. 

While the extracts of soils show an enhanced nutritive effect after boiling, 
those of the subsoil become more toxic. It appears, therefore, that there are 
at least two kinds of toxins in soils — one, predominating in the soil, is thermo- 
labile; the other, predominating in the subsoil, is thermostable. 

The action of the volatile antiseptics upon soils is to so alter them that, while 
before treatment they yielded extracts directly bacteriotoxic, after treatment the 
extracts became nutritive. Thus the partial sterilisation of soils, whether by 
heat or by volatile antiseptics, causes them to give extracts, in which there can 
develop a greater number of bacteria. 



2. A Review of Work on Soil Inoculation. 
By J. GoLDiNG and H. B. Hutchinson. 

Since the introduction of pure cultures of nodule bacteria for soil inoculation 
by Nobbe and Hiltner in 1895 a vast number of field experiments has been 
carried out in different countries and with a great variety of inoculating 
material. 

The results of such experimental work were in the first instance most 
discouraging, and it is only within the last few years that the conditions deter- 
mining success or failure have been adequately recognised. During this time 
the relations existing between the host plant and the nodule organism and 
between the organism and artificial media used for cultivation in the laboratory 
have been studied in detail, and in the light of these investigations it is not 
surprising that failure attended much of the preliminary and often haphazard 
field work. Experience has shown that it is not sufficient to have a pure and 
active culture in order to attain success in soil inoculation, but that the soil 
itself shall be suitable for the growth and continued existence of the introduced 
organism, and that the supply of mineral nutrients shall not be the limiting 
factor in the growth of the plant. Liming has been required in many cases, 
and with a proper recognition of the now known essential conditions the number 
of successful cases of inoculation trials has steadily increased during recent years. 

Comparative work with pure cultures and inoculation by means of soil which 
has previously carried a specified leguminous crop have shown in the majority 
of cases the superiority of the latter, and cultivation in the laboratory has 
latterly included the use of soil media or soil itself, since the organism appears 
to retain its power of infection to a greater extent in this than in other media. 

The use of pure cultures possesses advantages on the score of cheapness and 
convenience, which are sometimes of distinct value, and recent work especially 
has shown the danger attending transference of plant diseases in soil used for 
legume inoculation. The relations attending infection of the plant and subse- 
quent mutual existence are very complex, and future experimental work in 
preparing cultures must aim at reproducing these conditions in order to permit 
of the production of cultures in active growth and possessing great virulence. 

Such work, however, involves accurate scientific control if it is to be of 
permanent benefit to science and agriculture, and in itself would tend to check 
the production of commercial cultures of doubtful origin and hypothetical value. 



3. The Effects of Caustic Lime and of Chalk on Soil Fertility. 
By H. B. Hutchinson and K. MacLennan. 

Bacteriological, chemical, and pot-culture investigations with the two forms 
of lime have shown their action on the soil to be essentially different. The 



TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION M. 669 

former possesses the essential properties of a mild antiseptic, and if applied in 
sufficient quantity is capable of giving rise to the usual phenomena of partial 
sterilisation. When this point has been reached there occurs an initial decrease 
in the numbers of bacteria, followed by large increases, the larger forms of 
soil protozoa are killed, and there is a cessation or limitation of nitrate formation. 
The form of available nitrogen in such soils is largely that of ammonia, which 
leads to increased nitrogen content of plants growing in such soils. 

Both above and below the partial sterilisation point the return of nitrogen 
as ammonia and nitrate within the first year is directly proportional to the amount 
of caustic lime applied, and if not assimilated by the crop is liable to loss by 
leaching before the following crop appears. This is advanced as an explanation 
of the unfavourable results sometimes observed in practice after heavy applica- 
tions of caustic lime. Lime in this form and about the partial sterilisation limit 
may be used for the suppression of insect pests in the soil. In common with 
chalk or limestone it also serves to correct an unfavourable reaction of the soil, 
thus ensuring more vigorous bacterial and plant growth. 

Three new methods have been worked out to ensure better control of the use 
of lime in field practice : (a) the determination of soil carbonates; (6) the deter- 
mination of the amount of caustic lime necessary to induce partial sterilisation, 
and to indicate the limit to which this form of lime can be applied without 
adversely affecting the following crop ; and (c) the estimation of the lime require- 
ments of soils for purposes of neutralisation, whether by means of caustic lime 
or carbonate. 

While the estimation of soil carbonates may provide useful information in 
some cases, the authors wish to lay especial emphasis on the desirability of 
determining the lime requirements of the soil, since a soil may contain "only 
tiar es of carbonate and still not be in need of lime applications. 



4. The Estimation of Condition in Cattle. By J. A. Murr.\y. 

In this paper it was argued : 

(1) That the verbal terms — fat, half fat, &amp;c. — used to describe the condition 
of cattle are vague and indefinite. 

(2) That all the varying degrees of condition can be expressed only by numerical 
values. 

(3) That condition is measured by the ratio of live weight to size. 

(4) That the size may be determined by the usual measurements of length and 
girth. 

(5) That the girth must be that of the animal in store condition. Under any 
other circumstances some allowance must be made for the increase in girth due to 
fattening. 

(6) That the condition of typical store animals should be taken as 100, and that 
of others p»'o rata. 

The arguments are embodied in the formula : — 

424-4 M 



;|,-^(M/^_17)} 

where is the condition, M the live weight (in pounds), and g the length and girth 
respectively (in inches). 

This formula is at present tentative, and is merely intended to show that the 
thesis is capable of practical application. The chief difficulty in the way of developing 
it is the unreliability of the accepted methods of measuring length. 

The paper was therefore mainly a plea for co-operation of cattle experts with a 
view to (1) agreement in regard to the methods of measurement, (2) accumulation 
of data relating to different types of animals.

Brisbane. 
F HI DAY, AUGUST 28. 
The President delivered the following Address : — 

The fact that this Address is to be delivered in the capital city of a State in 
which semi-tropical, and even tropical, conditions prevail suggests some con- 
sideration of the future of countries in which vegetative development, and 
therefore the production of food, can attain such a level as is possible here. 

At the outset let me remind you of two prime facts in the natural history of 
man. In the first place all civilisation is based upon food supply; no other 
industry is creative, and the wealth of a community might almost be measured 
by the amount of time that remains at its disposal after it has secured, either 
from its own land, or by exchange, the food it needs to live upon. Secondly, we 
must look forward at no very distant date, as the life of nations goes, to the 
exhaustion of those capital stores of energy in the world — coal and oil — on 
which the current industrial system is based. How long the stores may last 
is a matter of dispute, but 500 years is a liberal estimate, and we can be pretty 
sure, in a world in which prophecy is notoriously unsafe, that nothing remains 
to be discovered which can take the place of those savings from the energy of 
bygone epochs that are represented by coal and oil. With the passing of 
industrialism the importance of agriculture will grow, and while the world as a 
whole will still be able to support the same number of people as are fed by 
agriculturists of to-day, great readjustments of the population will have to 
be effected, according to the productive powers of the land in each country. 
Should population continue to increase, and the spread of organised and .stable 
government ensures that it will grow, there must come a demand for the better 
utilisation of the land, and for a higher production of food than at present 
prevails ; indeed, even in the last few years symptoms of this increasing demand 
for food have been in evidence. 

Let us see what the land can be made to do at the present time in the way 
of supporting population, and for that we must turn to the East, where long 
experience of the art of intensive agriculture goes hand in hand with an 
optimum climate and a population of maximum density. Rural Japan is 
reported to carry a population of 1,922 to the square mile, entirely supported 
by agriculture, but maintaining in addition its quota of officials and indus- 
trialists. Even this number is exceeded in China, where a farm of two-and- 
a-half acres will support a family of eight to ten people, and where, in some 
special cases, as on the island of Chungming, the population living wholly on 
the land may rise nearly to 4,000 per square mile. Compared with these figures 
the density of population on Western land is trifling. The United States is 
said to maintain no more than 61 per square mile of its cultivated land, 
England something over 90, Ireland about 120, and Belgium, perhaps the most 
intensely cultivated of European countries, not more than 200 per square mile 
of cultivation. Now, these enormous densities of rural population are accom- 
panied by a very low standard of living; the people, if strong and healthy, exist 
on the very margin of sustenance. To take a cash standard, an experienced 
rural labourer in China cannot command more than 6d. a day, on which he will 
support a family. But for this small pay of 6d. a full day's work will be 
obtained ; indeed, such a day's work as the white man would find it almost 
impossible to give under the climatic conditions prevailing. 

Such a state of continuous toil seems to be the necessary outcome of an 
individualistic system of farming in countries with no great industrial outlets, 
where the pressure of an increasing population results in continued subdivision 
of the land. Of its kind Chinese agriculture is magnificent, as far as one can 
judge from the accounts; the land is made to do an extraordinary duty, bearing 
two or three full crops a year ; waste is non-existent, and long experience has 
taught the farmers to anticipate in practice some of the most recent discoveries 
of science in the way of conserving and recuperating the fertility of the soil. 
Though no statistics are available, the land seems to have been raised to its 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 671 

highest level of productivity per acre, just as it has attained its maximum 
population-carrying capacity. 

Now the Australian, like other farmers in new countries, is often reproached 
for the low yields per acre that he obtains — 10 to 15 bushels of wheat per acre, 
as against 32 in England, and rather more in Holland and Belgium. Unfavour- 
able as is this comparison of Australia with Europe, still greater appears the 
superiority of China and Japan, though it cannot be reduced to statistics. But 
the Australian quite rightly replies by setting up another standard of com- 
parison ; not the production per acre, but the production per man is his 
criterion, and on this basis the Australian farmer takes a very high position 
indeed. Against the productivity of the land when labour is unlimited he 
opposes the ideal of the productivity of the man when aided by machines and 
unlimited land. 

Organised large-scale farming supports far more people than the labourers 
actually employed on the land ; it buys machines and raw materials like 
fertilisers, it pays rent and makes profits, all of which go to the support of other 
people, who are at bottom fed and maintained by the production from the land. 
I have calculated that the most highly cultivated farm with which I am 
acquainted in Britain, a farm selling merely meat, potatoes, and corn, would 
actually support people at the rate of over 1,000 per square mile, if they were 
to live at such a low subsistence level as that of the Oriental small farmers. 
The standard of living that in fact prevails is of course very different, but 
nevertheless, when all the exchanges of commodities and services against food 
are completed, that square mile of highly organised farm-land is the ultimate 
support of a population comparable with that resident on Eastern land even 
though the number of people actually tilling the soil is small enough. 

But even if the number of people maintained by a given area under Western 
conditions is far greater than would appear from those employed in cultivating 
the soil, there must come a time when the pressure of an increasing population 
will necessitate a much higher agricultural efficiency in the way of production 
of food per acre. Now, if we attempt to meet this pressure by subdivision 
of the land, attracted by the specious appearance of a large population sup- 
ported on the soil, the operation of competition will force them down to such 
a low standard of living as we find in China and Japan. A large number of 
men on the land does not necessarily make for more food for the community, 
because in practice we find that the standard of cultivation and production 
per acre of the small holder is a.ctually below that of the larger farmer in the 
same class of business. For example, one thousand acres might be cultivated 
by twenty men, so as to produce as much food as if it were divided up and 
made to carry 200 men on five acres apiece; the community, considered as a 
whole, is richer in the former case by the labour of 180 men, labour that can 
be devoted to the production of other articles which the small holders would 
have to go without. Clearly, if twenty men can grow a maximum of food on 
the thousand acres, it is mere waste to employ 200 men about it, though, at 
first blush, in the latter case, the land seems to be carrying ten times more 
men. The only question is whether the intensive cultivation, which is more 
or less forced upon the two hundred holders of five acres, can be obtained when 
the area is cultivated, as a whole, by only twenty men. There is no lack of 
evidence that it can, but the means by which such large-scale farming can in 
the end beat mere grinding human labour, is by utilising to the full all the 
resources of science, machinery, and organisation. In fact, when the world 
becomes fully populated, the application of science to agriculture is the only 
method by which the community can be saved from falling into the Oriental 
condition of a community of labourers working incessantly for a bare subsistence. 

Now, we may ask ourselves what remains for science to do towards the 
improvement of agriculture. Practically everything. Agriculture is half as old 
as man ; centuries of experience, of trial and error, of slowly accumulated obser- 
vations, are bound up in the routine of the commonest cultivation of the soil ; 
the science applied to agriculture is at the outside little more than a century 
old, and so far has only partially succeeded in explaining and justifying existing 
practices. It is still in the reign of first approximations to the truth ; these 
specious first approximations which so regularly break down when applied to

the real thing on a large scale, where the second or even the third terms really 
dominate the issue. The farmer is fond of reproaching the scientific men with 
the discrepancy between theory and practice ; there should be none if the theory 
is complete, but in such complex matters as the growth of plant and animal we 
are yet very far from being able to bring into account all the factors concerned. 
A shipbuilder, for instance, having built to a certain speed and measured off his 
distance on the map, may reckon on making his port on a certain day ; he finds 
himself wrong, because of the existence of a current which takes a knot or 
more off his speed. His theory was not wrong, only incomplete. Fuller know- 
ledge may map the currents and their velocity, but even the new calculation may 
be put out by some unexpected weather factor. Now the growth of a plant is 
determined by an infinitely more numerous and less measurable series of factors 
than the speed of a ship : small wonder then that the calculations based upon 
them are apt to be so erroneous. 

Imperfect as is our knowledge, yet we have progressed far enough to see in 
what directions fruitful work may be done, and may plan our campaigia of 
research. In connection with the soil, for example, the big problem is probably 
the prevention of the waste that goes on at an incrieasing rate as the soil becomes 
more enriched by the accumulation of organic matter. Many soil bacteria, as 
we know, deal with the compounds of nitrogen in the soil so as to set free 
nitrogen gas from them, all of which actions are sheer waste of the most 
valuable constituent of the soil, and to such an extent does this change take 
place that we cannot, as a rule, expect to recover in the crop more than one- 
half of the nitrogen contained in farmyard manure applied to the soil. Where 
the soil is rich, and a high level of production is being arrived at, the per- 
centage of waste may be even greater ; for example, on the 'Rothamsted wheat 
plot, which has received 14 tons of dung every year, only about one-quarter 
of the nitrogen applied in the manure has been recovered in the crop, and less 
than a quarter remains stored in the soil. When a hundred pounds of nitrate 
of soda per acre is applied, nearly the whole of the nitrogen it contains will 
be recovered in the increased crop ; with an application of 200 lbs. there may 
be a waste of 25 per cent, of the nitrogen, with still greater losses as the appli- 
cation is increased. The loss is not due to mere washing out of soluble 
materials, because it is greatest when the nitrogen is applied in organic manures. 
Under existing conditions, high productivity in the soil is associated with a 
high rate of waste, and nowhere is this more marked than 'when cultivation is 
carried on under tropical conditions, so that one of the chief difficulties of 
tropical and semi-tropical agriculture is to maintain the stock of humus and 
nitrogen in the soil. An illustration of the waste that so often goes on in the 
soil is furnished in the practice of the cultivators under glass in England. For 
the growth of cucumbers and tomatoes they are in the habit of making up a 
very rich medium, half soil and half dung, but after a very few crops they are 
no longer able to use this mixture profitably, but must throw it away and renew 
their beds, though the rejected soil is still extremely rich in the elements of 
plant food. The recent investigations at Rothamsted have shown that the 
fertility of this ' sick ' soil can be restored by merely heating it for an hour or 
• two to a tem.perature approaching that of boiling water, the cost of which 
operation is considerably less than that of renewing the soil. In this case the 
uselessness of the used soil appears not to be due to the" destruction of the 
nitrogen compounds, but to their retention in a condition unavailable for the 
plant. The nitrogen compounds have to be broken down to ammonia or nitrates 
before they can teed the plant ; this process is effected by certain groups of 
bacteria, the numbers of which are limited in the sick soil by the excessive 
development of another group of soil organisms — protozoa, amcebte, &amp;c., that 
feed upon the bacteria. 

We are only just beginning to take stock of all the changes in the soil 
materials that are effected by living organisms, some necessary, some com- 
petitors with the plant, some wasteful ; the ultimate problem is to bring these 
processes under control in the field as well as in the laboratory. The antiseptic 
treatment of the land at large, in the way in which we can now clean up soils in 
pots, may seem an impossible dream, but not more impossible than the pro- 
duction of a heavily yielding weedless field of wheat would have seemed to

primitive man. Already much may be done to set up a better microtlura and 
fauna in the soil by improving its physical conditions. The good effects of such 
processes as liming and drainage are largely due to the encouragement that is 
thereby afforded to the valuable org&lt;anisms. Soil inoculation with such neces- 
sary bacteria as those which fix nitrogen when living in the nodules on the 
roots of leguminous plants has been widely attempted, but with very little 
practical success. The failures have generally been due to the fact that soils 
from which the nodule organism is absent are without it because of some 
chemical or physical defect ; it is not sufficient merely to seed it with the 
organism ; the soil itself must first of all be brought into a fit state to maintain 
its existence. The best of grass seeds would be wasted imless the land on which 
they are sown is first made clean and fertile. The amelioration of soils on 
their physical side, by bringing clay and silt to the sands, sand and coarse 
particles of various kinds to the clays, will eventually be taken up on a great 
scale, now that engineering has made it possible to move earth wholesale by 
cheaper means than by primitive spade and cart. I have seen a cold clay 
carrying miserable pasture converted into good market garden land by nothing 
more than the application of a thick layer of town refuse and ashes ; only 
organisation is needed to make such processes economic, even when the imme- 
diate, and not the ultimate, return is reckoned. 

From the point of view of manures we shall have to look forward to an 
ultimate scarcity of nitrogenous fertilisers; the exhaustion of sodium nitrate is 
only a question of time ; the present sources of sulphate of ammonia will dis- 
appear with the coal, and the water power which is now giving us nitrate of 
lime and cyanamide will then be too precious to be used in making fertilisers. 
Even if the new process for the synthesis of ammonia j)roved as economical 
as is expected, we ought still to depend upon the natural processes of nitrogen 
fixation, and make the farm self-supporting as regards nitrogen at a high level 
of production. The clover crop in the rotation usually followed in England 
will, under present conditions, gather in enough nitrogen for the growth of 
about twenty-four bushels of wheat to the acre, an equal quantity of barley, 
and twelve tons of turnips. How can we similarly maintain production at a 
level of forty bushels of wheat, with other crops in proportion, yet without any 
nitrogenous fertiliser from outside ? 

A more immediate problem of the same kind is before the investigator; all 
around our great cities exist great market gardening industries, which have been 
built up by means of the cheap supplies of stable manure that were to be obtained 
therefrom. The market gardener close to London and as far afield as Bedford- 
shire, rendered thin sands and gravels fertile by using forty tons or more of 
London dung every year, but the advent of the motor car has curtailed, and will 
eventually put an end to, that supply, in which case how is the market gardening 
to be carried on? Nitrogen compounds and the other bare elements of plant food 
can be bought, but humus is also necessary to get these thin soils to yield a 
proper growth ; what needs to be worked out is the cheapest and most effective 
way of utilising leguminous green crops and the other nitrogen-fixing organisms 
of the soil to maintain the fertility of such land, keeping in view the fact that it 
cannot be thrown out of productive cultivation for any length of time. What is 
needed is not a field experiment merely, but a discussion of a whole system of 
cultivation on the economic as well as on the scientific side. This suggests the 
general consideration that economic research in agriculture is still in its infancy. 
How often do we find close at hand two farmers, both good practical men, 
with entirely divergent views on the rotation to follow or the management of 
their stock, one swearing by early maturity and a forcing diet, the other by 
cheap if slow production. The advantage of one system over the other is not 
a mere matter of opinion and personal idiosyncrasy, it is possible to reduce it to 
terms of pounds, shillings, and pence. The prime necessity is the application to 
farming of a system of costs book-keeping, such as prevails in a well-organised 
business. It is possible to obtain such figiires from a farm ; the method is as yet 
perhaps too complicated for the ordinary farmer to follow, but as an instrument 
of investigation in the hands of a teacher at one of the agricultural colleo-es it 
may be made to yield results of great value both to the individual farmer and to 
all those who have to take more general views of agriculture.

Eeturning to the purely scientific aspects of research, the whole of existence is 
based upon the fundamental process by which the green leaf utilises the energy 
of the light falling upon it to split up the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere 
and transform it into those fundamental carbon compounds— sugars, starches, 
&amp;c., which build up the substance of the plant. The animal creates nothing; it 
is only a transformer, and rather a wasteful one at that, of the_ compounds 
initially built up by the plant. Now, though the leaf is thus the prime creative 
force, it is yet a comparatively ineffective machine for dealing with the energy 
contained in the light, for it does not succeed in storing up in the shape of plant 
materials it produces as much as one per cent, of the energy that falls upon it as 
light, and in bright, tropical light the percentage utilised is even less. A steam 
engine, given a certain amount of energy in the shape of coal, turns out again 
about one-seventh of it in the shape of useful work; a gas or oil engine is an 
even more effective transformer. Can the duty of the leaf be increased so that it 
shall effect a greater production of dry matter for the amount of light energy it 
receives? We know very little as yet about even the sequence of chemical 
changes in the leaf beyond the fact that we begin with carbon dioxide and water 
and end with oxygen and some sort of sugar ; we are beginning to acquire know- 
ledge as to the extent the rate of change is affected by the supply of light, carbon 
dioxide, and water, and by the temperature. But we have now many examples 
in chemistry of reactions being speeded up or rendered more complete by means 
of some adjustment of the external conditions, so it is perhaps not too much to 
expect that this fundamental process of carbon accumulation may also be tuned 
up until the leaf becomes of greater efficiency than at present in producing tissue 
from the materials and energy supplied to it. 

Probably the most immediate successes are before the plant-breeder, now 
that the application of the jMendelian theory has provided a method which 
renders both speedy and certain the processes of crossing and selection whereby 
the practical men of the past, working almost at haphazard, have already 
effected such enormous improvements in our cultivated plants. Among cereals, 
the qualities in demand, qualities which we know to be obtainable, are resistance 
to disease, stiffness of straw, and a large migration factor. We want to get rid 
of the plant-doctor, as it were ; spraying and other prevention or curative treat- 
ments are both costly and of limited efficacy ; the desirable method is to keep the 
plant free of disease by means of a naturally resistant constitution, and by 
establishing healthy conditions of soil and nutrition. As to stiffness of straw, 
the incapacity to stand up is probably the chief cause which limits the yield of 
corn crops in Britain wherever the farming is high. When a man keeps much 
stock, and buys cake either for his bullocks, or to feed to his sheep on the 
turnips, the land becomes so rich that the first corn crop will only stand up under 
exceptionally favourable weather conditions, and the farmer, so far from buying 
more fertiliser, cannot take full advantage of what is already in the soil. The 
land is often rich enough to yield 60 bushels of wheat to the acre, but it is 
exceptional that a crop of such weight will stand up so that it can be harvested 
by a self-binder. Mr. Beaven, in this section, has already dealt with migration ; 
clearly it is a matter of great importance to the plant-breeder. Though the 
details have only been worked out for barley, the different varieties of any culti- 
vated plant, wheat for example, are very much alike as regards their gross 
productive power — i.e., the whole material grown weighs much the same in a 
dried condition. Even different crops produce much the same amount of dry 
matter when grown under the same conditions, this gross productive power being 
in all cases the similar product of the environment — i.e., the result arising from 
the supply of food, water, light, temperature, &amp;c. But granted that the different 
crops possess this same gross productive power, then their comparative usefulness 
depends upon the greater or less completeness with which they transform the 
crude material into products that may be used as food for man. In the cereals, 
for example, we want as much as possible of the original stuff manufactured 
by the leaf to be migrated later in the plant's life into the seed ; of the total 
weight of the crop we want the largest possible proportion to be high-grade grain 
and not low-grade straw. Mr. Beaven has shown that the various varieties of 
barley do differ constantly in their proportion of grain to straw, and as, without 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 675 

doubt, the same differences hold for other crops, this is a matter which must 
be watched by the plant-breeder. 

Cereals are not, however, the only materials upon which the plant-breeder 
has to work ; indeed, they are already among the most advanced of our domes- 
ticated plants, and the other farm crops require great improvement before they 
reach the level of wheat and oats. Sugar beet affords a most interesting case ; 
by selection the percentage of sugar contained in the root has been raised by 
one-half. The total amount of material grown per acre remains, however, much 
where it was, because of the difficulty — the impossibility in fact as yet — of testing 
the yielding capacity of a seedling root, whereas its sugar contents can be 
measured with ease. The same difficulty is seen among our other root crops ; such 
improvement as has been effected in the mangold, turnip, &amp;c., has chiefly been in 
the shapeliness and habit of growth of the root, these alone being the characters 
that are apparent to the selector dealing with a group of seedlings. To some 
extent these may be correlated with total yield, but how little may be judged 
from the fact that the long red mangold, one of the very oldest varieties, is still 
the largest producer of dry matter and sugar per acre. The comparative yield of 
cereal varieties may be tested by the growth of a few hundred plants under 
rigorous conditions ; some similar method will have to be worked out for root 
and fodder crops, before the plant-breeder can make much headway with them. 
Granted such a method, the plant-breeder has a fine, unexplored field before 
him in the leguminous and cruciferous fodder crops, and again in the fibre 
plants. Commercial flax, for example, is an entirely heterogeneous mixture of 
varieties, which never appears to have been subjected to the most ordinary 
selection. The fodder crops are matters of immediate importance, because the 
more intensive cultivation of the western side of Great Britain, where the high 
rainfall renders the growth of cereals a somewhat speculative industry _, subject 
to loss at harvest and difficulties in the spring preparations for sowing, depends 
upon the elaboration of a system of farming based upon rapidly growing fodder 
crops. At present these districts produce milk, meat, and store stock, mainly 
from grass land that gets but little aid from the cultivator. The gross pro- 
ductive power of such land is small, and under the plough can be enormously 
raised, but arable farming has hitherto been avoided, except at times of abnormal 
prices, because of the risks attending harvesting. With improved fodder crops 
in place of grain a more profitable system of husbandry would replace the crops. 
Again, a new country like Australia will have to evolve its own fodder crops to 
suit the climate, and its own soil-regenerating plants. 

Despite the fact that a given area of land will produce something like ten 
times as much human food of a vegetable nature as of meat and milk, if 
mere power of supporting life is considered, we may assume that the human race 
will not for a long time, if ever, turn to vegetarianism. Absolute pressure of 
population, supposing the maximum has to be supported that the land can be made 
to carry, would put an end to the preliminary conversion of vegetable into animal 
food, but it is probable that the dominant races will insist on remaining flesh- 
eaters even if that necessitates the limitation of their own numbers. However, 
the scientific man has at present little to say to this sociological question; his 
business is to make the animal a more efficient converter of coarse vegetable 
fodder into high-grade food. That there is plenty of room for development in 
this direction may be inferred from the facts that Professor Wood has called 
attention to in the paper he has recently submitted to this Section. What the 
grazier calls a good doer will lay on as fat and flesh twenty per cent, of the 
energy it receives in its food as against seven per cent, stored by a bad doer ; 
here is an enormous margin for improvement if the average cattle are only 
brought up to the level of efficiency of the best. No one has yet worked out the 
most economic rate of feeding for different classes of live stock, the type of 
ration that will produce the largest amount of meat from a given weight of food, 
independent of the rate at which the increase takes place. 

Granted the dependence upon research of the agriculture of the future if it 
is to meet the requirements of an increased population and a more advanced 
state of society, how can the required investigations best be organised ? We 
may take it for granted that in some form or other the State must find the 
funds ; in this connection at any rate there are no prizes for the private worker

676 TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION M. 

such as would make agricultural research a tempting, even a possible, com- 
mercial speculation. There is a very limited field for patents or royalties; the 
breeder of a new crop variety can only exploit it with success if he has some 
big commercial organisation behind him, and even then a very few seasons 
place it in everyone's hands. The solutions to most of the great outstanding 
problems which I have outlined above could not be sold at a price, howevni 
much they might improve the output of every farmer. Indeed, there is thi'S 
character about the advances which science may make in agriculture, and it 
explains the lack of interest in research exhibited by many hard-headed farmers, 
that the benefit comes to the community rather than to the individual. Farmer 
is competing with farmer, and if production is raised all round the price is 
apt to drop correspondingly, so that shrewd men who are doing very well as 
things are, are very content with their limited vision, provided the general 
ignorance remains unenlightened. However, we need not argue this point ; every 
civilised country has accepted the necessity of maintaining agricultural research ; 
even Great Britain, the last home of go-as-you-please, has fallen into line within 
the last year or two. 

Assuming that the State pays, shall the immediate organisation and control 
of the work remain with the State direct, or be placed in the hands of semi- 
official bodies like the Universities ? The character of the work required must 
settle this question. We may as well make up our minds at the outset that 
agricultural research is a very complex affair, which is going to arrive at com- 
mercial results very slowly. It deals with the fundamental problems of life 
itself ; its problems mostly lie in the border country where two or more sciences 
meet the debatable land which the man of pure science distrusts and affects to 
despise because there his clean and simple academic methods do not apply. 
Hence we have to attract to research in agricultural matters minds of the very 
best quality, men of imagination and determination, and give them scope and 
freedom to make the best of themselves. Now it has been recently claimed 
that the nation can only attract men of the necessary quality to research by 
instituting some system of prizes that shall be commensurate with the rewards 
that lie before the successful lawyer or business man who has embarked upon 
some competitive commercial career. I entirely dissent from this view ; the 
quality of a man's work is not to be measured by the results it happens to 
attain, for results are often matters of luck, but least of all is to be measured 
by the amount of public attention the results arouse. It is in the nature of 
some kind of discoveries to excite the popular imagination, but these discoveries 
do not necessarily involve more credit to the discoverer than many others whose 
burial-place in this or that volume of ' Transactions ' is only known to a select 
few. Once make publicity the criterion, and the scientific man is at the mercy 
of the boom and the advertisement; a good newspaper manner is more valuable 
than high thinking. Moreover, I would for the man of science say with 
Malvolio : 'I think nobler of the soul.' Give him a living wage and proper 
opportunities and he will give his best work without the added inducement of 
a chance of making his fortune. The real point is the living wage, and this 
does not mean the starveling price at which a man can be bought just after 
taking his degree. At present the career of research has some of the aspects 
of a blind-alley employment ; the young man enters on it with enthusiasm, only 
to find ten years later that he has no market value in any other occupation and 
that he is expected to continue on an artisan's wage. 

We have then to ensure the scientific man continuous employment; in such 
special subjects as agricultural science presents, we cannot trust to pick him 
for a particular job, and let him go when it is finished ; there must be some 
reasonable sort of a career in investigation. The State cannot simply pay for 
results ; men will not qualify for such precarious chances of employment. The 
great results come as incalculably as the great poetry, their value is similarly 
untranslatable into the cash standard, and though no provision of posts can 
ensure a supply of the finest flowers of the mind, routine science has this 
advantage over routine poetry, that it has some value and is even necessary 
to bring to fruition the advances of the pioneers. And when the great mind 
does happen to be born, he can only be turned to account if an organisation 
exists within which he ran find opportunities for work. Now such an organi- 



PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. 677 

sation seems to be provided by the Universities rather than by the State. The 
type of man who makes an investigator is apt to be markedly individual ; he can 
work better under the looser system of control that prevails in a University 
than under the official hierarchy of a Government department. The methods of 
research are anarchical, and ought to be continuously destructive of accepted 
opinions ; when a Government department takes an official point of view, it is 
apt to insist on its being respected and not criticised by its officers on the 
strength. It has happened within recent years that a scientific man in Govern- 
ment employment has had to choose between his salary and his conscience, and 
though University laboratories are not always temples of free thought, their 
atmosphere is distinctly more open than that of a Government office. The type 
of man most fitted for research is more attracted by a University than a depart- 
ment; he wants his value to be measured by the quality of his scientific work, 
rather than by his official adaptability. But the greatest objection to making 
research a function of Government is that it is of necessity subjected to an 
annual detailed justification of its expenditure to a non-expert legislative body. 
When one reads the cross-examination of this or that investigator by the 
Committee of Public Accounts of certain States which maintain departments of 
agricultural research, one realises the hopelessness of expecting the slow, far- 
reaching scientific work that ultimately counts from men who are subject to 
such an annual criticism. The almost complete sterility of certain State organi- 
sations for research on a great scale can be absolutely set down to the call that 
prevails for an annual report of results which seem to pay their way; only a 
talent for advertisement comes to the front under such a regime. Of course, a 
State must maintain laboratories which undertake a certain amount of investi- 
gation in connection with its duties in the control of disease, &amp;c., but, though 
it may be difficult to draw a defining line between research that arises out of 
administration and research in pursuit of knowledge, the distinction is easy to 
make in practice. For example, the State needs a veterinary laboratory for the 
purpose of checking the conclusions upon which the administrative regulations 
regarding this or that disease are based, and of testing serums, vaccines, and 
the like, but it would prove false economy in the end to entrust to this official 
institution the sole responsibility for investigations into animal diseases. 

Another advantage that arises from entrusting agricultural research to the 
Universities is that thereby one obtains the advice, and often the active co- 
operation, of men in the departments of pure science. I have already indicated 
how complex are the questions that agriculture raises ; the man who is working 
out soil problems may find one day that he is brought to a standstill by some 
physical or even mathematic difficulty he is not competent to deal with, on 
another occasion he may wish to consult a geologist, or again a zoologist. No 
soil laboratory pure and simple can afford to have men of all these qualifications 
upon its strength, but if it is attached to a University, its men are naturally 
in constant contact with other specialists from whom they may informally obtain 
the assistance they need. A special purpose laboratory must suffer if it is 
isolated from the general current of science, and this is particularly true of 
agriculture with its many contacts, and the natural inclination to locate its 
institutions in the country. Some link must be maintained between the research 
institution and the practical farmer, not so much for the sake of the latter, 
because he is rarely in a position to utilise directly, or even to understand, 
the work of the investigation, but in order to keep the work real and non- 
academic. Even from the purely scientific point of view the most fruitful lines 
of research are those suggested by practical life ; many effects that prove to be 
of fundamental importance to theory, only become apparent in the large-scale 
workings of the commercial undertaking. The contact with farming that the 
research-worker needs should be provided by his association with the University 
department that is teaching agriculture and advising the farmers of its district ; 
thus is established the connection that on the one hand brings the farmer's 
problems to the investigators, and on the other translates the investigators' 
results into practical advice. As I see it, the ideal organisation of research 
in agriculture is to associate a more or less specialised institution for the 
investigation of a particular class of problem with a University possessing an 
agricultural department, which is also charged with extension work by way 



678 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION M. 

of lectures and cadvice within its own sphere of influence. How specialised the 
institution may become must depend upon the numbers of Universities available, 
but there is a real economy in specialisation, in inducing each institution to 
throw its whole strength into one line of work, for Universities, like men, 
cannot afford to be Jacks of all trades. 

Many of my hearers may think I am sketching out a very ambitious and 
extensive programme about which the only certainty is the creation of a con- 
siderable number of salaried posts for men of science, but when I think of the 
futilities upon which so much public money is spent in every country, I am 
almost ashamed to justify the expenditure by pointing out that an increase of 
ten per cent, in any one of the staple crops of a country, such an increase as is 
well within the powers of the scientific man to effect in no great length of time, 
would pay over and over again for the organisation I have indicated. Even if 
the research went on for the sake of knowledge alone, every nation is able to 
allow itself a certain amount of intellectual luxury. Moreover, to return to 
my original text, it is only by the aid of agricultural science that the world is 
ultimately going to be allowed to enjoy any luxuries at all; as the fundamentally 
agricultural basis of society again becomes apparent, the one thing that will 
save it from sinking down into a collection of families each wringing a bare 
subsistence from a tiny plot of ground will be the application of the fullest 
knowledge to the utilisation of the land.

NARRATIVE AND ITINERARY OF THE AUSTRALIAN 

MEETING. 

Preliminary Arrangements. 

The Australian Invitation.— The possibility of a British Association 
Meeting in Australia was discussed there as early as 1884, and again in 
later years, but the time was not yet ripe. The question was once more 
raised, however, early in 1909, when Sir Charles Lucas, late of the 
Colonial Office, was visiting Australia ; and it was brought forward 
publicly on May 3, 1909, at a meeting of the Council of the University 
of Melbourne, by Dr. J. W. Barrett. As a result of his motion a 
committee was appointed in that University to formulate a scheme and 
take all necessary piTliminary action. This committee, of which the 
Pi-esideut-elect of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of 
Science (Professor Orme Masson) was Chairman, sought and obtained 
the cordial approval of its proposals by the other Australian universities 
and the leading scientific societies, and local committees were formed to 
co-operate with it in Sydney, Adelaide, and other centi-es. It was 
decided that the Commonwealth Government should be asked to 
father the invitation to the British Association and to grant a sum of 
£10,000 towards defraying the overseas expenses of the visit, that the 
State Governments should be asked to give free passes over their rail- 
ways, and that hospitality and other expenses should be guaranteed by 
local authorities and the general public. It was further decided that the 
invitation should be given for 191.3 or 1914, and that, following the 
example of the South African Meeting in 1905, the Association should 
not confine itself to one centre, but should visit each of the States in 
turn. 

Professor J. W. Gregory, who was visiting Melbourne, was 
informed of the Committee's proposals, and was thus enabled a few 
weeks later to bring the project under the notice of the General Com- 
mittee of the Association at the Meeting in Winnipeg (1909), where it 
was informally discussed with encouraging results. 

On December 16, 1909, a deputation, representing all the Australian 
bodies interested, waited on the Prime Minister, Mr. Alfred Deakin, 
who expressed cordial approval of the scheme, and promised to give it 
strong support. When, shortly afterwards, there was a change of 
Government, Mr. Andrew Fisher, who succeeded Mr. Deakin as Prime 
Minister, took the matter up with equal cordiality, and under his 
administration the proposals received the sanction of the Commonwealtli 
Parliament. The State Governments were also approached, and 
promised their support, especially in the matter of the free use of the 
railways. Finally instructions were given by the Prime Minister to 
Sir George Reid, High Commissioner for Australia, and Professor Orme 
Masson to convey the invitation from Australia to the Association, and 



680 NARRATIVE AND ITINERARY 

they did so at the meeting of the General Committee held in Sheffield 
on September 2, 1910. 

In anticipation of the invitation, the General Secretaries of the 
Association, in June 1910, had issued a circular letter addressed to 
Members of the General Committee and other representative Members, 
of professorial and similar standing, asking whether the recipients 
foresaw any possibility of attending a meeting in Australia or not. 
The proportion of Members who answered this inquiry in the affirmative 
was sufficient to warrant favourable consideration of the invitation. 
The General Committee unanimously accepted the invitation (after 
some discussion in private), and chose the later year offered (1914), 
having in view the consideration that the Association had tv/ice in recent 
years (1905 and 1909) met outside the United Kingdom. 

Commonwealth. Grant. — As already indicated, the Commonwealth 
Government guaranteed from the outset a substantial sum to be devoted 
exclusively towards the expenses of the voyage overseas incurred by 
representative scientific Members to be selected and invited by the 
Council of the Association. The General Officers of the Association, 
judging (as events proved, rightly) that a repi'esentative body could be 
gathered together larger than that for which the sum originally proposed 
would have afforded sufficient provision, took advantage of the occasion 
of Their Majesties' Coronation, when members of the Commonwealth 
Government were present in London, to discuss this matter with them. 
The suggestions then made from the point of view of the Association 
were received in the most generous spirit, and the Commonwealth 
Government subsequently increased its grant to £15,000, which was 
placed at the disposal of the Association under no other condition save 
that (in the words of a cablegram received by the High Commissioner 
from his Government in November 1912, and communicated by him to 
the Council of the Association) it was ' to cover passages of not less than 
150 official representatives, including selected Dominion and foreign 
scientists.' The allocation of this sum formed, as will be presently 
seen, the most important function of a Committee appointed by the 
Council to deal with arrangements for the Meeting; it may be stated 
here that the actual number of representative Members who benefited 
under the grant was 15.5 — approximately one-half of the Overseas 
Party. 

Letter to Universities. — No great amount of preliminary work was 
found necessary in London during the Council's sessions in 1910-12, 
though in June 1911 the Council authorised the General Secretaries to 
address a letter to universities and other educational institutions in the 
United Kingdom, requesting the authorities to do what lay in their 
power to relieve of examining and other duties, in July and September 
1914, any members of their teaching staff who might contemplate 
attending the Australian Meeting. The response to this request was 
favourable in the majority of cases, and very few instances came sub- 
sequently to the knowledge of the Association officers of Members 
prohibited by professional duties from accepting invitations to attend 
the Meeting. A letter in similar terms was sent independently by the 
Federal Council in Australia.

Australian Organisation, 1912-13. 

Local Committees and Officers. — Early in 1912 it was recognised 
in Australia that more definite and official machinery was now required 
for the organisation of the Meeting than had sufficed in the earlier 
stages. After consultation with those already chiefly concerned, the 
Prime Minister, Mr. Fisher, therefore gave instructions to 

Professor T. W. E. David, O.M.G., P.E.S., Sydney, 
Professor Orme Masson, P.E.S. , Melbourne, 
Professor E. C. Stirling, C.M.G., P.E.S. , Adelaide, 
Professor B. D. Steele, D.Sc, Brisbane, and 
Sir J. W. Hackett, K.C.M.G., Perth, 

to take the necessary steps. Each was asked to consult with the 
Governor of his State, the Premier, and the municipal and university 
authorities, and then to foi-m a large General Committee for his State, 
witli special sub-committees and an executive committee, and to arrange 
for the appointment of delegates, who, together with representatives 
of the Commonwealth Parliament, should form a Federal Council or 
central executive. At the same time the Prime Minister signified his 
approval of a suggested programme and itinerary for the Meeting, of 
the proposal mentioned above to increase the Commonwealth grant 
from £10,000 to £15,000, and of a suggestion to appoint a responsible 
official Organising Secretary. As a result of these instructions large 
committees were formed and met in each centre, and public interest was 
widely aroused. Each General Committee was under the presidency 
of the State Governor, and tlie following executive officers were 
appointed : — 

New South Wales : 

Chairman, Professor T. W. E. David, C.M.G., F.E.S. 

Secretary, J. H. Maiden, F.L.S. 

Treasurer, H. G. Chapman, M.D.

682 NARRATIVE AND ITINERARY 

Besides these, many other individuals did invahiable work before 
and daring the Meeting as officers or members of executive or of special 
sub-committees. 

The Federal Council held its first meeting at Melbourne in Novem- 
ber 1912, under the presidency of the Prime Minister, Mr. Fisher, with 
Mr. M. L. Shepherd as Secretary. A smaller Federal Executive 
(Professor Masson, Chairman) was then appointed, and the office of 
Organising Secretary was offered to and accepted by Mr. A. C. D. 
Eivett, D.Sc, of the University of Melbourne. Dr. Rivett's work in 
England during 1913, and subsequently in Australia, is referred to 
elsewhere. For fifteen months he devoted himself entirely to the 
duties of his office, and it is recognised by all concerned that the success 
of the Meeting was very largely due to him. In June 1913 Mr. Josej^h 
Cook succeeded Mr. Fisher as Prime Minister, and acted as President 
of the Federal Council until the close of the Meeting. 

From the end of 1912 till the Meeting in August 1914 a great deal 
of work devolved on the State Committees and on the Federal Council 
and its Executive, and many meetings were held. There was constant 
communication with the office of the Association in London and witli 
the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States. Some of the 
chief matters dealt with are referred to below. 

Local Costs of the Meeting. — Besides its contribution of £15,000 
for overseas travelling, the Commonwealth Government defrayed all the 
Organising Secretary's expenses and those connected with the work of 
the Federal Council. It also contributed largely to certain of the 
official entertainments during the Meeting. The State Governments, 
besides undertaking the whole cost of Members' railway travelling in 
Australia, contributed each a large sum towards the general expenses 
of the local meeting. 

Hospitality. — In each State a special Committee undertook to 
provide for the reception of each visiting Meml^er as a guest either at a 
private house or at n club or hotel. Apart from the executive officers 
already named, the following may be specially mentioned in this 
connection : — 

Adelaide : Sir Samuel Way, Bart. 
Melbourne : Mr. John Grice, Mr. D. J. Mahony. 
Sidney: Lady McMillan, Mrs. Ashburton Thompson. 
Bnshane : Sir Pope Cooper, Mr. F. Philpott. 

Excursions. — These were planned and carried out by special local 
Committees, with valuable assistance from the railway authorities and 
from the Automobile Clubs. The following, with the Executive 
officers, were mainly responsible for the Excvn'sion programmes: — ■ 

Perth: Professor Woolnough, Mr. C. Andrews. 

Adelaide: Mr. H. Angas Parsons, M.P. 

Melbourne: Dr. J. W. Barrett, C.M.G., and Professor E. W. 

Skeats, D.Sc. 
Sydney : Mr. Justice Docker, Mr. F. C. Covers. 
Brisbane : Sir Arthur Cowley, Mr. T. 0. Troedson. 



OF THE AUSTRALIAN MEETING. 683 

It is unnecessary to mention the many organisers and leaders of 
separate excursions. 

Railway Travelling. — A great deal of organisation was necessary to 
provide suitably for the sinmltaneous transport of so large a party of 
visitors in special trains, with sleeping accommodation and arrange- 
ments for meals, between the capital cities of the different States, which 
are separated by distances of many hundreds of miles. Arrangements 
had also to be made for the collection and separate transport of Members 
who arrived at various Australian ports apart from the main party, and 
for the return of Members to various ports after the conclusion of the 
Meeting. The handling and transport of large quantities of luggage 
had also to be planned. In connection with all such work the Com- 
mittees had invaluable assistance from the State Eailway Commis- 
sioners and their subordinate officers, and were specially indebted to 
the Chief Victorian Commissioner, Mr. W. Fitzpatrick. 

Facilities for Extended Travel. — Under this head may be included 
some of the longer organised excursions which were carried out during 
or immediately after the Meeting, such as those to the Broken Hill 
Mines and to Tasmania. But in addition the Federal Council under- 
took to provide facilities for any Member who might desire to devote 
himself for a time to special scientific work in Australia. Advantage 
was taken of this by not a few, though the War undoubtedly interfered 
with the plans of many. 

Accommodation for the Meeting. — All the Austrahan universities 
placed their buildings unreservedly at the disposal of the Committees. 
In the chief centres aiTangements were made to utilise the great halls 
as reception rooms, the Unions and club-rooms as luncheon rooms, etc., 
and to house each Section in a suitable lecture theatre with adjacent 
committee rooms. 

Work of the Sections. — Two local Secretaries were appointed for 
each Section, one in Melbourne and one in Sydney, for the purpose of 
providing suitable programmes of local work (as mentioned later) and 
making other arrangements in consultation with the Recorders. 

Handbooks. — A number of illustrated scientific handbooks were 
prepared in view of the Meeting. The chief of these was the ' Federal 
Handbook on Australia,' consisting of a series of monographs written 
by selected specialists. This volume was edited by the Commonwealth 
Statist, Mr. G. H. Knibbs, C.M.G., and published by the Common- 
wealth Government. A separate volume on similar lines, but of more 
limited scope, was issued by each State. A copy of each was presented 
to every visiting Member, and most of them were distributed in London 
beforehand. The Editors of the State Handbooks were : — 

So2dh Australia: Mr. D. J. Gordon and Mr. V. H. Ryan. 

Victoria: Mr. A. M. Laughton and Dr. T. S. Hall. 

New South Wales : Mr. R. H. Cambage and Mr. W. S. Dun. 

The Western Australian and Tasmanian books were in the hands of 
Committees. The Queensland book was a Government work published 
some time previously.

Home Organisation. 



The Home 'Australian Committee.'— By the time of the Dundee 

Meeting, 1912, an outline pTOgramme of the Austrahan Meeting was 
in being, and in the subsequent session of the Council Australian 
arrangements began to find an important place. In November 1912 
the Council appointed a Committee, ' to assist the President and General 
Officers in matters regarding the Meeting in Australia,' consisting of 
Professors A. Dend}^ J. W. Gregory, A. Liversidge, and E. Eutherford, 
to whom were subsequently added Professor W. Bateson and Professor 
0. J. Martin, while from October 1913 onward the Sectional Presidents 
appointed for the Meeting were also taken into consultation. This 
' Australian Committee ' held fourteen meetings between December 1912 
and March 1914. As has been indicated, its principal work was the 
allocation of grants out of the Commonwealth Fund towards the overseas 
expenses of Members. It was known to be the view of the Australian 
authorities that the invited representative Members should be involved 
in as little expense as possible beyond incidentals, and therefore it was 
determined that grants should be made at a uniform rate of £100 (the 
reduced return fare, first class, by the Suez route, excepting certain 
special cases, such as that of invited members travelling from coun- 
tries less distant than the United Kingdom fi'om Australia, to whom 
smaller grants were made. By February 1913 the Council had 
already detemiined the names of a majority of the Sectional Presi- 
dents whom it was intended to appoint for the Australian Meeting; 
the names of certain other official and leading members of the ' Overseas 
Party ' (as it came to be termed) for that Meeting were already known, 
and the Committee was thus able to allocate some part of the grants 
forthwith. It then became essential that the Committee should be 
informed how far the demand for grants was likely to exceed the supply. 
In June 1913, thei-efore, members of the General Committee were asked 
whether they would join the invited party if grants were offered them ; !i 
selection was found to be necessary from the list of names thus 
obtained, and this task occupied the Committee during the ensuing 
autumn, from the time of the Birmingham Meeting onward, while 
later on it became possible to draw upon outstanding names in order 
to fill vacancies which from time to time, through various individual 
causes, occurred in the ' grantee ' list. No grant was left unfilled. 

Foreign and Dominions Bepresentatives.— Before leaving the 
subject of the selection of the invited Members, reference may be made 
to tlie invitation of repi'esentatiyes from foreign countries, the United 
States of America, and British overseas Dominions other than Australia. 
It was the wish of the Australian authorities (as appears from the cable- 
gram quoted above) that the Overseas Party should include such repre- 
sentatives; the list of Members of the Association (especially that of 
Honorary Corresponding Members) supphed in itself a wide field for 
invitation; in addition, other names were suggested by the executives in 
the various States of the Commonwealth, and others, again, by the 
representatives of llie \ai-ious Sections of the Association on tlie Com- 
mittee at home. It will be readily understood that the number of 



OF THR AUSTRALIAN MEETING. 685 

invitations issued to foreign representatives was large in proportion to 
the number of those who were able to accept, but eventually the Over- 
seas Party included altogether 1 Canadian, 10 American, 3 South 
African, 8 German, 1 Russian, 1 Polish, 2 Italian, 1 Swedish, and 
5 Danish members and guests, and also 3 from British India. 

Number of the Overseas Party. — Apart from the allocation of grants, 
the question of the total number of the Overseas Party demanded careful 
consideration. The Council had not the power, even if it had felt the 
inclination, to impose any direct limitation upon the number of Members 
attending the Meeting. On the other hand, the Australian authorities, 
while offering very extensive facilities in the direction of free railway 
travelling and hospitality up to a number largely in excess of the number 
of the grantees and other Members specially invited, were obviously 
compelled to take into^ consideration the number for whom it would be 
possible to provide special trains and find hospitality. Moreover, it was 
essential that the number and composition of the Overseas Party should 
be known at as early a date as possible, in order that the local organisa- 
tion might be carried out with a reasonable knowledge of the require- 
ments of the party. A general circular concerning the Meeting was 
therefore issued to Members in October 1913 ; replies from those who 
intended to attend the Meeting were invited by November 1 (excepting 
the case of Members residing abroad), and it was made clear that any 
delay in replying might involve a Member in difficulties and incon- 
veniences for which no responsibility could be accepted. In December 
1913 the Council decided that Members whose intimations of intention 
to attend were qualified by doubt, or were received late, could be 
guaranteed no special facilities in Australia, and that no new Members 
should be enrolled for inclusion in the Overseas Party, except at the 
discretion of the Committee, as in the case of an applicant whose 
attendance might be deemed to be of special importance on scientific 
grounds. It remained open to Members to proceed to Australia, and 
take part in the Meeting, at their own risk so far as concerned the 
facilities already mentioned : a few did so. But the provisions above 
detailed succeeded in their object of ensuring that no serious difficulties 
should be ultimately encountered by the Australian authorities in dealing 
with the transport and accommodation of the party. No division of 
the party was made into ' official ' and ' non-official ' classes for purposes 
of differential treatment in these departments. The total number of 
the Overseas Party was 300. No Associates were enrolled in England 
for this Meeting. 

Arrangement of Sectional Programmes. — The Council held a special 
meeting on October 17, 1913, in order to appoint sectional officers, 
and thus enable the Organising Sectional Committees to get to work as 
early as possible. It was agreed that as it would be barely possible, 
in view of the great distance, for these Committees to receive and 
consider papers offered by Australian scientific workers, local com- 
mittees in Australia should undertake the responsibility of selecting 
these, working on the rough rule that local communications should not 
generally occupy more than one-third of the time available for sectional 
wox'k, though in such sections as Geology, Zoology, Geography, 



G86 NARRATIVE AND ITINERARY 

Anthropology, Botany, and Agriculture this proportion might be 
increased to one-half. 

Special Membership Terms in Australia. — At the same meeting of 
Council the General Treasurer brought forward proposals (which had 
been referred to the Council by the General Committee Meeting at 
Birmingham) regarding the cost of membership subscriptions for 
persons joining locally in Australia. These proposals, which were 
adopted, laid down that for persons attending meetings in any two 
or more centres the price of membership tickets should remain un- 
altered, but that for persons attending at any one centre only the price 
of nev/ annual membership should be £1 only, including the right to 
receive the annual volume free, and that there should be an Associate's 
fee of 10s., at Adelaide and Brisbane only. The main reason for these 
special arrangements lay in the fact that at no one centre in Australia 
would there be undertaken the equivalent of a complete programme of 
a meeting under normal conditions. Any ticket issued in Australia to 
a lady was made transferable to another lady under the same con- 
ditions as those under which it was issued. That these concessions 
were appreciated was proved by the very large local membership en- 
rolled, to which reference is made later in this narrative. 

Visit of the Australian General Organising Secretary to England. — 

During the period from July to December 1913, during which the 
majority of the ai'rangements hitherto discussed were undertaken, the 
home officers and Council had the benefit of the presence and collabora- 
tion of the Australian Organising Secretary, Dr. A. C. D. Eivett, who 
was sent on a special mission to England in connection with the 
arrangements. During his visit he was able to attend the Meeting of the 
Association in Birmingham in September 1913, and thus to obtain a 
full knowledge of the details of organisation under normal conditions. 
He was also able to become personally acquainted with a large pro- 
portion of the intending visitors to Australia. For the rest, he worked 
in intimate relationship with the Assistant Secretary at the London 
Office, and together they traversed, so far as possible, the whole field 
of the organisation, with the guidance and approval of the General 
Officers, the Committee, and the Council. The sum of their dis- 
cussions was finally embodied in a memorandum, dealing in detail with 
such topics as the arrangements to be made for the reception of the 
jiarty on arrival at each centre, with the character and method of 
distributing to each member information lists advising of these arrange- 
ments and directions as to transport, with the handling of baggage, 
and in connection with this, and for other purposes, the allocation of a 
distinguishing number to each individual member of the Overseas Party, 
with the fitting and organisation of service in the Reception Rooms, 
with the requirements of the Sections, with the division of work between 
the London and the local offices in regard to the issue of tickets, pro- 
grammes and other matter, and so forth. They also endeavoured to 
define the various topics on which they would have to exchange in- 
formation by mail during the period January to June 1914 (i.e., after 
Dr. Rivett's return to Australia), and in some instances the particular 



OP THE AUSTRALIAN MEETING. 687 

mails by which such information should be sent were specified. These 
plans, tentative as they were, succeeded so far that the use of the 
cables was necessitated only six times from London to Australia and 
five times in the opposite direction during the period named. 

At the last meeting of Council before Dr. Eivett's departure from 
London (December 5, 1913), it was resolved that the thanks of the 
Council be expressed to him for the assistance he had rendered in 
connection witli the arrangements for the Australian Meeting during 
his visit to England, and to the authorities in Australia under whose 
direction he had paid this visit. 

The Assistant Secretary left London early in June 1914 to join the 
General Organising Secretary in Australia, when they visited together 
all the centres (except Perth) before the beginning of the Meeting, 
as Dr. Eivett had already done on previous occasions. 

Shipping Arrangements. — In the meantime the work of the officers 
at home was concerned mainly with making up the Overseas Party 
(as has been shown already), and those sections of it which were to 
visit Western Australia in advance of the main body, and New Zealand 
after the conclusion of the Meeting in Sydney.-^ With the exception of 
the arrangement with the Orient Company, which was originally made 
by the Australian authorities, negotiations with the shipping companies 
as to special fares and arrangements for Overseas Members had been 
conducted, and continued to be so, principally from the London Office, 
and may be briefly summarised here : — - 

(1) Via Suez, return, 1st class £100 (refund £35 if return half of 
ticket unused). Second class £65. Orient and P. &amp; O. lines (return 
tickets interchangeable between these) ; also Norddeutscher Lloyd line. 

(2) Via Suez outward; return via Malay Archipelago to Colombo 
and Suez, 1st class £130. Burns, Philp and other lines locally through 
Archipelago. 

(3) Eound the world via Atlantic, Vancouver, or San Francisco, and 
Suez, £120; or via South Africa instead of Suez, £100. All traus- 
Atlantic hues; Canadian Pacific, Union Steamship Co. of New Zealand, 
and Oceanic trans-Pacific services. 

(4) North American routes, return, 1st class £115 10s. 

' Projected Visit to New Zealand. — An invitation was received in 1911 
from the High Commissioner for New Zealand, on behalf of his Government, for 
some of the Members visiting Australia to proceed to the Dominion, and it was 
subsequently arranged, after consultation with the Australian authorities, that 
a party should leave the Meeting of the Association at the conclusion of the 
Sydney session, and proceed to New Zealand to take part in scientific meetings, 
excursions, &amp;c., together with representative Canadian and American men of 
science invited by the Dominion authorities. A committee under the chairman- 
ship of the High Commissioner, and including representatives of the Association, 
selected in London a number of Members for invitation, and to receive grants in 
aid of additional expenses incurred by the visit out of a fund provided by the 
Dominion Government, while Professor T. H. Laby (of Victoria College, 
Wellington) and others concerned themselves with arrangements in New 
Zealand. But while the Meeting of the Association was in progress it was 
announced that the an-angements for the visit to New Zealand had unhappily 
proved in great measure abortive, owing to the effects of the European War.

(5) Vid South Africa, return, ist class ii75. Blue Fuuuel and 
Aberdeen lines. 

Various alternative routes were offered by the above and other 
companies : it is unnecessary to detail them here, but it may be stated 
that the companies generally met the requirements of the party very 
liberally. The vessels and routes which carried the largest numbers 
of Members on the outward journey were — (1) the Orient E.M.S. 
Orvieio, sailing from London on July 3 vid Suez and arriving in 
Adelaide on August 8, which also, by special arrangement with the 
Company, carried most of the Western Australian advance party for- 
ward from Fremantle to Adelaide; (2) the Blue Funnel s.s. Ascanius, 
which, by special arrangement, sailed from Liverpool on June 22, via 
Cape Town, and called at Fremantle on July 28, conveying the majority 
of the Western Australian advance party; (3) the Aberdeen s.s. Euri- 
pides, which (making her maiden voyage) left London on July 1 and 
called by special arrangement at x\delaide on August 7. Some Members 
reached Australia by way of the Pacific and Sydney, and some made 
extended stays in Western Australia or elsewhere, in advance of the 
Meeting, for purposes of research. 

Communications to Members. — As Members of the Overseas Party 
were thus able to pursue their individual inclinations as to routes 
for the outward voyage, and as it was essential to the organisation 
that each Member's route and date of arrival should be known, it 
was necessary, during the early months of 1914, for the Loudon Office 
to request (if not to importune) the Members to state their inten- 
tions. For the most part Members appreciated this necessity, and 
only in isolated instances were the organisers at home and in Australia 
compelled to make arrangements in ignorance of the actual intentions 
of Members who failed to realise the inconvenience which they caused 
by refraining from answering inquiries, or even neglecting to give infor- 
mation that their intention to attend had been cancelled. In addition 
to such inquiries it was necessary to furnish all or some of the Members, 
during the period November 1913 — June 1914, with vouchers forreduced 
steamship fares, information concerning the visits to Western Australia, 
Tasmania, and Broken Hill, and the projected visit to New Zealand, 
invitations to join these parties, information concerning arrangements 
with shipping companies, scientific investigations to be made during 
the voyage, &amp;c., and, at a late stage, progi'ammes of final general 
arrangements, and of sectional arrangements, together with a list of 
the Overseas Party and the route adopted by each Member so far as 
known, with which was incorporated a dated memorandum book cover- 
ing the period of the stay in Australia. Membership tickets and special 
luggage labels (bearing the Members' distinguishing numbers) were also 
issued from the London Office. Taking all these matters into considera- 
tion, it is not impossible that some Members may have received during 
this period as many as twenty-eight printed programmes or other circular 
communications, in addition to individual correspondence with the office, 
which attained (in some instances) substantial dimensions. Indeed, the 
total number of programmes, circulars, letters, &amp;c., issued from and 

1914. Y T 



090 NARRATIVE AND ITINERARY 

received by the London Office in connection with the Australian Meeting 
is estimated to have exceeded 24,000, and in this connection it is neces- 
sary to remember that the London Office was only one of a number of 
centres where official business connected with the Meeting was regu- 
larly carried on. Some account of the work in these other (Australian) 
centres may now be given. 

Australian Organisation, 1914. 

On the return of the Organising Secretary from England in February 
1914 an office was established in the Prime Minister's Department, 
Melbourne, which served to keep the work done in each capital city in 
touch with that of the London office. Periodical A'isits were made to 
the other States by the Organising Secretary. 

Copies of the memorandum prepared in London by the Assistant 
Secretary and the Australian Organising Secretary were circulated to 
the responsible officers in each centre. Specific local conditions some- 
times necessitated trifling alterations in the suggested scheme of 
organisation, but for the most part the general plan was closely adhered 
to, it being recognised fully by all executive ofiicers that the advantage 
of uniformity was very great, and would be particularly appreciated by 
Overseas Members when moving rapidly from one capital to another. 

Executive Committees, together with sub-committees dealing with 
hospitality, excursions, and scientific business, met frequently after the 
beginning of April. The main work of the Hospitality Committees, after 
securing hosts, lay in the allocation of guests to hosts. As the time 
of the Meeting approached it was, of course, inevitable that many 
changes would occur in the list of visiting Members : the consequent 
continuous readjustments in hospitality arrangements were sometimes 
considerable. As will be seen later, this was particularly the case in 
Brisbane, where the abandonment at the last moment of the Meeting 
in New Zealand necessitated a rapid alteration of most of the 
Committee's arrangements. 

The Excursions Committees, after settling the localities to be visited, 
were requii-ed to determine the numbers of overseas and local Members 
respectively, for whom provision could be made. The general prin- 
ciple was accepted throughout that the excursions were primarily, and 
in many cases solely, for the visitors. Thanks to the keenness of the 
Members of the Overseas Party there were scarcely any cases of 
arrangements failing through lack of visitors. Very great assistance 
was rendered by Government officials throughout the work of all 
Excursions Committees. 

In each centre reports on the work of executive and sub-committees 
were presented periodically to the large General Committees. 

Local Membership.— It was fully recognised in Australia that the 
possibility of the Association continuing during 1914-1915 its work of 
financially aiding original scientific investigations depended largely upon 
securing a long roll of local Members. This fact was made widely 
known in the Press, and the determination was expressed that the 
visit to Australia should not result in any lessening of the Association's 
activities. Even better results would have attended efforts to gain local

Members had there not been a temporary cessation of enrolments 
directly after the outbreak of war. 

The Meeting in Australia. 
Western Australia. 

Outward Voyages of Advance Party.— About seventy visiting 
Members, who became known collectively as the Advance Party, visited 
Western Australia for a stay in most cases of a week, but in some 
of a fortnight or even longer, before the main party arrived in Aus- 
tralia. Of those who stayed a week most arrived by the Blue Funnel 
steamer Ascanius, which made a special call at Fremantle (the port of 
Perth, W.A.) in order to land the party. A few arrived by the P. &amp; O. 
mail steamer {via Suez), which reached Fremantle on July 28, the 
same date as the Ascanius. 

A good deal of research definitely planned in relation to the Australian 
Meeting was carried on during the voyage out by some members of 
the Advance Party. On the Ascanius, for example, Professor W. G. 
Duffield made observations on the variations in the force of gravity over 
the ocean, and Professor W. A. Herdman examined and preserved 
samples of the plankton from the surface waters running continuously 
through fine silk nets, day and night, between Liverpool and Fremantle. 
Both these researches were very materially promoted by the managers 
of the Blue Funnel Line, who most generously fitted up a special 
laboratory for each of these purposes and gave special facilities for 
carrying on the work. Eesearch was also carried out on other routes, 
and on the return voyages. 

Public Lectures, &amp;c., in Western Australia. — Some little delay in 
the arrival of the Ascanius on July 28 interfered in some measure with 
the arrangements for that day, but that evening Professor W. A. Herd- 
man, F.R.S., was able to give the first Association lecture in the Museum 
Lecture Hall at Perth, with His Excellency the Governor of Western 
Austraha, Sir Harry Barron in the chair, the subject being ' Why We 
Investigate the Ocean.' After expressing the gratitude of the visitors 
for their reception in Western Australia and their appreciation of the 
labour which had been expended throughout the centres to be visited, in 
preparation for the Meeting, Professor Herdman approached the subject- 
matter of his lecture principally from the point of view of the establish- 
ment and development of marine fisheries, with especial reference to the 
potentialities of Australian waters. He also discussed the investigation, 
exploitation, and regulation of the fisheries of North-western Europe, 
illustrating by means of lantern slides the methods there employed, while 
another series of slides illustrated the reproduction and growth of the 
more valuable fishes found in British waters, and their dependence upon 
the more minute organisms forming the plankton of the ocean. 

Subsequently official lectures were given in Perth as follows: — 

July 31, at the Museum, Professor A. S. Eddington, F.R.S., on 
' Stars and Their Movements,' the Lieutenant-Governor, Sir Edward 
Stone, in the chair. The lecturer discussed the census of stars and their 
classification according to age by means of their spectra, of which

examples were shown on the screen. The doubhng and the weight of 
stars, the movements of the stellar system and its probable shape were 
among other branches of the subject dealt with. 

August 2, at the Literary Institute, Mr. H. Balfour on ' Primitive 
Methods of Making Fire, and their Survival for Ceremonial Purposes.' 
The first part of the lecture described the various methods whereby fire 
is obtained by friction of wood among primitive peoples in various parts 
of the world, and touched upon their possible origin and geographical 
dispersal. The second part was devoted to the consideration of the 
ceremonial retention of such primitive and obsolete methods by peoples 
of more advanced culture, among whom the earlier processes have, for 
ordinary domestic purposes, been superseded by improved appliances, 
such as the flint and steel or the lucifer match. The production of 
' pure-fire ' for use in religious ritual, ' need-fire ' for averting epidemics 
and other calamities, and ' new-fire ' as a means of promoting the 
welfare of crops, &amp;c., afford very numerous and widely dispersed 
instances of the persistence in ceremonial fire-making of otherwise 
obsolete methods, and this aspect of the subject formed the main theme 
of the lecture, which was illustrated throughout with lantern-slides. 

August 3, at the Museum, Professor A. D. Waller, F.R.S., on ' The 
Electrical Action of the Human Heart. ' He gave a popular history of 
the electro-cardiogram, describing how it occurred to him in 1887 to 
use the limbs as electrodes leading off on opposite sides of the electrical 
equator of the heart from his right hand and left foot to a Lippmann 
electrometer, and watching the mercury column pulsate with his heart- 
beat; extending these investigations by means of Einthoven's string 
galvanometer he devised a simple formula for calculating the axial angle 
of the heart which is of physiological importance. 

A lecture was also delivered in the Town Hall, Kalgoorlie, on 
July 31, by Mr. 0. A. Buckmaster (lately an Assistant Secretary of the 
Board of Education) on ' Mining Education in England. ' The lecturer 
gave an account of the efforts that have been made in England to provide 
instruction in relation to metalliferous mining for day and for evening 
students. Special reference was made to the founding and progress of 
the Eoyal School of Mines, of the School of Metalliferous Mining 
(Cornwall), and of the characteristics of these schools. Attention was 
also drawn to the value the English experiments would possess in the 
development of technical instruction in mining in Australia. 

Various other lectures and speeches, of an unofficial character so far 
as concerned the Association, were delivered by Members, here as 
elsewhere, throughout the Meeting. 

On the evening of July 29 the first graduation ceremony held by the 
University of Western Australia took place in the ballroom at Govern- 
ment House, His Excellency the Governor presiding. The Meeting 
was addressed by Mr. Cecil Andrews, Pro-Chancellor, and honorary 
degrees were conferred on the following members of the Overseas 
Party: — Prof. Gunnar Andersson, Prof. W. Bateson,* Dr. F. W. 
Dyson, Dr. A. C. Haddon, Prof. W. A. Herdman,* Sir H. Reichel, 
Prof. A. D. Waller, Prof. J. Walther.* 

(* In absentid.) 



694 NARRATIVE AND ITINERARY 

Sir Winthrop Hackett, K.C.M.G., first Chancellor of the University 
and senior member of the Legislative Council, was similarly honoured 
in absentid, and a number of other degrees were also conferred. Dr. 
A. C. Haddon addressed the Meeting on behalf of the Association. 

Field-work in Western Australia. —The principal object of the visit 
to Western Australia, however, was to carry out work in the field, 
mainly in the directions of botany, geology, zoology, and agricultural 
investigation. A number of official excursions had been arranged to this 
end, and among the localities and places visited by parties of the visitors 
were the Irwin country, the Darling Eange (Kalamunda, Lesmurdie, 
Cannington, &amp;c.) ; Mogumber, New Norcia (where Members were re- 
ceived at the Benedictine Monastery), and Gillingarra; Albany and its 
neighbourhood ; Mount Barker, the Stirling Range, and Northam ; 
Busselton and the Yallingup and Margaret Eiver caves ; Mundaring 
Weir ; Kalgoorlie ; and the Big Brook timber mills in the j arrah and 
karri forests, and Bridgetown. Informal visits were also made to points 
in the Darling Range and elsewhere in the neighbourhood of Perth. 

Of scarcely less interest to zoologists and anthropologists were the 
discussions which resulted from visits to the collections at the Museum 
(under the direction of Messrs. Woolnough and Alexander), and 
to those at the University made by Professor W. J. Dakin from 
the AbrolhO'S Islands (the subject of a communication to Section D at 
Sydney). Throughout the visit to Western Australia, although no 
formal sectional meetings were held, the public lectures were well 
attended, and the conferences with local men of science dealt largely 
with questions of local research, and may confidently be expected to 
result in the advancement of Science. 

The great majority of the Advance Party joined the Orient E.M.S. 
Orvieto at Fremantle, and sailed for Adelaide on August 4. 

Adelaide, August 8-12. 

Arrival at Adelaide : Railway Passes. — Apai-t from some individual 
]\Iembers who had arrived at earlier dates, the first party to arrive at 
Adelaide was that on board the Aberdeen s.s. Euripides, which berthed 
at the Outer Harbour on August 7 — the day previous to that on which 
she was originally expected. The large party (some 140) on the R.M.S. 
Orvieto followed on the morning of August 8. Both steamers were met 
by some of the principal officers for the Meeting, and Members before 
leaving the vessels were supplied with railway passes, which, by the 
combined action and generosity of the Railway Commissioners in all the 
States, enabled the whole of the Overseas Party to travel without charge 
over Government railways throughout the Commonwealth, the passes 
being valid from August 4 to September 18, and including sleeping 
berths. 

Information Lists : Conveyance from Stations, &amp;c.— In the case of 
each of the -parties landing from the steamers, compartments were 
reserved on one of the special trains running, in connection with the 
steamers, from the Outer Harbour to Adelaide. Each Member had

Address 



On the arrival of each party at Adelaide Station, cabs and motor- 
cars, each bearing a distinguishing number, were in waiting, and 
Members, being able to identify their conveyances from the numbers 
in the Information List (and with the assistance of local officers who 
were in attendance), were expeditiously conveyed to the addresses where 
accommodation had been arranged for them. Their baggage (except- 
ing hand-baggage) was dealt with, here and elsewhere, independently. 
Contracts had been made with a firm of carriers in each centre to 
collect and distribute baggage. The special luggage-labels bore the 
Members' distinguishing numbers in large figures, in order that the 
carriers might be able readily to sort the baggage. 

The same method of distributing both Members and their baggage 
on arrival at each centre was relied upon throughout. 

The Eeception Eoom (Elder Hail) and Association Offices at Ade- 
laide were established in the University. 

The Meeting and the War. — It was known, not only in Australia 
but also to the Members arriving at this date, that the British Empire 
had become involved in war. The majority of Members of the Council 
present in Adelaide therefore immediately met (on the afternoon of 
August 8) in order to assure the Australian authorities of their acquies- 
cence, on behalf of the Overseas Party, in any modification of the 
programme which might be found desirable in these unhappy circum- 
stances. Professors Orme Masson, T. W. Edgewoiih David, and E. C. 
Stirling were present, and, as official representatives of the Federal 
Council and the Local Executives, expressed appreciation of the 
thoughtfulness which prompted this assurance, but felt strongly that 
the scientific and other business of the Meeting should proceed, even 
if it were necessary to modify some of the social functions. A telegi'am 
received by the President while this discussion was in progress, from 
His Excellency the Governor-General, Sir E. Munro-Ferguson, sup- 
ported these views : — 

. ' I heartily welcome you and the Members of the British Asso- 
ciation to Australia. "Wish your arrival could have taken place in 
a less anxious time, but trust that, in spite of the grave pre-occupa- 
tion of the moment, your visit may be a happy one and fruitful in 
good results.' 

It may be stated here that this wish, so far as concerned the 
visiting pai'ty, was amply fulfilled. Modifications consequent upon the 
international situation were practically negligible, so- far as concerned 
the Australian programme, although, as will be seen later, the plans 
for the homeward journeys of many of the Members had to be changed.

OF THE AUSTRALIAN MEETING. 697 

Australian pivblic men and private citizens did not allow * the grave 
pre-occupation of the moment ' to interfere in any perceptible measure 
with their interest in the proceedings of the Meeting, and the hospitality 
and community of sentiment which were everywhere encountered by 
the visitors were possibly enhanced, certainly undiminished, by the 
stress of these external circumstances. 

The position of some of the foreign guests among the Overseas 
Party gave rise to anxious consideration, but it may be recorded here 
that all were enabled to participate in the Meeting. 

Saturday, August 8. — In the afternoon (in addition to the meeting 
mentioned above) a graduation ceremony was held in the Town Hall, 
when honorary degrees were conferred upon the following Overseas 
Mem.bers: — Prof. T. Hudson Beare, Prof. E. W. Brown, Prof. A. P. 
Coleman, Mr. A. D. Hall, Prof. G. W. O. Howe, Prof. H. Jungersen, 
Dr. C. F. Juritz, Sir Oliver Lodge, Sir Charles P. Lucas, Prof. 
P. von Luschan, Prof. A. Penck, Prof. Elliot Smith, Prof. W. J. 
Sollas. A degree was also conferred upon Prof. T. W. Edgeworth 
David (Sydney). Prof. E. C. Stirling welcomed the visitors, and Sir 
Oliver Lodge, in replying, read the telegram from the Governor-General 
quoted above. 

Motor-cars, generously provided by the Local Executive and private 
residents, conveyed many Members (on this and the following days) 
for drives through the city, into the hills (Mount Lofty, &amp;c.), and 
to other points of interest in the locality. In the afternoon a party 
of geologists and chemists left for a visit to Port Pirie and Broken 
Hill, which occupied most of them till the following Tuesday. 

At 8.30 P.M. a Eeception was held in the Town Hall by the 
Government of South Australia. Speeches of welcome were delivered 
by His Excellency the State Governor, Sir H. Galway, K.C.M.G., 
and by the Hon. A. H. Peake, State Premier; and Sir Oliver Lodge, 
F.E.S., President of the Association, replied. 

Sunday, A^igust 9. — No official engagements were arranged. A 
special afternoon service took place in St. Peter's Cathedral. 

The Adelaide Municipal Tramways Trust despatched special cars, 
and, as already indicated, private motor-cars were also available for 
the purpose of informal excursions in the neighbourhood of the city. 

At 8.15 P.M. Professor E. 0. K. Conner delivered a Citizens' 
Lecture in the Town Hall on ' Saving and Spending,' under the 
auspices of the South Australian branch of the Workers' Educa- 
tional Association. The lecture dealt with the processes involved in 
saving and spending, and their ultimate effects upon the community, 
with particular reference to the ways in which and the objects for 
which people save. The chair was taken by Mr. T. Eyan, President 
of the Branch, and the lecture was followed by speeches from Sir 
Oliver Lodge and Professor W. Bateson. 

Monday, August 10, was devoted to excursions. It may be stated 
in regard to excursions generally, not only from Adelaide but elsewhere, 
that they were arranged primarily with an eye to the scientific interests ^ 

' The excursions are briefly summarised in the following diary : a dis- 
cussion of the special scientific interests of some of them will be found in 
later pages. 



698 NARRATIVE AND ITINERARY 

of the visiting Members, and did not afford opportunity for any large 
proportion of the local Members to take part in them. Eecognising 
this generous attitude on the part of the local organisers and Members, 
the General Secretaries of the Association addressed a circular letter 
to Members of the Overseas Party in Adelaide, inviting them to take 
advantage to the utmost of the official excursion arrangements. 

A general all-day excursion took place to Angaston and district. 
Luncheon was provided by Mr. Charles Angas in the Agi'icultural Hall 
at Angaston. Mr. Glynn, Commonwealth Minister of External Affairs, 
proposed the toast of the visitors, and Sir Oliver Lodge replied. Sir 
H. E. Eeichel proposed the health of Mr. and Mrs. Angas. Motor- 
cars were provided by residents to convey Members on short drives 
in the neighbourhood. A limited party visited the vineyards and 
cellars of Messrs. Seppelt, at Seppeltsfield, and lunched there. On 
the return journey the Chateau Tanunda Company's wine-cellars at 
Tanunda were inspected, and tea was provided by the Company. A 
botanical excursion by motor to the hills near Adelaide was conducted 
by Professor T. G. B. Osborn ; and Professor E. C. Stirling led an 
anthropological excursion to Milang, Lake Alexandi'ina, where a partj' 
of aborigines was seen. Mr. W. Howchin conducted a geological ex- 
cursion, lasting over August 10 and 11, by motor to the Sturt Eiver. 
Hallett's Cove, Inman Valley, and Sellicks' Hill, the party spending 
the night at Victor Harbour. 

In the evening of August 10 at 8.30, Sir Oliver J. Lodge, F.E.S., 
President, delivered a discourse on 'The Ether of Space.' His Excel- 
lency the Governor, Sir H. Galway, K.C.M.G., presided. The 
lecturer described the properties of the ether of space as the omni- 
present connecting medium, and maintained its complete reality, in 
spite of its intangible and generally insensible character. He dis- 
cussed the relation between ether and matter, and urged that the 
experimental elusiveness of the ether was a natural consequence of 
its uniformity and of the universality of its functions. A vote of 
thanks to the lecturer was proposed by Professor E. C. Stirling, 
C.M.G., F.E.S., and seconded by Professor T. W. Edgeworth David, 
C.M.G., F.E.S. 

Tuesday, August 11. — Further excursions took place: to Eose- 
worthy Agricultural College, under Mr. A. J. Perkins, Director of 
Agriculture; and to Mannum (a botanical excursion by motor, under 
Professor T G. B. Osborn), while opportunities were again provided 
to visit the hills by motor, luncheon and tea being kindly furnished 
at a number of private houses in the Mount Lofty district. 

A luncheon to some sixty visiting Members was given by the 
Commonwealth Club. Sir J. Downer was in the chair, and speeches 
were delivered by him and by Professor W. Bateson, Sir E. Schafer, 
Sir 0. P. Lucas, and Professor J. Perry. 

An Evening Discourse was given at 8 p.m. in the Town Hall by 
Professor W. J. Sollas, F.E.S. , on "Ancient Hunters," Sir Oliver 
Lodge presiding. The lecturer emphasised the results of recent re- 
search in dispelling exaggerated notions as to the antiquity of known 
remains of the human race, and discussed the correlation of the 



OF THE AUSTRALIAN MEETING.

1 ..lasolithic races of Europe with existing hunting tribes— e.gr., 
Austrahan, Bushman, Eskimo — and the early development and rapid 
progress of the human race in the arts. A vote of thanks was pro- 
posed by Dr. Verco, President of the Eoyal Society of South Australia, 
and seconded by Dr. A. C. Haddon, P.R.S. 

A telegram of welcome to the Association from Mr. Cook, Prime 
Minister of the Commonwealth, was read from the chair: ' Heartiest 
of welcomes to the British Association for the Advancement of Science, 
and warm felicitations on its first meeting in Australia. We are greatly 
honoured in having as our guests so many distinguished torch-bearers of 
truth, and from so many lands. May the light you bring continue to 
shine through the mists which momentarily have settled upon the 
world. ' 

The Eight Worshipful the Mayor of Adelaide, Mr. A. A. Simpson, 
lield a Reception (in lieu of the Ball which had been arranged) in the 
Exhibition Building. 

Wednesday, August 12. — Sectional Presidential Addresses were 
delivered in the Town Hall : — 

At 10 A.M. Sir Charles P. Lucas, K.C.B., K.C.M.G. (Section E, 
Geography). 

At 11.30 A.M. Mr. A. D. Hall, F.E.S. (Section M, Agriculture, 
Part I). 

Railway Arrangements. — The Overseas Party, accompanied (as it 
was throughout) by a few official and other inter- State Members, left 
Adelaide in the afternoon by three special trains at 2.37, 3.30, and 
6 P.M. Sleeping-berth accommodation was provided on this and all 
subsequent night- journeys for every Member, berths having been pre- 
viously allocated by the organisers, and the Members informed of their 
places by means of the Information Lists. The scheme of these lists 
was broadly the same throughout: thus the Melbourne Information 
List, distributed in Adelaide, contained the following particulars: —

respectively. 

The business of the Meeting was carried on for the most part in 
the University of Melbourne, the Reception Eoom being established 
in the Wilson Hall, while the Sectional Meetings were held in lecture 
theatres or other rooms, as follows: — 
Section 

A — Natural Philosophy Department.

Luncheon and tea were served in the Union Building, where smoking 
and ladies' rooms, &amp;c., were also provided. The Secretarium was 
established in the Grand Hotel, Spring Street. 

Members were requested to attend at the Reception Room during 
the afternoon, to make final arrangements with regard to excursions. 
A representative of the Melbourne Excursions Committee, however, 
had attended in the Reception Room at Adelaide, and thus many 
Members had been able to make their applications in advance : the 
same principle was adopted throughout, a Sydney representative attend- 
ing for this purpose at Melbourne, and a Brisbane representative at 
Sydney. 

The Council met at 4 p.m., and the General Committee at 4.30 p.m., 
in the Biological Department. 

In the afternoon a number of Members were entertained by an 
exhibition of boomerang-throwing given by Dr. Harvey Sutton and 
others. 

In the evening a Reception was given at Federal Government House 
by Their Excellencies the Governor-General and Lady Helen Munro- 
Ferguson. 

Friday, August 14. — In the morning the Sections met, and in five 
of them (Mathematics and Physics, Chemistry, Zoology, Economics, 
Physiology) presidential addresses were delivered. 

In the afternoon a graduation ceremony was held in the Melba Hall 
of the University at 2.15, when honorary degrees were conferred upon 
the following members: — Professor C. G. Abbot, Professor H. E. 
Armstrong, Professor W. Bateson, Professor W. M. Davis, Dr. F. W. 
Dyson, Sir Thomas H. Holland, Professor Luigi Luiggi, Professor 
W. J. Pope, Professor A. W. Porter, Sir Ernest Rutherford, Sir E. A. 
Schafer, Professor J. Walther. 

Later in the afternoon a Civic Reception was given in the Town 
Hall by the Lord Mayor (Mr. Hennessy) and citizens of Melbourne. 

At 8.30 P.M., in the Auditorium, the Presidency of the Association 
was assumed by Professor William Bateson, P.R.S., in succession to 
Sir Oliver Lodge, F.R.S., who introduced the new President. Professor 
Bateson delivered the first part of his address, and a vote of thanks was 
proposed by His Excellency the Governor- General (Sir R. Munro- 
Ferguson) and seconded by His Excellency the Governor of Victoria 
(Sir Arthur Stanley). 

SatuTday, August 15, was devoted to excursions, visits being paid 
to Ballarat, Bendigo, Bacchus Marsh, Marysville, Emerald, "Warburton,

National Park, the Macedon district, and Werribee. At Ballarat the 
party were the guests of the Mayor of the City, Mr. Brokenshire, and 
the Mayor of Ballarat East, Mr. Pittard. Some of tlie Members pro- 
ceeded to Creswick to inspect the Government plantations and nursery, 
and were the guests of the Minister of Forests at luncheon, the Premier, 
Sir A. Peacock, presiding in the unavoidable absence of the Minister. 
At Bendigo the Mayor, Mr. Andrew, and others received the party. 

The party visiting Bacchus Marsh alighted at Ballarat Plateau and 
descended to the Werribee Eiver, where the glaciated floor, conglo-

merate, &amp;c., were examined; the gorge was then ascended and the 
Ordovician dykes, glacials, &amp;c., were inspected. The party then 
drove to Bacchus Marsh. 

The Marysville excursion lasted from Saturday to Monday, and 
included a journey by motor through Lilydale, up the Valley of the 
Yarra, to Healesville and the adjacent elevated district, with its forest 
of giant eucalyptus; on the road thence to Marysville the Blacks' 
Spur was crossed at a height of about 1,800 feet. 



702 NARRATIVE AND ITINERARY 

The Emerald excursion included a visit to Femtree Gully, and 
took the visitors over the interesting narrow-gauge railway through 
the hilly bush country by Belgrave and Paradise. At Warburton and 
Cement Creek also pine forests and tree-fern gullies were seen, and the 
visitors were entertained by Mr. Jas. Cuming, who afforded them 
opportunity to inspect the saw-milling and allied industries in operation 
near Warburton. 

The National Park excursion lasted from Friday night till Monday, 
the varied flora of the park and the granite and other geological features 
of Wilson's Promontory and the adjacent mainland being inspected. 
It had been intended to I'each the promontory by a Government 
steamer, but as this was required for other purposes the journey was 
made overland, and involved riding over a considerable distance. 

The excursion to the Macedon district introduced visitors to an 
area of gi'eat geological interest, on account especially of the newer 
basalt plains of Keilor and the trachytic and other volcanic features in 
the vicinity of Macedon. 

At Werribee (an excursion primarily of agricultural interest) the 
Central Eesearch Farm was inspected, and the Members were addressed 
by Mr. Hutchinson, Minister of Agriculture, and Dr. S. S. Cameron, 
Director of Agriculture. 

At 8 p.m. Dr. W. Eosenhain, F.R.S., delivered a Citizens' Lecture 
in the Town Hall on ' The Making of a Big Gun, ' the Lord Mayor of 
Melbourne presiding. 

Sunday, August 16. — No official arrangements were made for this 
day. A considerable number of Members were away on extended 
excursions. Special services took place, or special sermons were 
delivered, in several of the principal churches in Melbourne. 

Monday, A^lgust 17. — Some sectional work occupied the forenoon. 

At 4 P.M. Professor E. B. Poulton, F.R.S., delivered in the 
Auditorium a Discourse on ' Mimicry. ' The lecturer dealt with cryptic 
resemblance, or that form of mimicry the purpose of which is conceal- 
ment, with the sematic or advertising uses of colour, and with other 
forms of imitation, illustrating his. remarks by examples from animal, 
fish, insect, and plant life, and then went on to consider those forms of 
true mimicry where a harmless insect is protected by the resemblance 
it has acquired to some other form having distasteful qualities. The 
President presided, and a vote of thanks was proposed by Professor 
W. Baldwin Spencer, C.M.G., F.R.S., and seconded by Professor 
A. Dendy, F.R.S. 

In the evening a Eeception was given by the Government of Victoria 
in the Public Library, National Gallery, and Museums. The Premier 
and Lady Peacock, the President and Mrs. Bateson, the President of 
the Legislative Council (Mr. J. M. Davies), Dr. and Mrs. Leeper, and 
the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly (Sir F. Madden) received 
guests in the Stawell Gallery. 

Tuesday, August 18. — The Sections continued their work this 
morning, and some carried their sessions on into the afternoon. 

In the afternoon a Eeception was given by members of local 
scientific societies in the Botanical Gardens. 



OF THE AUSTRALIAN MEETING. 703 

The Lord Mayor of Melbourne (Mr. Hennessy), President of the 
Overseas Club, and other members of its Council, waited upon 
Professor Bateson at Federal Government House in order to presen* 
him as President of the Association with an address of welcome from 
the Club. 

At 8.30 P.M., in the Auditorium, Dr. F. W. Dyson, F.E.S., 
Astronomer Koyal, delivered a Discourse on ' Greenwich Observatory.' 
He discussed the history of the Observatory, its work, and the labours 
of some of his predecessors in office; a number of astronomical photo- 
graphs were shown and explained. A vote of thanks was proposed, by 
Professor Orme Masson, F.E.S., and seconded by Mr. P. Baracchi, 
Government Astronomer. 

At 8 P.M., in the Town HaU, Professor H. B. Dixon, F.R.S., 
delivered a Citizens' Lecture on' Explosions,' His Excellency the State 
Governor presiding. 

Wednesday, Ati.gust 19. — Sectional work was continued in the 
morning, but the time available was limited by the hour fixed for the 
departure of the party from Melbourne for Sydney. 

Railway Arrangements. — The departure took place at 2.15 p.m. A 
very heavy train of the finest rolhng stock, including observation and 
dining cars and drawn by two locomotives, conveyed the party as far 
as Albury, where a break of gauge occurs between the railways of 
Victoria (5 ft. 3 in.) and of New South Wales (4 ft. 8* in.). The 
Members were the guests of the Victorian Railway Commissioners 
at afternoon tea and dinner on this train. 

At Albury Members were transferred to three special sleeping-car 
trains. 

Changes in Homeward Steamship Sailings. — It had become known 
by this time that the three ships by wliich the majority of the 
Members had travelled out (the Orvieto, Ascaiiius, and Eurifides), and 
by which many intended to return, had been requisitioned, among 
others, for Government purposes (conveyance of troops, &amp;c.) in con- 
nection with the war. Mr. Atlee Hunt, of the Commonwealth 
Department of External Affairs, and the representatives of the ship- 
ping companies concerned, gave the executive officers of the Associa- 
tion every help in ensuring that definite information in this matter 
should be furnished to Overseas Members as soon as available. The 
official arrangements for the visit of a party of Members to New 
Zealand had been cancelled (as narrated elsewhere). It therefore 
became necessary to the organisation that a further inquiry should be 
made of Members as to any change in their plans regarding their stay 
in and departure from Australia. This inquiry was made by means of 
a printed form distributed in the train between Melbourne and Albury. 

Overseas Members' Contribution to Australian Patriotic Funds. — 

It had also been decided, at a meeting of the General Officers on 
August 15, that Members in the Overseas Party should be given an 
opportunity of subscribing to one of the Patriotic Funds then being 
raised in Australia, and in this connection also advantage was taken 
of the gathering together in one train of practically the whole party to

make tiiis proposal known and begin the collection. The total sum 
ultimately collected, and forwarded to His Excellency the Governor- 
General after the close of the Meeting, amounted to 614/. 8s.* 

Sydney, August 20-26. 

Thursday, August 20. — The special trains arrived at Sydney between 
9 and 10 a.m. In the morning and afternoon Members visited the 
Reception Eoom. As at other centres, all the business of the Associa- 
tion, except evening lectures, was carried on at the University. The 
Great Hall served as the Eeception Eoom. The Sections made use of 
lecture theatres or other halls as follows : — 

Section 

A — Physics Department. 

B — Chemistry Department. 

C — Geology Department. 

D — Zoology Department. 

E — Pathology Theatre. 

F — Surgical Theatre. 

G — Engineering Building. 

H— Anatomy Theatre. 

I — Physiology Lecture Eoom. 

K — Latin Lecture Eoom. 

L — Mathematics Lecture Eoom. 

M — Veterinary Science Lecture Eoom. 

For certain joint and other meetings the Union Hall was used. 

2 The following letter of acknowledgment was received from His Excellency 
the Governor-General : — 

9th September, 1914. 

UeAE PrOFESSOE BAlTi.SOX, — 

I have to-day received your letter dated the 6th instant, and accompanying 
which is a cheque for 611?. 6s., t representing the combined contributions by the 
Members of the Overseas Visiting Party of the British Association to the 
Patriotic Fund now being raised in Australia. 

I need hardly assure you that this most kind and generous contribution 
by the visiting Members of the Association wiU be most deeply and warmly 
appreciated by all sections of the people of Australia, not so much because 
it represents a very substantial addition to the Fund referred to, but rather 
on account of the community of spirit and of sympathy it indicates. 

In view of the fact that each State in the Commonwealth has a distinct 
Patriotic Fund of its own, it has been decided, after careful consideration, 
that the fairest and most satisfactory method for the distribution of the 
sum that has been forwarded will be to divide it equally amongst the various 
States, a decision which, it is hoped, will meet with the approval of those 
who have so liberally contributed to the relief of Australian fellow-countrymen. 
1 am accordingly despatching ICOl. to the Executive Authority administering 
the Patriotic Fund in each capital, together with a copy of your letter and of 
the list of names of subscribers. 

I am, 

Yours very sincerely, 

(Signed) R. M. Ferguson. 

The President, 

Jiritish Association for the Advancement of Science. 

[+ The balance was forwarded later.] 



OF THE AUSTRALIAN MEETmG. 705 

Smoking and refreshment rooms were established in the University

and seconded by Sir E. A. Scliiifer, ex-President. 

Friday, August 21. — The Sections began their sessions in Sydney, 
Presidential Addresses being delivered in those of Geology, Engineering, 
Anthropology, Botany, and Education. 

At 1 P.M. a luncheon was given at the Town Hall to the Overseas 
]\Iembers and others by the State Government. The toast of ' The 
British Association ' was proposed by the Premier, Mr. Holman. Pro- 
fessor Bateson replied, and Sir Oliver Lodge proposed the toast of 
'The Government and jMinistry of New South Wales.' 

Later in the afternoon His Excellency the Governor of New South 
Wales, Sir Gerald Strickland, G.C.M.G., gave a Garden Party at 
" Cranbrook,' Eose Bay. 

At 8.30 P.M., in the Town Hall, Professor G. Elliot Smith, F.E.S., 
delivered a Discourse on ' Primitive Man. ' The President presided. 
The lecturer discussed in some detail the remains of primitive man of 
the Pleistocene and later periods, referring especially to the supposed 
Pleistocene skidl the discovery of which in the Darling Downs had 
been described earlier in the day in the Anthropological 'Section. He 
discussed and illustrated the evolution of mankind, and the links con- 
necting the brain of man with those of lower animals. A vote of 
thanks was proposed by Sir Everard im Thurn, Iv.C.M.G., and 
seconded by Sir T. Anderson Stuart. 

Saturday, August 22, was devoted to excursions. 

A party leaving Sydney on Friday night, and returning on Sunday 
evening, visited the Federal Territory, Canberra (the site of the Federal 
capital), and the Burrinjuck Dam. Other places and districts of interest 
which were visited by Overseas Members were — Coonamble and Wal- 
gett (for the Western plains, the wheat belt, and the pastoral industry) ; 
the Jenolan Caves and the fine limestone ravine scenery of the Blue 
Mountains at Wentworth Falls, Katoomba and Blackheath; Narramine 
(where arborglyphs were inspected) ; the Murrumbidgee irrigation area 
at Yanco; the Hawkesbury Agricultural College; the Hawkesbury 
Eiver and Newport districts; the National Park and Port Hacking; 
Bulh and the Cataract Dam ; and the electrolytic works at Port Kembla ' 
A geological excursion visited West Maitland and the lower Hunter 
district and coal-field. 

Further references to the excursions from Sydney will be found 
among the notes on scientific work which follow this narrative. 

At 8 P.M., in the Town Hall, Professor Benjamin Moore, FES 
delivered a Citizens' Lecture on ' Brown Earth and Bright s'un.shine'' 
the Lord Mayor presiding. Here, as elsewhere, the arrangements we-e

undertaken by the Workers' Educational Association. The lecturer 
dealt with the process of evolution from inorganic bodies. He showed 
that under the influence of bright sunshine the brown colouring matter 
(iron oxides) of the earth was capable of stirring up energy and forming 
organic compounds which then served as a substratum for the evolu- 
tion of the simplest living organisms. 

Sunday, August 23. — No ofiticial engagements were arranged. Some 
of the longer excursions were proceeding. In the cathedral and other 
places of worship special sermons were delivered. 

Monday, August 24. — Excursions were continued. Some of the 
Sections held ]\Ieetings in the afternoon. At 8 p.m. in the Lyceum 
Theatre, Pitt Street, Prof. Sir Ernest Eutherford, F.E.S., delivered a 
Discourse on 'Atoms and Electrons.' Sir Oliver J. Lodge, F.E.S., 
ex-President, presided. The lecturer summarised the history of doc- 
trines concerning the unit of matter from ancient times to the present, 
and then led up to some of the alternative forms of the modern elec- 
trical theory of the constitution of the atom, giving reasons for his 
own preference for the view of a central positively charged nucleus 
surrounded by a number of negative electrons revolving in astronomical 
orbits round it, the number being closely connected with the appropriate 
atomic weight or position in Mendeleef's series. Professor Pollock 
proposed a vote of thanks to the lecturer. A ball was given at tlie 
Town Hall by invitation of the Eight Hon. the Lord Mayor (Alderman 
Eichards). 

Tuesday, August 25. — All the Sections met in the morning, and 
some continued their sessions in the afternoon. The Committee of 
Eecommendations met in the Senate Eoom at 2.30 p.m. An excursion 
in Sydney Harbour was given in the afternoon by invitation of the 
Commissioners of the Harbour Trust. 

At 8 P.M. in the Town Hall Professor H. H. Turner, F.E.S., 
delivered a Citizens' Lecture on ' Comets.' The chair was taken by 
Mr. Meredith Atkinson. 

A Conversazione offered by the Senate at the University was can- 
celled owing to the death, on the previous day, of the Chancellor of the 
University, Sir H. N. MacLaurin. Honorary degrees were to have 
been conferred on the following Members: — Prof. W. Bateson, Prof. 
F. 0. Bower, Prof. E. G. Coker, Prof. A. Dendy, Prof. E. 'c. K. 
Conner, Prof. W. A. Herdman, Sir Everard im Thurn, Prof. B. Moore, 
Prof. J. Perry, Prof. E. B. Poulton, Prof. H. H. Turner. These 
degrees were conferred subsequently in absentid. 

Some of the members of the Overseas Party (to the number of 
26), who, owing to the war and the cancellation of the sailing of the 
E.M.S. Orvieto, found it incumbent upon them to hasten their depar- 
ture from Australia, left Sydney this evening by train in order to join 
the P. &amp; 0. E.M.S. Malwa, homeward bound, at Adelaide. 

_ Some of those who left thus early (by this or other routes) had 
originally intended to proceed to Brisbane ; on the other hand, some 
who had intended to visit New Zealand, where the official arrangements 
had been abandoned, now desired to be included in the Brisbane party. 

z z 2 



708 NARRATIVE AND ITINERARY 

These eleventh-hour alterations created a difficult situation for the 
Executive at Brisbane, but it was ably and generously dealt with. 
Members now desiring to be included in the Brisbane party w-ere 
allowed, so far as possible, to take the places of those who no longer 
desired inclusion, the party (of 182 members) being kept at or about the 
total number originally arranged for. Members of the Brisbane Execu- 
tive attended at Sydney and worked with the general organisers in 
rearranging the party : the allocation of railway accommodation for the 
journey north from Sydney had to be recast, and the Brisbane Execu- 
tive had in the short time available to make many new dispositions 
in regard to guests and hosts, but they were able to distribute complete 
Information Lists on the special trains in ample time before Brisbane 
was reached. Of that section of the party which did not proceed 
to Brisbane some stayed in Sydney or made other independent arrange- 
ments; a few, under the informal leadership of Sir E. Eutherford, 
F.E.S., visited New Zealand. 

Wednesdmj, August 26. — Some of the Sections met in the morning. 

The first special sleeping-car train left for Brisbane at 12.40 and 
the second at 1.50 p.m. Dinner was served at Singleton, where the 
President and other official Members (travelling on the first train) were 
received by the Mayor. 

Brisbane, August 27 — September 1. 

Thursday, August 27. — The trains reached Wallangarra, at the fron- 
tier between New South Wales and Queensland, about 7.25 and 8.5 a.m. 
respectively. Here breakfast was provided, the Members, at this meal 
and luncheon at Toowoomba, being the guests of the Queensland 
Government. Tickets for these meals had been distributed on the 
trains during the previous day's journey, together with ribbon-badges 
which constituted free passes over the tramways in Brisbane. A 
break of gauge occurs at Wallangarra. the Queensland Government 
lines being of 3 ft. 6 in. gauge. Members continued their journey from 
this point in two special trains, which reached Brisbane at 5.33 and 
6.15 P.M. respectively. The party was accompanied from Wallangarra 
to Toowoomba by the General Traffic Manager at Toowoomba, and 
thenceforward by the Deputy Commissioner for Eailways. The Deputy 
Mayor of Toowoomba (Mr. T. A. Price) welcomed official Members 
as the first train passed. By the courtesy of the railway officials, 
the second train made two short stops, enabling passengers to alight 
while passing through the fine scenery of the ranges near Toowoomba. 

Friday, August 28. — The Eeception Eoom was established in the 
former Government House, now occupied by the University. 

At 10 A.M. in the Albert Hall Mr. A. D. Hall, F.E.S., delivered 
the second part of his Presidential Address to Section M (Agriculture), 
dealing in particular with tropical agriculture, and at 11.30 a.m. in the 
same place Professor E. W. Brown. F.E.S., Vice-President of Sec- 
tion A (Mathematics and Physics), delivered an address in the Depart- 
ment of Cosmical Physics. 

In the afternoon some of the official and other leading Members were

entertained to luncheon by the Senate of the University. Mr. E. H. 
Roe, M.A., Vice-Chancellor, was in the chair, and the President, 
Professor Bateson, expressed the thanks of the Members. Opportunity 
was given for short excursions through Brisbane by tram-car. The 
Worshipful the Mayor held a Civic Reception in Bowen Park. 

A small party left Brisbane for Dulacca (returning on the following 
Sunday evening) to inspect the experiments being conducted there by 
Dr. Jean White for the extermination of the prickly pear. 

In the evening, at 8.30, discourses were given in the Centennial 
Hall by Professor H. E. Armstrong, F.E.S., on 'The Materials, 
of Life,' and in the Albert Hall by Professor G. W. 0. Howe on 
' ^Yireless Telegraphy.' At the first the President was in the chair. 
Professor Armstrong discussed the part played by chemistry in the 
investigation of his subject, and sho\\ed how simpler compcnds of 
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen were built up into the more 
complicated substances found in the plant ; he then traced the breaking 
up of these in digestion and the further formation from simpler sub- 
stances of the more complex materials of the animal's body. Professor 
B. D. Steele proposed a vote of thanks. 

Sir Oliver Lodge, F.R.S., presided at the discourse by Professor 
Howe, who, after explaining the principles of the subject, traced their 
practical application in the development of the various systems of wire- 
less telegraphy. A number of lantern slides were shown, illustrating 
the construction of modern high-power stations. Sir A. Cowley pro- 
posed, and Professor Luigi Luiggi seconded, a vote of thanks to the 
lecturer. 

SalurJay, August 29, was devoted to excursions. Opportunity was 
afforded for visits to the Ipswich railway workshops and the vicinity 
of the town; to Nambour and the Blackall Range (an excursion 
arranged for and taken advantage of by a large party, amounting to 
some two-thirds of the visiting Members) ; to the Glass House Moun- 
tains, to visit which a small party left the special train to Nambour and 
proceeded on foot to the summit of i\Iount Ngun Xgun and to the 
bottom of the cliffs on Mount Crookneck, rejoining the special train on 
its return; through the Cleveland district, south of the Brisbane River, 
and to Mount Coot-tha, a view-point within the metropolitan area. 
At Namboiu- the Moreton Central Sugar Mill was inspected, and at 
luncheon the visitors were welcomed by the Mayor of Nambour and 
the Maroochy Shire Council. The Range and the Maroochy river were 
subsequently visited, and tea was served on the return to Nambour. 
A longer excursion undertaken by some of the IMembers was that to 
Gympie Goldfleld, the party being the guests of the Corporation of 
Gympie, and returning to Brisbane on Sunday morning. 

Siuiday, August 30. — As elsewhere, no official arrangements were 
made for the Sunday. At night, however, a few members left for 
Mount Morgan Gold and Copper Mine (420 miles from Brisbane), an 
excursion which lasted until Thursday morning, September 3. 

Monday, August 31. — In the morning an excursion was made by 
steamer down the Brisbane River to the meat-works situated thereon. 



OF THE AUSTRALIAN MEETIKG. 711 

In the afternoon the Hon. the Premier of Queensland gave a garden 
party in the University grounds. In the evening, at 8 p.m., Dr. A. C. 
Haddon dehvered a Citizens' Lecture, in the Exhibition Hall, on 
' Decorative Art in Papua,' the Mayor of Brisbane presiding. 

At 8.30 P.M., in the Centennial Hall, Sir Edward Schafer, F.E.S., 
ex-President, delivered a concluding discourse on ' Australia and the 
British Association.' In the course of his lecture, which was of a 
valedictory character, he drew a comparison between the inhospitable 
conditions encountered by James Cook when he led the first scientific 
expedition on board the Endeavour from Great Britain to the shores of 
Australia, and the conditions of high civilisation and the warm welcome 
which the visiting Members of the British Association found. He 
briefly traced the history of the Association, and showed how tlie 
advancement of science, which is its object, had rendered the visit 
to Australia possible. He dealt with the need for encouraging scientific 
research, with especial regard to the possibilities of the future in 
Australia. The President took the chair, and the Lieutenant-Governor 
of Queensland (Sir Arthur Morgan) and Sir Oliver Lodge, F.E.S. , pro- 
posed and seconded a vote of thanks to the lecturer. Both the Presi- 
dent and Sir Oliver Lodge took occasion to express the deep gratitude 
felt by every visiting ^Member for the magnificent reception accorded 
to the party throughout Australia, and for the unremitting labour by 
which the many residents in Australia who had been concerned in the 
organisation of the Meeting had ensured its success ; in this connection 
the speakers paid an especial tribute to the work of the General 
Organising Secretary, Dr. A. C. D. Eivett, and Mrs. Eivett. 

Letter to the Australian Press. — On the conclusion of the Meeting 
the following letter was addressed to the Press in Perth, Adelaide, 
Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane: — 

To the Editor of the 



Sir, — The meetings of the British Association for the Advancement 
of Science in Australia, at the five capital cities of Perth, Adelaide, 
Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane, have been brought to a close, and 
we desire, before leaving the country, to make public expression of our 
gratitude to the people of the Commonwealth, on behalf, as we feel 
confident that we may, of the whole party of some three hundred 
members who have made the journey from overseas. 

From the moment when the invitation to hold our meetings here 
was extended to the general committee of the Association at the 
Sheffield meeting in 1910, by Sir George Eeid, on behalf of the 
Commonwealth Government and Professor Orme Masson, Chairman of 
the Federal Council, we have met with nothing but goodwill and 
earnest collaboration from all the authorities which have been concerned 
in the arrangements made for our visit and meetings. The Common- 
wealth Government placed a large sum at the disposal of our Council 
as a contribution towards the expenses incurred by upwards of 
150 of our members in making the voyage. The Governments of the 



712 NARRATIVE AND ITINERARY 

various States have contributed freely towards the expenses involved 
by the very elaborate and complete arrangements made locally for the 
meetings, and have, moreover, provided each overseas member with a 
pass over their railway systems covering a, period of sis weeks, while 
their Railways Commissioners have made admirable provision for the 
transport of our large party between the different centres of meeting, 
and in connection with excursions during our stay at these centres. 
Moreover, in dealing with many intricate details of organisation, both 
before and during the meeting, we have been always able to I'ely on 
the cordial advice and help of representatives of the Government both 
in this country and at home. The establishment of a central office for 
the purposes of organisation in Australia, in the Commonwealth Govern- 
ment buildings in Melbourne, under the conduct of Dr. A. C. D. Eivett, 
has proved to be the wisest method of ensuring constant and thorough 
collaboration with our own permanent office in London during the past 
eighteen months, and between the many authorities in Australia, and 
has guaranteed that uniformity of organising work in the various centres 
which has contributed so largely to the successful working of the meet- 
ing as a whole. The Universities in the five centres have placed their 
buildings unreservedly at the services of the Association, and municipal 
and other authorities owning buildings have been no less generous. 

To all those of our colleagues and helpers in Australia, who as 
chairmen or members of the Federal Council, general committees, 
executive committees, and hospitality committees, as local secretaries 
and treasurers, as organisers of excursions, information stewards, 
assistants in the reception rooms, or in other capacities, official and 
unofficial, have freely taken upon themselves labours, often arduous 
and prolonged, in connection with the meeting, we venture to offer 
this general expression of our heartfelt thanks ; we cannot hope to do 
justice in every case to individual effort. The hospitality, both private 
and public, which has been extended to visitors throughout the' journey 
has exceeded any possible expectation. 

Finally, we desire to acknowledge very gratefully the extraordinary 
public interest which has been aroused in the proceedings of the meet- 
ing, and, moreover, has been maintained in face of the lamentable 
events which have occurred in Europe during our stay here. A prac- 
tical illustration of that interest .is afforded by the fact that a much 
greater number of members has been enrolled for this Australian meet- 
ing than for any previous meeting in the history of the Association. 
The importance of a large local membership to the interests and 
advancement of science, which is the sole object of the Association, has 
already been explained, and is cleai'ly very well understood, in Australia. 
"We need not labour the point, but may conclude by assuring the people 
of Australia that the announcement of a grand total for the meetings, in 
all centres, of more than 4,700 members' forms, in our view, a fitting 

* The exact number of Overseas Members and local Members and Associates 
was 4,930. The local enrolment was made up as follows — Adelaide, 599; Mel- 
Louriie, 2.017 ; Sydney, 1,780 ; Brisbane, 234.

Homeward Voyage. —After the conclusion of the Brisbane session 
the party became further divided. Of nearly 100 members who did 
not immediately return south about forty waited in Brisbane for the 
Burns Philp s.s. Montoro, which sailed on September 3 for Northern 
Queensland, Java, and Singapore. Others made various individual 
arrangements. A party of 88, however, was conveyed south by a 
special train leaving Brisbane on September 1 at 8.30 a.m., and reach- 
ing \Yallangarra in the evening, where members were transferred to a 
special sleeping-car train, which reached Sydney shortly after noon on 
September 2. Beyond this point no further special transport arrange- 
ments were required. Sixty-three of the Members sailed from Australia 
on the P. &amp; 0. E.M.S. Morea, which left Sydney on September -3, 
Melbourne on September 8, and Adelaide on September 10, but these 
members made individual arrangements as to joining the ship, and 
some did so at each of the three ports nartied. 

Visit to Tasmania. — A party of twenty-one Members, under the 
leadership of Professor T. Thomson Flynn. visited Tasmania, leaving 
j\lelbourne by the s.s. Loongana on September 5, and arriving at 
Launceston on September 6. At Launceston the Museum and the 
Cataract Gorge were visited, and on September 7 the party proceeded 
to Hobart by rail. On September 8 receptions were held at the Town 
Hall, the Museum, and the University, and an official luncheon at 
Government House was given by His Excellency the Governor of 
Tasmania, Sir W. Ellison-Macartney, and Lady Ellison-Macartney. 
In the evening Dr. G. T. Moody lectured on ' Some Commercial Aspects 
of Education.' On September 9 Mount ^Yellington was visited, and 
on September 10 several other excursions took place in the neighbour- 
hood of Hobart. On September 11 the party proceeded to Maria Island 
on the east coast, where geological, zoological, and botanical collections 
were made and dredging was carried out in the neighbouring sea. On 
September 13 the kitchen middens at Little Swan Port were explored, 
and the party returned to Hobart, the principal part of the programme 
liaving been completed. The zoologists, liowever, remained, and 
Professor Dendy gave an address to the Eoyal Society of Tasmania on 
' Progressive Evolution. ' Dr. W. M. Tattersall gave a public lecture 
on ' The Depths of the Sea. ' On September 16 the zoological parly 
proceeded to the Great Lake and carried out collecting in the lake and 
its neighbourhood, returning to Hobart on September 22.

Notes on Scientific AYork in Australia. 

Throughout the sessions in the various centres, in addition to the 
official meetings and excursions, special meetings, discussions and 
expeditions, informal as well as formal, were arranged by local men of 
science for particular groups in the Overseas Party. On such occa- 
sions (among which may be included the visits paid to University 
laboratories, museums and other institutions by many of the party) 
problems for investigation were pointed out and plans for future 
research were suggested, of value to hosts and guests alike, and it is 
not improbable that some of these informal conferences may have as 
great a direct effect upon the advancement of Science in Australia as 
the more public Meetings of the Association. As the Eeport volume 
does not elsewhere offer any occasion to indicate the work done in these 
directions, a summary may be given here, with reference to the Sec- 
tions wdiose interests were specially concerned. The list of Eesearch 
Committees appointed on the recommendation of the Committee of 
Eecommendations meeting at Sydney will show that in many dejDart- 
nients of Science, under several Sections, important suggestions for 
research were given effect. 

In Section A, owing to the unfortunate absence through ill-health 
of the President, Professor Trouton, his address w-as read by Professor 
A. W. Porter. The attendance at the Sectional Meetings was good at 
both Melbourne and Sydney ; and specially large audiences gathered to 
hear the discussions on 'Atoms and Molecules' (jointly 'with Sec- 
tion B: opened by Sir E. Eutherford, followed by Professors Pope, 
Armstrong, Kerr Grant, Hicks, and others, with Sir O. Lodge in the 
chair), on ' Antarctic Meteorology ' (opened by Dr. Simpson, followed 
by Captain Davis, J\Ir. Gold, and others), and on ' AYireless Telegraphy ' 
(opened by Sir 0. Lodge). Sir E. Eutherford's paper was also of 
special interest. A paper by Mr. Baracchi, Government Astronomer 
of A^ictoria, on the proposed site for a Solar Observatory on Mount 
Stromlo was of particular interest to the Astronomers, and the Prime 
Minister of the Commonwealth (Mr. Cook) received a deputation ^ of 

f* The Astronomer Royal, Professors Turner, Eddington, Duffield, and 
Nicholson, Mr. C. G. Abbot, of Washington, Sir Oliver Lodge, introduced 
by Professor Masson. Mr. Deakin and :Mr. Hunt, Government "Meteorologist, 
•were also present.

astronomers and plusicists on this project, and accorded them a favour- 
able hearing. In Sydney the local branch of the British Astronomical 
Association requested, throuoh tlie President, Dr. Roseby, a visit from 
the Astronomers ; and the Astronomer Eoyal, Professors E. ^Y. Brown, 
Eddington, Nicholson and Turner and Mr. C. G. Abbot attended and 
addressed the meeting. The Sydney brancli of the Mathematical Asso- 
ciation also invited some visiting matliematicians to address them ; 
Professors Perry and Turner responded to Professor Carslaw's invita- 
tion. The different State observatories (Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne 
and Sydney) and Mr. Tebbutt's private observatory at Windsor, 
N.S.W., were all visited by several astronomers, and as a result of 
friendlv discussion of problems and difficulties, invited by the directors 
of the observatories, several memoranda were drawn up by the visitors. 

The geologists of the party in Western Australia, under the local 
guidance of Professor Woolnough, visited the Irwin Eiver to examine 
the Permo-Carboniferous glacial beds, marine beds and coal measures, 
the Darling Eanges to see the crush-conglomerates of Pre-Cambrian 
age, the Stirling Eanges with their highly contorted ciuartzites of un- 
known age, and finally the goldfields of Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie. At 
the time of the Adelaide meeting a party of geologists and chemists 
visited Port Pirie and Broken Hill for the purpose of seeing the occur- 
rence of the ores and the methods of working and smelting. Another 
party at the same time visited the Sturt Eiver to see the Cambrian 
glacial beds, and explored the Permo-Carboniferous glacial beds and the 
archseocyathine limestones of Halletfs Cove, and finally the granitic 
rocks in the neighbourhood of Victor Plarliour. From Melbourne the 
geologists went to Macedon to examine the alkaline igneous rocks and 
to Bacchus Marsh for the Permo-Carboniferous glacial tillites lying 
upon striated surfaces of older rocks. 

From Sydney there were excursions of both geological and biological 
interest to the Blue Mountains, which afforded the geologists an oppor- 
tunity of studying the leading features of the geological structure of 
New South Wales and the remarkable elevation which this, in common 
with many other parts of the Continent, experienced in late Tertiary 
or post-Tertiary times. An examination was also made of the Jenolan 
Caves, which are typical examples of stalactitic caves in limestone of 
Silurian age, one of the interesting features of which was the remains 
of an aboriginal skeleton embedded in the stalagmitic floor. The excur- 
sion to W^est Maitland and Newcastle gave an opportunity of examining 
the productive coal measures of the State. 

At Brisbane two of the most notable excursions arranged for 
geologists were those to the Glass House Mountains, a series of 
trachytic volcanic necks rising abruptly from the plain, and to Ipswich 
to examine the Trias-.Jura coal measures and associated volcanic rocks. 

Some of the most notew'orthy points that impressed the geologists 
from Europe were the remarkable extent on the Australian Continent of 
Permo-Carboniferous glaciation, the evidence of comparatively recent 
extensive elevation, the well-preserved plains of erosion at different 
geological horizons, and the evidences of glaciation as early as the 
Cambrian epoch. 



716 NARRATIVE AND ITINERARY 

At each centre visited the zoologists of the party were in close touch 
with the professor of the subject at the University and other local 
workers, and many of the excursions, both those in the official pro- 
gramme and others of a more informal character, were arranged so 
as to show the visiting specialists as much as possible of the Australian 
fauna. 

At Perth, in addition to the definitely zoological excursions to the 
Yallingup caves and to the Mundaring Weir, Professor Dakin arranged 
to take a few of the zoologists to visit points of interest on the Darling 
Eange, where Peripatus and other important organisms were found. 

From Adelaide parties of zoologists made observing and collecting 
trips to Lake Alexandrina, Victor Harbour on the coast, the Mount 
Lofty Eange, and elsewhere, at all of which objects of interest were 
seen and much material collected which may lead to research. 

At Melbourne the local naturalists arranged several short trips in 
the neighbourhood to study the birds and the land fauna generally; 
while at Sydney the excursions were naturally rather of a marine 
biological character. Professor Haswell and Dr. S. J. Johnstone 
organised a collecting party in Port Jackson in order to explore from a 
steam launch the wonderfully rich invertebrate fauna exposed at low 
tide in various parts of the harbour. 

From Sydney, again, the various excursions to the Blue Mountains 
and the Jenolan Caves gave zoologists the opportunity of collecting 
such rare and interesting forms as Peripatus and land Planarians and 
of seeing many of the characteristic birds and insects of the country; 
and the same may be said of some of the excursions from Brisbane. 

At the Museums and University laboratories of Perth, Adelaide, 
Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane informal discussions and conferences 
took place with the Museum Curators and other local naturalists, which 
led to the formation of Research Committees or to plans for future 
work on Australian problems. 

In connection with the marine fauna, the question of more fully 
exploring the Australian fisheries was under consideration at several 
centres, and it seems probable that a more thorough investigation of 
the coastal waters and their contained plankton, by modern oceano- 
graphical methods, will be undertaken at an early date,. Another out- 
come of informal conversations was the resolution brought before the 
Committee of Eecommendations for adoption by the Council of the 
Association welcoming the project to convert a portion of Kangaroo 
Island in South Australia into a Government Eeserve for the protection 
of the fast-disappearing native land fauna. 

The facilities given to members of Section E (Geography) to study 
on the spot various types of land-forms in Australia were especially 
valued by those whose interests lie mainly in physical geography. 
Others had tlie opportunity of observing the influence of geographical 
factors, notably temperature an4 rainfall, upon the more important 
forms of economic activity in the country. The visit to "Western 
Australia and the excursions to Yanco, Bendigo, and Gympie were of 
especial interest. Some members took advantage of their stay in the 
different capitals to make themselves acquainted with the literature 
relating to the discovery and early settlement of the Continent. 



OF THE AUSTRALIAN MEETING. 717 

Probably the communication to the Anthropological Section which 
will be regarded as of greatest scientific importance was the exposition 
by Professors David and Wilson, at Sydney, of the highly mineralised 
skull of an Australian man, probably of Pleistocene date. This skull, 
which shows certain features in common with that of the Sussex Pilt- 
down skull, was found some thirty years ago on the Darling Downs, and 
Professor David was foi'tunately able, on an excursion subsequent to 
the Meeting, to find the original discoverer of the skull and obtain exact 
particulars as to the locality and mode of occurrence. 

Opportunities were given wherever possible to allow the anthro- 
pologists to see for themselves the aborigines and their craftsmanship. 
Thus, from Adelaide, under the guidance of Professor Stirling, a party 
went to Milang on Lake Alexandrina to inspect a number of men, 
women, and children from the Mission Station, including some full- 
blooded aborigines. These gave displays of dancing, boomerang- 
throwing, hut-building, and basket-making, and some of the party 
collected information in regard to cat's-cradle games and native 
genealogies. 

The anthropological collections in the Museums at Melbourne, 
Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane, and Perth were naturally of great interest, 
and under the guidance of the curators and other local anthropologists 
there were important discussions and critical examination of specimens 
by experts, which will doubtless lead to fm'ther research. 

In the Melbourne Museum the magnificent collections of Australian 
stone implements, especially brought together for the occasion by 
Messrs. Kenyon and Mahony, as well as the ceremonial objects collected 
by Professor Spencer, were on exhibition during the meeting, and were 
the subject of careful examination and discussion. Much of the more 
productive scientific work of the anthropologists naturally consisted in 
informal conferences with the local workers, and it was hoped that as 
one of the results of such consultations it might be possible to obtain 
from the Federal Government the assistance which is necessaiy for the 
prosecution of further research in the fast-disappearing cultural anthro- 
pology of the tribes in the Northern Territory. 

Field-work naturally played a large part in the botanical pro- 
gramme. At Perth an extended expedition to Albany, lasting for the 
greater part of a week, gave opportunities for studying the characteristic 
vegetation of the arid districts of Western Australia. From Adelaide 
there were three important excursions arranged specially for botanical 
work — one to study the Salicornia Scrub and the mangrove swamps 
of the coastal region, one to the Mount Lofty Eange to see the fern 
gullies and the scrub of the higher le^-els, and the third to Mannum. 

The botanical excursions from Melbourne arranged by Professor 
Ewart included one to Emerald for the fern gullies, while a smaller 
party went on to visit Dr. MacArthur's station to inspect the methods 
of orchard planting. Another party was taken to Warburton to inspect 
a characteristic ' big-tree ' region and study the ecology of the district. 

From Sydney, in addition to the excursions to the Blue Mountains 
and to the Jenolan Caves district, of great interest to botanists as well 
as geologists, there were a number of smaller informal excursions under 



718 NARRATIVE AND ITINERARY 

the guidance of Professor Lawson to study the botany of the Port 
Jackson neiglibourhood, including the National Park. Another 
important botanical party, under the direction of Mr. Maiden, visited 
the BuUi Pass and the Cataract Dam, passing through interesting 
country and a rich fern vegetation. Mr. Maiden also conducted the 
botanists over the Sydney Botanic Gardens and gave a special expositiom 
of the Herbarium. 

Of special botanical interest was the excursion from Brisbane to 
JNambour and the Blackall Ranges, showing sugar-cane cultivation and 
many ferns, aerial orchids and other characteristic plants of the upland 
gullies. 

Before the regular work of the Association began several members 
of the Agricultural Section took the opportunity of .gaining some 
acquaintance ^^ith the special conditions of farming prevailing in 
Australia. 

The chief questions that occupied the attention of the Section both 
in session and out of doors were dry farming, irrigation, and the breed- 
ing of cereals. In South Australia dry-farming methods were receiving 
a searching test because of the prevailing drought. Notwithstanding, 
the wheat after fallow showed little sign of flagging, and impressed 
everyone by its brilliant green colour. Visits were paid to the Eose- 
worthy Experimental Farm in South Australia and the Werribee Farm 
in Victoria. At both places experiments were in progress to illustrate 
the effects of various cultivations and of taking a fodder crop before 
the wheat. This raises one of the most important problems . in 

Australian wheat-growing, the maintenance of the fertility of the soil 
under continuous cropping. At present it is contended that the system 
of alternate wheat and fallow, still more so the rotation of wheat, 
stubble grazed by sheep, fallow, does not result in any diminution of 
the nitrogen content of the soil. Accurate data, however, are lacking, 
and as it is difficult to understand how the normal recuperative actions 
in the soil should be sufficient to maintain the stock of nitrogen it is 
desirable that this question, fundamental for the future of Australian 
farming, should be submitted to rigorous examination. Dry-fanning 
problems were discussed generally by the President, and in a valuable 
paper by Dr. Lyman Briggs, who summarised the extensive investiga- 
tions on the water requirements of plants that have recently been 
carried out at various stations in the Great Plains of North America. 
Several of the points brought out — the comparatively low water require- 
ment of the millets and sorghums and the great variation in the water 
requirements of various strains of lucerne — are likely to become of 
practical value. As regards irrigation, in addition to the discussion at 
Melbourne, the ^Members of the Section visited the small irrigation 
colonies on the lower Murray, the colonies at Bacchus Marsh and 
Werribee, near Melbourne, and the gi-eat Yanco settlement in New 
South Wales, where a meeting was also held and papers read. On the 
subject of cereal-breeding a fruitful discussion took place in Sydney. 
Mr. Beaven brought out the importance of what he terms the migration 
factor, not only in determining the yield of a given variety, but also 
as a means of picking out the high-yielding varieties among the gi'eat 



OF THE AUSTRALIAN MEETING. 719 

number of seedlings with which the breeder always has to deal. It was 
pointed out that the value of several of Farrer's wheats must be due 
to their high migration factor. Farrer's work was discussed at some 
length, and the President of the Association pointed out how he worked 
on IMendelian lines in pre-Mendelian days, in that he bred his stocks 
from individuals picked out in the second and succeeding generations 
of cross-breds. 

Dairying is an industry of great importance in Australia, and 
received considerable attention in the Section by means of discussions on 
milk yields and milk records, and on the current types of milking 
machines, without which dairying can hardly be carried on in Aus- 
tralia. Some of the members of the Section interested in this side 
of the work spent a large proportion of their available time amongst the 
dairying in the coastal districts of New South ^Yales and Queensland, 
and were greatly impressed by the labour-saving devices that have 
there been adopted. The problems of wool character and wool inherit- 
ance were raised both in the meetings and in the field, and though it 
will be long before so complex a character is brought under control, 
the question did receive some elucidation which may serve as a basis 
for future work. 

The members of the Section owe a particular debt of thanks to the 
Agricultural Departments of the various States ; in every case special 
arrangements were made for them, individually and collectively, so that 
each man had the opportunity of seeing the local work in which he was 
most interested. 

Eesolutiox by the Couxcil. 

At the Meeting of the Council of the Association held in London on 
November 6, 1914, it was resolved: — 

' That the Council of the British As-sociation for the Advancement of 
Science, at its first Meeting in London since the return of Members from 
Au.stralia, desires to place on record its high appreciation of the generous recep- 
tion given to the Members of the Overseas Party throughout the Commonwealth 
by representatives of the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States, 
and by other authorities and Australian citizens generally, on the occasion of 
the Meeting of the Association in Australia in 1914. The Council hereby 
expresses its grateful thanks for the hospitality, privileges and concessions 
extended -so freely to visiting Members, and also for the willing and valuable 
collaboration of all those who undertook so successfully the work of organisation 
in Australia in connection with the Meeting.' 



720 VISIT OF MEMBERS TO HAVRE. 



VISIT OF MEMBERS OP THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION TO 
THE MEETING OF L'ASSOCIATION FRANQAISE POUR 
L'AA^\NCEMENT DES SCIENCES, LE HAVRE, 1914. 

It was reported to the Council in November 1912 that a letter had 
been received from Dr. A. Loir, Director of the Bureau d'Hygiene, of 
Havre, and Local Secretary for the Meeting of L 'Association Francaise 
pour I'Avancement des Sciences in Havre in 1914, intimating that that 
Association and the municipality of Havre desired to invite as guests 
leading Members of the British Association who might not be attending 
the Meeting in Australia, and that all Members not attending that 
Meeting ^^ ould be welcomed at the ^Meeting of the French Association ; 
also proposing that the Conference of Delegates should meet in Havre. 
Information had also been received from Dr. Loir that a Local Com- 
mittee, including some of the principal British residents in Havre, had 
been formed for the reception of [Members of the British Association if 
the above invitation were accepted. The Council resolved that the 
invitation be cordially accepted, in general terms, and that details of the 
arrangements be left in the hands of the President and General Officers, 
with the assistance of the following Committee : Dr. J. G. Garson, Dr. 
A. Vernon Harcourt, and Dr. P. Chalmers Mitchell. The Committee 
was empowered to add to its number. 

It was decided in 1913, after .discussion by the Corresponding 
Societies Committee, the Conference of Delegates at the Birmingham 
Meeting, the General Committee and the Council, that the Conference 
of Delegates should meet at Havre in 1914. 



-o"- 



Beport to the Council of the British Association of the Committee for 
the Havre Meeting of V Association Frangaise pour VArancemeut des 
Sciences. 

The Committee have to report that the Havre Meeting of the Association 
Fran9aise pour rAvancement des Sciences was held at Le Havre from the 
27th to the 31st of July. Owing to the political situation it was found neces- 
sary to curtail the duration of the Meeting somewhat. 

About forty Members and Associates of the British Association attended, and 
received a most cordial reception from their French confreres; several of them 
were also very hospitably entertained during the Meeting. 

The final list of delegate officials from the British As.sociation was as 
follows : — 

Sir William Ramsay, K.C.B., F.R.S., Premier Delegate. 

Sir Edward Brabrook. C.B. 

Dr. J. G. Garson, Chairman of the Havre Committee. 

Dr. F. A. Bather, D..?c., F.R.S. , Delegate of the Museums Association. 

Professor A. H. Reginald Buller, Ph.D., University of Manitoba. 

At the General Inaugural Meeting Sir William Ramsay gave an eloquent 
address in French, which was much appreciated by the audience. 

Two meetings of the Conference of Delegates of Corresponding Societies were 
held ; the first under the presidency of Sir Edward Brabrook, who in the absence 



VISIT OF MEMBERS TO HAVEE. 721 

of Sir George Fordham, the Chairman of the Conference, read the address 
prepared by the latter. The ordinary business of the Conference was proceeded 
•with. The second Conference was held under the presidency of M. Ray, and the 
organisation of French societies was discussed. 

At the concluding general meeting Sir William Eamsay again addressed the 
meeting, and returned thanks on behalf of the Members of the British Association. 

Several papers were contributed to the proceedings of Sections by Members 
of the British Association. An important discussion took place on ' Units of 
Measure,' and the question was asked whether the British Association would be 
■willing to consider the matter and co-operate with the French Association. 

No report of the Havre Meeting would be complete without allusion to the 
splendid work done in connection with it by Dr. Loir, the Local Secretary. To 
him the British Association visitors are very greatly indebted for his attention 
to their welfare and assistance during their stay at Havre. 

The Committee also gratefully acknowledge the assistance and attention to 
the Members and Associates by H.B.M. Consul at Havre, Mr. C. V. Churchill. 

The best thanks of the Association are due to Sir William Eamsay for his 
services as spokesman and the eflScient manner in which he discharged the duties 
of premier delegate. 

The Committee recommend that the thanks of the British Association should 
be formally transmitted to the French Association for this opportunity of 
friendly and fraternal co-operation between the scientific men of both countries, 
and to Professor Gautier, the President, M. Jules Siegfried, Deputy, the 
Maire of Havre, and Dr. Loir. 

The above recommendations were carried out by order of the Council.

Sir George Fordham has promised to preside at the Conference of 
Delegates to be held at Havre at the invitation of the French Associa- 
tion for the Advancement of Science, and to give an Address on ' The 
History of the Endeavour to Co-ordinate the Work of Local Scientific 
Societies in Great Britain. ' 

The Committee recommends that the following subjects should be 
discussed at the Conference : — ■ 

' Local Natural History Societies and their Publications, ' and ' The 
Question of the Compilation of an Index to the latter. ' The first sug- 
gested by the Hertfordshire Natural History Society, to be introduced 
by Mr. John Hopkinson, and the second to be discussed by Mr. William 
Cole and Mr. Henry Whitehead on behalf of the Essex Field Club. 

The Committee wishes to express its thanks to Mr. W. P. D. 
Stebbing for his services as Secretary, which he has had to relinquish 
owing to his absence abroad. The Committee asks to be reappointed, 
and applies for a grant of 251.

of Science for having invited the Conference of Delegates to meet at Havre, and 
then proceeded to read the Chairman's Address on : — 

The History of the Endeavour to Co-ordinate the Work of Local 
Scientific Societies in Great Britain. 

More than thirty years have now elapsed from the period when an attempt 
was first made to group the local scientific societies of Great Britain and Ire- 
land round the British Association, and to co-ordinate their work of local 
research and investigation on settled lines with that of the Association. It is 
possibly, therefore, an appropriate time for reviewing shortly, in the form of a 
presidential address, the results of this movement, and the success it has 
achieved. The initiative in this matter is due to Mr. John Hopkinson, then as 
now the moving spirit of the Hertfordshire Natural History Society, who, in a 
letter printed in ' Nature ' on August 5, 1880, suggested a Conference of officials 
and annual delegates of local scientific societies during the meetings of the 
British Association. Such a meeting, small and i:.rormal, was held during the 
British Association week at Swansea, in August 1S80, when twelve representa- 
tives were present from nine societies. Mr. Hopkinson was chairman of the 
meeting, and the following resolutions were adopted : That this Conference 
recommends that at future meetings of the British Association the delegates 
from the various scientific societies should meet with the view of promoting 
the best interests of the Association and of the several societies represented ; 
that Mr. Hopkinson and Mr. H. George Fordham be a Committee to carry out 
the views expressed at this Conference, and report to the Conference of Dele- 
gates to be held at York in 1881, in accordance with the foregoing resolution. 

In the result, four successive annual conferences were held : at York (1881), 
at Southampton (1882), at Southport (1883), and at Montreal (1884). They 
were arranged by a small Committee, and the expenses were met by contributions 
to a fund formed for the purpose by the delegates themselves. The interest in 
this movement was a growing one, and at the meeting in Montreal thirty-eight 
societies were represented by thirty-one delegates. During the five years of 
voluntary activity in this matter— to 1884 — many circulars and notices were 
printed and issued to societies, and representations were made to the Bi'itish 
Association itself in furtherance of the idea of co-operation upon which these 
preliminary Conferences were based. The minutes of these early Conferences 
and the discussions and reports they include, with some manuscript addition, 
as the copies now in my hands have been completed, make up twenty-two pages 
of octavo. In similar form a 'circular referring to subjects recommended for 
investigation by local scientific societies ' issued by their Committee runs to eight 
pages. These thirty pages of print and manuscript contain a great many in- 
teresting discussions and many valuable suggestions, and give the summarised 
history of the movement in its early and unofficial stage. 

It would not serve any useful purpose to analyse now these discussions of 
the suggestions made, and I do not propose to do so, but it seems well to draw 
attention to the effort made in the period 1880-1884, and to found upon it as the 
historical basis of what has been since developed. 

The first stage of the official activity of the British Association in connection 
with local scientific work and organisation was naturally one of inquiry. An 
investigation was set on foot through a Committee of the Association appointed 
in 1882 and reporting in the following year on the lines of what had already 
been done \inofficially, in order to obtain exact and complete knowledge of the 
number of scientific societies in the United Kingdom which could be properly 
classified as ' local,' their con.^titiitions, the number of their members, and their 
objects, and in particular of the character, form, and frequency of their 
publications. It turned out to be an exceedingly tiresome one, but in the end 
the number of societies of a local character of sufficient consequence and 
stability to warrant their being recorded in the list prepared, was found to 
be about 190, as to which the information obtained was grouped in eight 
columns. The following paragi'aphs from the report of 1883 may be recalled : 
' The local societies differ widely in character. Those which are estabbshed 
in lart^e towns, and are not particularly well situated for carrying on systematic 
■^ 3 A 2 



724 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914, 

local investigations, are often of high scientific rank, and their affairs are 
administered in a business-like manner by a regular staff. On the other 
hand, there are numerous smaller societies and field clubs, scattered over the 
country, which are excellently situated for conducting local investigations, 
and are in many cases doing valuable work, but of which so little is generally 
known that it has often been difficult to discover their official addresses. 
In some parts of the country the smaller societies either group themselves 
into what is practically a federation, or else affiliate themselves to some 
large society in their district, and the Committee think that if the local societies 
could more generally be induced to group themselves round what might be 
described as local sub-centres, it would not be difficult to devise methods of 
uniting the representatives of those sub-centres in the performance of interest- 
ing and important duties during the meetings of the British Association, with 
the final effect of establishing systematical local investigation throughout the 
country, and uniformity in the modes of publishing the results. The recom- 
mendations of the Committee will tend wholly in this direction, because, 
although they have considered many plans of fulfilling their instructions in a 
direct manner, no plan recommends itself to them as superior to this indirect 
method in its capacity for producing valuable and durable effects. It can 
hardly be doubted that numerous systematic investigations of a local character 
will continue to be carried on, and that their successful prosecution would 
result in important gains to science. Neither does it appear doubtful that the 
successful prosecution of such investigations by the smaller local societies would 
be greatly encouraged and facilitated by the general interest shown in their 
work by the more influential societies in their neighbourhood, by a watchful 
oversight, a readiness to discuss and publish results, and by the personal in- 
fluence of their leading members. The Committee offer the recommendations 
they are about to make in the trust that they will serve to remind the more 
important local societies of the high and useful function they are able to per- 
form by entering into friendly and helpful relations with the small and scat- 
tered societies of the respective districts, and by offering themselves as their 
scientific representatives wherever representations may be necessary.' 

Subsequently, at a meeting of the General Committee of the Association held 
in London, on November 11, 1884 (by adjournment from Montreal), Eules 
proposed by the Council, upon the recommendations of the Committee of 
1882-3 were finally adopted, and incorporated with the Rules of the Asso- 
ciation. In accordance with the new rules a ' Corresjxjnding Societies Com- 
mittee,' consisting of (as then printed) : Mr. F. Galton (Chairman), Professor 
Williamson, Captain D. Galton, Sir J. D. Hooker, Professor Flower, Professor 
Boyd Dawkins, Sir Rawson Rawson, Dr. Garson, Mr. J. Evans, Mr. J. 
Hopkinson, Mr. Meldola, Mr. Whitaker, Mr. Symons, and Mr. Fordham 
(Secretary), was appointed by the Council, and thereafter the whole of the work 
previously carried on, or attempted, by a voluntary body became a part of the 
official machinery of the Association, and the history of the official relations 
of the British Association and local scientific societies is found in successive 
annual reports of the Corresponding Societies Committee. These commence in 
1885. In that year the Committee publish the first list of societies recom- 
mended by them for admission to the Roll of Corresponding Societies, 39 in 
number, a selection from amongst 52 applications. They also issue an Index 
List of Papers published during the previous year by these societies, arranged 
in groups according to the subjects referred to the various sections of the 
Association. The Index List in this form has been continued to the present 
time. In the Report for the following year (1886) are incorporated the proceed- 
ings and a report of the discussions which took place in the two Conferences of 
Delegates held during the meeting of the Association. The form of publication 
of this Annual Report and of the matter it contains has been since followed 
systematically. It would be impossible to summarise the whole series of these 
Reports within any reasonable compass, but some salient points mav be noticed. 
As regards the number of societies officially associated with the British Associa- 
tion and the work it carries on the following figures may be given. In 1886 
the societies which nominated delegates for the Conference numbered only 24 ; in 
the following year they were 32. At the end of the first decade, in 1896, they had 



CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES. 725 

risen to 49. In 1906, when an additional class of corresponding societies had 
been created, they rose again to 72. In 1913 and 1913, when only those 
delegates who were present at a Conference were recorded, with the societies 
they represented, the figures are 52 and 55 respectively. This shows actually 
a progressive improvement throughout the whole period in the interest taken 
in the annual Conference and its work. In the same period the list of 
societies enrolled under the rules as Corresponding Societies is : in 1886, 36; in 
1887, 38; in 1896, 66; in 1906, 80; in 1912 and 1913, 114 and 107. Thus the 
system set up in 1884, as since modified from time to time, seems to have 
obtained at least the success of an increasing numerical support for the idea 
of co-ordination of local scientific work through such a central body as the 
British Association. As regards the discussions at the Conferences and the 
various suggestions made, as well as the work done centrally in the endeavour to 
promote the co-ordinated activity of local societies, one is struck in reading 
through the annual Reports, as published from 1886 onwards, with their great 
value and interest. In every form, and with all possible suggestions, and a 
mass of valuable practical knowledge, those discussions have been carried 
on through the whole period. If the fruits of this consideration of the possi- 
bilities of the case had been at all in proportion to the labour and ability 
bestowed on the elucidation of the various subjects discussed, the advance in 
the utility to science of the local societies would be very great indeed. In 1904 
the Chairman of the Conference, in reviewing the situation at that date, 
remarked that the results of the labours of the Conferences of the Delegates of 
Corresponding Societies ' have scarcely been commensurable with the expectations 
of those who instituted this body, or with the possibilities of the situation.' 
Now, ten years later, and speaking as one of those who took part in the creative 
stage of the present system, I am obliged to adopt the same opinion. It is 
certain that this system has been built up with care, and with a cordial desire 
to make it an efficient and helpful machine for the purposes contemplated so far 
as the officers of the British Association are concerned, and with the active and 
zealous assistance of the members of the Corresponding Societies Committee. 
It seems ecjually clear that, scattered throughout the membership of the local 
societies, are a considerable number of persons who have welcomed the efforts of 
the British Association in this direction, and have done their best to support 
them from the side of their societies. From the very beginning the weakness of 
the secretarial staff of the local societies has apparently been the difficulty in 
the way of success. It is hard to see how this difficulty can be got over. It is 
probable that here and there the local work of societies has been directed and 
stimulated, chiefly, no doubt, through the personal action of the delegates 
themselves. 

Having regard to the value of many of the addresses and communications 
submitted to the annual Conferences, covering as they do the whole ground of 
the possible useful activity of local societies, it would seem almost worth con- 
sidering whether the publication of a selection from these materials, grouped in 
some systematic form, could not be undertaken, so as to create a kind of code for 
the guidance of local societies in their activity. 

One very valuable and important work carried on in connection with the 
grouping of Corresponding Societies is that of the compilation of an annual 
Index List of their scientific publications. I endorse the observations on this 
point which are to be found in the Report of the Corresponding Societies 
Committee for 1898 : ' As the great majority of the societies, the main purpose 
of whose existence is local scientific investigation, are now on the list of 
Corresponding Societies, the Index of their most important papers approximates 
to completeness more and more each year as a record of local work.' Whatever 
else may happen, it is to be hoped that this annual List may continue to be 
prepared and published by the British Association. 

I am far from thinking that the attention called to the relations of local 
societies to general scientific work during the long series of meetings held since 
1883 has been useless or ineffective. I believe that in general much good has 
been done throughout the country, and I am sure there is much yet to do in 
this direction. 

Dr. J. G. Garson said that since the Conference had been officially recognised 



726 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 

he had been Chairman twice, and had held the office of Secretary. He 
endorsed Sir George Fordham's opinion with regard to secretaries. He thought 
that honorary work was badly done, and that the duties which secretaries of 
societies were called upon to carry out should be divided. 

Mr. T. Sheppaed (Yorkshire Naturalists' Union) proposed that the 'Confer- 
ence send its best thanks to Sir George Fordham for his Address, which seemed 
a useful summary of the work of the Conference of Delegates. 

On one point he wished to join issue with Dr. J. G. Garson, who had stated 
that honorary secretaries were usually bad secretaries. He knew of several, 
both paid and honoraay, and his experience was usually not in favour of the 
paid official. He certainly found that an honorary secretary was enthusiastic, 
and had his heart and soul in the work, and worked well ,' while, as soon as 
he received a payment, his duties savoured of ' work,' and he lost interest in 
them. In the room were Mr. John Hopkinson, Mr. Lower Carter, Mr. Mark 
Webb, and others, whose work was certainly well known and was honorary. 

Principal Witton Davies (University College, Bangor) seconded the vote 
of thanks to Sir George Fordham, and asked whether it was possible for the 
committee of a museum to send a Delegate to the Conference of Corresponding 
Societies. 

The subjects chosen for discussion were (1) ' Local Natural Histories and 
their Publications,' (2) ' The Question of the Compilation of an Index to the 
Latter.' The first was introduced by Mr. John Hopkinson, F.L.S., F.G.S., in 
the following paper entitled :— 

Local Natural History Societies and their Publications. 

The first essential in opening this discussion is perhaps to define its title so 
that the discussion may be neither too diffuse nor too restricted. I use the term 
' Natural History ' in its widest sense, as covering the whole of Nature on, 
beneath, and immediately above the surface of our earth, and therefore including 
geology and meteorology. The term ' local ' restricts the inquiry to societies 
which are formed to investigate the Natural History of a particular area, such 
area in England usually being a county. When the county is large, a number of 
local societies, having their own independent organisation, may federate, forming 
one composite society such as the Yorkshire Naturalists' LTnion ; and the several 
societies in a number of counties may also do so, for example, the South-Eastern 
Union of Scientific Societies. 

I would therefore restrict the term ' Local Natural History Society ' to those 
formed to investigate the Natural History of their locality, and no others I 
submit have a raison d'ifre. How then can this object best be accomplished? 
It would be impossible to form such a society without suitable material ; men or 
women who study Nature. To bring them together the subscription should not 
be high, nor should there be any distinction of class. All naturalists, whatever 
their social position may be, should be welcomed and slttjuld be invited to 'bring 
before their society the subject of their special study. The next essential is an 
efficient secretary, who, besides having the general management of the society, 
should study its members, pick out the workers, and induce them to lay the 
results of their investigations before the society. At first the result may be 
desultory, but in course of time it will probably become more and more systematic. 
Thus one member may be induced not only to take meteorological observations 
but also to undertake the duty of meteorological recorder, collecting the observa- 
tions of others, and in eveiy county or nearly so there is a more or less numerous 
army of rainfall observers. Another may act as geological recorder, describing 
sections and photographing them, especially those of a temporary nature. Yet 
another may be an ornithologist, the camera here again being most useful, and he 
should be induced to give to the society an annuarreport on the birds which not 
only has he observed himself, but also including the observations of his corre- 
spondents. The most popular of the annual reports of the Eecorders of the 
Hertfordshire Natural History Society is that of the Recorder of Birds, not only 
of our present Recorder, but each one for the last thirty-five years has been so. 
In botany an effort should be made to compile a flora of the county, phanerogamic 
and cryptogamic, if there Is not one of somewhat recent compilation already in 



CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES. 727 

existence, and if there be such a flora the duty of the Eecorder would be to keep 
it up to date by his own observations and those of his correspondents. These are 
merely somewhat random examples of what a local society should do. 

In but few localities, however, can such a society entirely rely upon active 
workers ; there must be drones in the hive to supply the necessary funds by their 
subscriptions and to add to the numbers attending the meetings, and for them it 
will be necessary to provide popular lectures, which are now almost invariably 
illustrated by lantern-slides. In selecting such lectures regard should be had, so 
far as possible, to make them, while entertaining, conducive to serious study, so 
that there may be from time to time drafted from the army of drones recruits to 
swell the less numerous company of workers. The field meetings should be 
designed to investigate some special subject, for instance, the geology, botany, or 
some branch of the zoology of a district, under competent guidance, and while 
they should never be allowed to degenerate into picnics or mere pleasure parties, 
there is no reason why an occasional invitation of hospitality should be refused. 

In a fairly large society the workers may be sufficiently numerous to form 
eections, each with its Recorder or Secretary, but it is only in very large ones 
that the sections should hold meetings to which the members generally are not 
admitted. 

It is scarcely necessary to add that one of the objects of the Society should be 
the formation of a library of works on Natural History, especially of mono- 
graphs or books which will enable species to be identified. 

These brief remarks may suffice to promulgate a discussion on the general scope 
and management of a Local Natural History Society, and I therefore proceed to 
the second part of my title, the Publications of such societies. This I will con- 
sider, and I should like to be discussed, entirely from the point of view of a 
bibliographer. The question is, therefore : How can the publications be rendered 
most useful and most easily referred to and quoted by inquirers on the subjects 
of which they treat? The Editors of many, if not of most of the Local Natural 
History Societies of the British Isles, appear to strive to make this most difficult. 
Therefore I will briefly, and as I have not the time at my disposal to give my 
reasons in detail, it may appear dogmatically, lay down certain rules which I 
think should be strictly adhered to. 

However much or however little is printed in a year, a volume with consecu- 
tive pagination, or it may be with two series of pages, one with Arabic numerals 
for the transactions or papers published, and the other with small Roman or italic 
numerals for the proceedings or accounts of the meetings, should eventually be 
produced, and this volume must not be so thin as to tempt two or more being 
bound in one, nor so thick as to require its being divided when bound. From 
300 to 600 pages is perhaps the greatest latitude which should be allowed to a 
volume, but much will depend upon the thickness of the paper and the number of 
plates. It is immaterial whether two or more such volumes are produced in a 
year, or Avhether one volume takes several years to complete. This volume must 
have a title-page with the date of its completion and place of its publication, a 
table of contents at the beginning and an index at the end, and somewhere within 
it. that is, not only on the covers of the parts which it comprises, the date of 
publication of each part (month and year), with the numbers of the pgges of 
which each part consists. It can then be ascertained at a glance in what part 
any paper appeared and the date of its publication. It is also advisable that 
after the table of contents there should be a list of the plates and of the text- 
figures, in each case showing their position in the volume. 

When authors are supplied with separate copies of their papers the original 
pagination must be maintained, and in such copies, not only on their covers, must 
be printed the name of the publication, which may be abbreviated, and the 
volume, part, and date (month and year). As copies of papers may be cut out of 
a volume it is an excellent plan, now adopted in the ' Transactions of the Hert- 
fordshire Natural History Society,' to print in small type, at the end of each 
paper, on the bottom of the page, the above particulars, which need not occupy 
more than one line and look best in italics. If that be done, what a bibliographer 
requires to know cannot be lost. 

There are very few of these conditions, T may perhaps call them rules, which 
are generally observed in the publications of our smaller natural history societies. 



728 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914, 

Many such call their publications 'Annual Reports.' They may consist of not 
more than one or two sheets octavo (sixteen or thirty-two pages)^, each Report 
being separately paged. It may take ten or twenty to form a volume sufficiently 
thick to bind. As usually they have neither table of contents nor index, to ascer- 
tain whether a volume thus made up contains a paper on a certain subject nearly 
every page has to be turned over. There is as a rule no indication of the date of 
issue, and this is also usually the case with the separate parts of more pretentious 
publications, which may be called 'Journals,' 'Transactions,' or 'Proceedings,' 
at least after the covers have been removed, copies without the covers bound in 
being then absolutely useless to a bibliographer. Sometimes the index appears 
at the beginning, when one naturally looks for it at the end, such index occasion- 
ally being called ' Contents.' An index is, of course, alphabetical, and it is 
advisable that there should be only one, and not separate indexes of names, 
places, and subjects. Contents should comprise a list of the papers in the 
sequence in which they appear in the volume. 

There is only one other point to which I desire to call attention, and that is 
the nature of the contents of the ipublications of a Local Natural History 
Society. The papers printed should be almost entirely those giving the results 
of original work, and, at least in a small society, for the sake of economy, as 
little space as possible should be given up to such things as rules and lists of 
members. It will usually suffice when a volume, as already defined, extends over 
several years, as is frequently the case with a small society, to give such things 
once only in each volume. Let me give you examples : one will suffice of the 
wrong way and two of the right waj', and I may absolve myself from libel if I 
do not give the name of the society which transgresses. Its last publication is 
called 'Annual Report and Proceedings.' It is paged 1-48, not forming part of 
a volume. Except on the cover there is no date nor place of publication. Its 
chief contents are the Rules and Library Rules : Additions to Museum and 
Library ; Financial Statement ; Hon. Secretary's, Curator's, and Sectional Secre- 
taries" Reports; and Lists of Members, past Presidents, and Associated Societies. 
The only additions to our knowledge of the Natural History of its locality are 
contained in a few pages of the Sectional Secretaries' Reports. The subscriptions 
of its members exceed 200/. per annum. 

As examples of what I think should be published I w-ill take the last part of 
the ' Transactions of the Hertfordsliire Natural History Society,' the Society of 
which our present Chairman, Sir H. George Fordham, is now President, and the 
last part of the 'Journal of the Hastings and St. Leonards Natural History 
Society ' issued imder the main title of the ' Hastings and East Sussex Naturalist.' 
The Herts Society's 'Transactions' form Part 3 of Vol. XV., running from 
p. 105 to p. 192, and contain the following papers : Mimicry and Protective 
Resemblance (being tlie former President's Address) ; The Building of a Mille- 
pede's Nest (illustrated); Hertfordshire False-scorpions; Note on the Occurrence 
of Pahnodictyon viride in Hertfordshire; The Crustacea of West Herts; The 
Weather of the year 1912 in Hertfordshire; On some Strata recently exposed in 
the Railway Cutting between Oxhey and Pinner; Notes on Birds observed in 
Hertfordshire during the year 1912 ; Hertfordshire Gentians ; Botanical Observa- 
tions in Hertfordshire during the years 1911 and 1912 ; Report on Land and Fresh- 
water MoUusca observed in Hertfordshire in 1912 : Recent Discoveries of Pre- 
historic Horse Remains in the Valley of the Stort (illustrated) ; Witches' Brooms 
on the Beech; The Weight-lifting Powers of Wasps; and Report on the Plieno- 
logical Observations in Hertfordshire for the year 1912 ; with eight pages of 
Proceedings, xvii-xxiv. The papers were read between October 1912 and 
November 1913, and not one can be taken out without all which a bibliographer 
requires to know being on it, for at the bottom of the last page of each paper is 
the line Trans. Hertfordshire \at. Hist. Soc, Vol. XV., Part 3, Mat/ 1914. 
The Society is only a small one, the subscriptions of its members scarcely 
amounting to 50/. per annum. It has published an excellent ' Flora of Hertford- 
shire. ' 

' The Hastings and East Sussex Naturalist ' runs from p. 91 to p. 142 of 
Vol. II. The contents of the part are : Autobiographical Note by the Rev. E. N. 
Bloomfield (with portrait) ; Pioneer Work on the Fauna and Flora of the Hastings 
District ; Annual Notes on the Local Fauna and Flora' ; Note on Mycene Crocata, 



CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES. 729 

Fries; On the Recent Incursion of Waxwings; On the Arrival of Summer 
Migratory Birds in the Hastings District, 1893-1913 ; Rare and Unique Sussex 
Oligochets ; A Cross-channel current at St. Leonards ; and Wealden Floras : an 
admirable selection of local papers. There is, however, one slight omission, 
that is, a headline to each page, which should give the title, abbreviated when 
required, of each paper, and there is one very serious error : the date on the cover 
is correctly given as July 14, 1914, but the only date inside, on the first page, 
is April 18, 1914, so that were the cover removed that would be assumed to be the 
date of publication. There are important new records of species the correct date 
of the publication of which is essential, and this antedates them by three months. 
I need only add that I shall be pleased to near any comments on my views. 
Though you may think that I have been rather severe in my strictures on those 
■who unduly augment the labours of a bibliographer, I hope you will admit that I 
have been so a bon droit. 

The Secretary announced that no communication had been received from 
the Essex Field Club which had suggested the compilation of an index to the 
publications of Local Scientific Societies.' 

Dr. F. A. Bather (Museums Association) welcomed the practical suggestions 
of the author with regard to methods of publication. They were essentially 
the same as those made some twenty years ago by a British Association Com- 
mittee on Zoological Bibliography and Publication, and distributed widely. 
One point, however, was not dealt with by the author, namely, the distribution 
of authors' copies in advance of publication ; as to this, practical suggestions made 
by the Committee had been adopted by many societies, including eventually 
the British Association itself. The proposal to form a general index did not 
seem of a value commensurate with the labour. Each volume, of course, should 
be indexed, but for the rest the indexes and analytical bibliographies already 
being produced (e.g., Zoological Record) should suffice. He would refer dele- 
gates to a report on the proper method of making up books recently issued by 
the Library Association and reviewed in The Museums Journal. 

The Chairman said he agreed with the author, and would go still further 
by suggesting that in all cases a paper should begin on an odd page. He 
thought that the publication by local societies of their work would always be 
necessary, inasmuch as, for want of space, that work could not be adequately 
recorded by central or general societies. He proposed a vote of thanks to Mr. 
Hopkinson, which was unanimously accorded. 

Mr. T. Sheppahd spoke on the question of the publication of a general index, 
with some doubt as to its practicability. The work was so very enormous. 
With regard to Yorkshire alone, he had been busy with an index now for over 
three years, and when completed for the Yorkshire Geological Society it would 
probably cost well over 100?. Many societies had already prepared an index 
to their publications when they had covered a nimiber of years. These, and the 
well-known general indexes, and bibliographies issued from time to time, should 
suffice. 

Dr. F. A. Bather regretted that, by the rules of the British Association, a 
premium had been placed on the issue of publications, and thought that aid 
would be valuable to and valued by the smaller societies, which often did good 
work but wisely refrained from needless publication. As for the collection of 
publications made by the British Association, it would be of more value to 
scientific workers if it could be transferred to the Library of the British Museum 
(Natural History), which experienced great difficulty in obtaining very many of 
these local reports. 

Mr. John- Hopkinson (Hertfordshire Natural History Society) could not 
admit Dr. Garson's contention that good work was not done gratuitously. He 
was familiar with the methods of management of many of our provincial 
societies, and could testify to the self-sacrificing devotion of their secretaries 
to the duties of their office; some of the best original work was also done by 
amateurs, especially in geological investigations. He could assure Dr. Bather 
that the British Association did not ignore the smaller non-publishing societies ; 

^ A paper by Mr. William Cole, A.L.S., and Mr. Henry Whitehead, B.Sc, 
has since come to hand and is appended. 



730 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 

for in addition to the Affiliated Societies -which publish the results of original 
local investigation, there are Associated Societies which need not so publish, 
but must consist of at least fifty members, and have been established not less 
than three years. The Delegate from an Affiliated Society must be a Member 
of the Association, that from an Associated Society may be an Associate, and 
although they had not quite the same privileges, all met on equal terms at the 
Conferences. 

The meeting concluded with a vote of thanks to the Vice-Chairmaii for 
presiding. 

.4 Bibliograpliy of the Publications of Local Scientific Societies. 

We venture to place before the Conference some suggestions for a piece of 
work which might be undertaken by the Coromittee of the Conference, on behalf 
of the British Association, to the great benefit and encouragement of the numerous 
amateur naturalists in the country, and a work which would even be useful to 
students and practical workers in science of higher pretensions. It is that » 
full bibliography of all papers contained in the Transactions and Journals of 
Local Scientific Societies of Great Britain and Ireland should be compiled and 
published. The value of such a work has forcibly suggested itself during the 
collation and binding up of the extensive series of these publications contained 
in the library of the Essex Field Club. It was abundantly evident how much 
information, the result of painstaking research, lies practically buried in these 
Transactions and Journals, information which cannot be obtained from any other 
sources. A classical instance may be mentioned of Mendel's work lying un- 
known for over thirty years. 

Methods. — ■Some suggestions as to methods may be put forward. The 
British Association should supply index-slips to each society. The societies 
should midertake to catalogue (under Subjects and Authoi-s) by means of such 
slips, the more important papers and notes which have been publi.shed in their 
Journals during the whole course of their existence. In doing this it should be 
borne in mind that even short papers may be of great importance as containing 
local facts or giving suggestions for future work. And the active officers of 
each society would be the best judges of the value of such pajoers and notes. 
The index-slips should then be forwarded to an expert bibliographer ai^pointed 
by the British Association. 

Each society should also furnish full information as to the titles and mode 
of publication of their Journals and other works published by them, together 
with notification of such libraries as are known to contain these books. 

The bibliography might be published in two forms : — 

(1) Ordinary book form printed on both sides of the paper. 

(2) .Slip-index form. 

By means of the second mode of publication each society would be able to 
obtain an index of its own publications separately from the complete biblio- 
graphy. As many societies have acquired extensive libraries by exchange, such 
a bibliography as the one suggested would be an invaluable adjunct to their 
catalogue of publications. Each society whose publications are thus indexed 
might be asked to subscribe for at least one copy of the bibliography, and 
inasmuch as this would serve in many cases as an index catalogue to their own 
libraries, doubtless a very considerable number of individual members would 
also subscribe. And a great number of public libraries, and libraries of 
societies, both here and in America, Avould also subscribe, so that in all 
probability the publication of the bibliography would pay for itself. 

Although scientific periodicals other than those published by societies have 
been excluded from our scheme, the publishers of important scientific journals 
should be approached in order to see if it would be possible to extend the 
bibliography in this direction. 

We mei-ely put these terse suggestions forward as a basis for future dis- 
cussion. The full working out of the scheme could be elaborated later. But 
we are fully impressed with the importance and interest of the work.

Dr. F. A. Bather, F.E.S., representing the Museums Association, also attended

On July 31 Dr. Ciarson, Mr. Hopkinson, Mr. Rousselet, Mr. Sheppard, and 
Mr. Webb* attended a joint meeting of the Education Section of the French 
Association and the Conference of Delegates of the British Association called 
to consider the advisability of instituting a Conference similar to the British one. 

Professor Julien Ray presided. 

The following subjects were discussed : — 

I. Co-ordination of the Work of Local Societies. 

Dr. Loir explained the arrangements and the objects of the meetings held 
in connection with the British Association by the Delegates of Corresponding 
Societies. 

He asked that the French Societies should be represented on the Council of 
the French Association for the Advancement of Science. Up to the present, this 
had not been the case. The French Association sent lecturers to the societies. 
With the Congress of learned Societies this is not the end in view. 

Mr. Hopkinson {Hertfordshire Natural History Society), complying with the 
request of the President, gave a brief outline of the origin and early history of 
the Conferences of Delegates. He said that when he became a member of the 
British Association (in 1871) the President of any scientific society publishing 
Transactions, or in his absence a Delegate representing him, might claim to be a 
member of the General Committee at the meeting he attended, and the names of 
those whose claims were admitted, and of their societies, were printed separately 
in the list of members. It occurred to him that it might be to the advantage of 
the societies, and perhaps also of the Association, if these Delegates could meet 
to discuss matters relating chiefly to the management of their societies and the 
original woi-k which might usefully be done by them, but as the rule stood if 
their Presidents were present their Secretaries could not be Delegates, and it was 
most important for the Secretaries to meet. Therefore at the meeting in 1879 
he suggested to the Council of the Association the admission, as a member of the 
General Committee, of the Secretai'y of any duly qualified society as well as the 
President, and this sugge.stion being favourably received, a new rule adopting it 



732 REPORTS ON THE STATE OF SCIENCE. — 1914. 

•was duly passed. The first Conference was held at Swansea in 1880, and at this 
a Committee, consisting of Sir George Fordham and himself, was appointed to 
arrange for future Conferences. These were held, unoflBcially but with the 
sanction of the Council, at York in 1881, Southampton in 1882 (when Professor 
Meldola was added to the Committee), Southpoi-t in 1883, -and Montreal in 
1884. After this a Corresponding Societies Committee was officially appointed to 
manage the Conferences of Delegates, and the rules were altered, reducing the 
number of Delegates from each society to one, who need not be either President 
or Secretary of his society. 

During the period of the unofficial Conferences, in 1882, a ' Circular referring 
to Subjects recommended for Investigation by Local Scientific Societies ' was 
issued to the Corresponding and other Societies. This included the work of 
three Committees of the British Association and three subjects investigated by 
other societies or by individuals. In 1890 the Hertfordshire Natural History 
Society issued a circular extending that list, but omitting one Committee which 
had concluded its labours. This list was as follows : — A. Investigations con- 
ducted by Committees of the British Association : 1. Temperature of Surface- 
water. 2. Underground Waters. 3. Erosion of Sea-coast. 4. Erratic Boulders. 
5. Geological Photography. 6. Disappearance of Native Plants. 7. Fresh- 
water Fauna and Flora. 8. Pre-historic Remains. B. Investigations conducted 
by other Societies or by Individual Observers : 1. Rainfall. 2. Phenological 
Phenomena. 3. Injurious Insects. 4. Archfeological Survey of England. In 
each case brief instructions to observers were given, and also the names and 
addresses of those to whom the results were to be communicated. This circular, 
copies of which were sent to most of our provincial societies, appears to have 
done much to direct their attention and their energies into useful channels. He 
might add that the Corresponding Societies entered con amore into the project, 
each Society or Delegate subscribing 2s. 6d. per annum for the cost of the first 
five Conferences, chiefly expended in printing reports of them which were sent 
to all the societies. 

Mr. HoPKiNSON then said that he would leave to Dr. Garson the duty of 
explaining the organisation of the Conferences of Delegates by the Corresponding 
Societies Committee as an official department of the British Association from the 
year 1885, and he concluded his remarks with an expression of gratification at 
the courteous request of the Association Frangaise that we would explain our 
methods to them, and the compliment implied by this request. 

Dr. G.4RS0N then gave some further details supplementing what had been said 
by Mr. Hopkinson, and pointing out the advantages derived by the Affiliated 
Societies. 

Dr. Loir and Professor Ray : This is the object to be pursued in France ; 
we ought to follow the lead of the British Association and report what has been 
said at the Conference to the various French Societies. 

II. The Question of Units. 

Monsieur J. Heneiet raised the question with regard to the changes which 
were to be made in the French Units. 

Dr. Garson spoke of the recent introduction of the metric system in England 
into biological and medical investigations. 

Mr. Hopkinson said that the British Meteorological Office had recently 
adopted the metric system in the publication in the 'Monthly Weather Report' 
of certain meteorological observations. From May 1 this year barometer read- 
ings were given in centibars and millibars (to the tenth of a millibar), rainfall 
observations in millimetres, and wind velocities in gales in metres per second. 

Mr. Wilfred Mark Webb, at the request of the meeting, undertook to ask 
the Council of the British Association to give an opinion direct or through the 
appropriate Committee on the changes in the French system on receiving details 
of the same. 

The result of the meeting was that it was decided to arrange a Conference at 
the meeting of the French Association in 1915 as nearly as -was possible on the 
lines of the British one.
